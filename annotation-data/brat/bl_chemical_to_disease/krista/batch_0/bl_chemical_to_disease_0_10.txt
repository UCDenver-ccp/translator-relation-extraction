We conclude that manganese oxidation is the origin of the increase of the OER overpotential at pH lower than 14 and also of the pH dependence on the RHE scale. -- PMID:31359564
Lycopene, sulforaphane, quercetin, and curcumin applied together show improved antiproliferative potential in colon cancer cells in vitro. -- PMID:31353575
Through direct or indirect action on proteins related to the pyroptosis signaling pathway, lncRNAs are involved in the pathological processes related to cardiovascular diseases, kidney diseases, immune diseases and other diseases. -- PMID:31794769
The Barrett-IOL Master demonstrated that 61% and 76% of eyes were within 0.50 and 0.75 D of the predicted residual astigmatism, respectively. -- PMID:31364401
Grape Seed Procyanidin B2 Protects Porcine Ovarian Granulosa Cells against Oxidative Stress-Induced Apoptosis by Upregulating let-7a Expression. -- PMID:31827667
Our results add to a growing body of literature hinting at metabolic changes-in particular of triglycerides-independently of medication status in schizophrenia. -- PMID:31504541
To illustrate how the index may be used, we estimated CUI for fasting glucose, both as a continuous and as a dichotomous test, at several values of pretest probability of diabetes mellitus and at two levels of cost/benefit-ratio. -- PMID:31675254
In IR group, numerous charcoal labeled KCs were observed mainly localized around the central vein. -- PMID:31078256
After overexpression of mitomiR-181a-5p, mt-CYB and mt-CO2 levels were reduced in HCC cells, and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) maintained by the electron transport chain (ETC) was decreased. -- PMID:31628462
Subsequent siRNA-mediated knockdown of BMMSC-CD9 in DP-HCC1806:BMMSCs resulted in an attenuation of doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil chemoresistance associated with decreased BCRP and serum cytokine expression (CCL5, CCR5, CXCR12). -- PMID:31191817

Theoretical determination of the effects of various linkages between trinitrobenzenes on energetic properties and sensitivity. -- PMID:31522270
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was done with matched primary tumors and fallopian tubes (n = 8 pairs) as well as matched metastatic and primary tumors (n = 11 pairs) from ovarian cancer patients. -- PMID:31600962
Among patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, the risk of dementia was lower in the oral diabetes medication group than in the no-medication group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.79; 95% CI 0.77-0.81). -- PMID:31279960
