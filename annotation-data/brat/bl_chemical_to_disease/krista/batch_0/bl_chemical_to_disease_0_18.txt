We conclude that the 20% with lowest SELENOP concentrations in a North European population without history of cardiovascular disease have markedly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and preventive selenium supplementation studies stratified for these subjects are warranted. -- PMID:31404994
-resveratrol of this species was demonstrated to have chondroprotective effects as a lead compound for the treatment of osteoarthritis, but it has not been applied due to its low efficacy. -- PMID:31384819
