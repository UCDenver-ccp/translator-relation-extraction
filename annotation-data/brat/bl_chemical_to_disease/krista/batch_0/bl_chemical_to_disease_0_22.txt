Dietary compounds have potential in controlling atherosclerosis by modulating macrophage cholesterol metabolism and inflammation via miRNA. -- PMID:31304263
To report a case of successful intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction after a 360-degree gonioscopy-assisted transluminal trabeculotomy (GATT) using the iTrack catheter in a patient with steroid-induced glaucoma as a result of treatment of vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC). -- PMID:31574020
Further studies with more samples size to study the importance of this bacterium and its toxins in the investigation of colorectal cancer patients survey is recommended. -- PMID:31749925
The evidence gathered in this paper, as well as other laboratories, support the importance of MCT6 in regulating a variety of glucose and lipid metabolic pathways, which may indicate its significance in metabolic diseases. -- PMID:31436537
On the other hand, it could also help to promote viral evasion of certain viruses by direct and indirect mechanisms, with the presence of the microbiota increasing infection and viruses using LPS and surface polysaccharides from bacteria to trigger immunosuppressive pathways. -- PMID:31380299
Caudal fin regeneration experiments were conducted using various concentrations of a GSK3Î² inhibitor, examining duration and concentration dependence on regenerative outgrowth. -- PMID:31010223
Afterwards, we conducted a physical examination and obtained blood and urine samples to screen for blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and the lipid profile. -- PMID:31073107
In order to functionally analyze phosphorylation of P. falciparum HP1 (PfHP1), we first mapped PfHP1 phosphorylation sites by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of native PfHP1, which identified motifs from which potential kinases could be predicted; in particular, several phosphorylated residues were embedded in motifs rich in acidic residues, reminiscent of targets for P. falciparum casein kinase 2 (PfCK2). -- PMID:31723180
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the involved renal arteries has been reported; however, few studies have reported the use of drug coated balloon angioplasty in the treatment of Takayasu arteritis. -- PMID:31616707
Subsequent treatment of adult ITP is typically with thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs; romiplostim or eltrombopag), rituximab, or splenectomy. -- PMID:31830764
Position-dependent correlation between TBX22 exon 5 methylation and palatal shelf fusion in the development of cleft palate. -- PMID:31241704
[Effect of dental implants with conditioned surface based on sodium hydroxide in patients with osteoporosis]. -- PMID:31322594
This behavior is in sharp contrast to that observed when the incoming projectile ion is monoatomic. -- PMID:31153221
Naringin-G did not decrease the surface tension, whereas SDS showed a surface-active property and critical micelle concentration. -- PMID:31271814
The co-occurrence of chronic pain and alcohol use disorders (AUDs) involves complex interactions between genetic and neurophysiological aspects, and the research has reported mixed findings when they both co-occur. -- PMID:31237390
Roles, Actions, and Therapeutic Potential of Specialized Pro-resolving Lipid Mediators for the Treatment of Inflammation in Cystic Fibrosis. -- PMID:31001110
In fact, exogenous glucagon given under fed conditions did robustly stimulate insulin secretion and lower glycemia. -- PMID:31335319
To assess FDG uptake in small bowel adenocarcinoma, we retrospectively analyzed a large, single-center database and determined the expression of glucose-transporter type 1 (GLUT-1). -- PMID:31271267
In regard to other variables that may affect response to therapy in TTP patients, we found no association between obesity and NoP; however, obesity rate was higher among ADAMTS13 deficient patients compared to overall obesity rate of our regional general population. -- PMID:31778944
