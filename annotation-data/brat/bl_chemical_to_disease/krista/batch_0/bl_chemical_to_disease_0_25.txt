Increasing evidence suggest a bidirectional link between disrupted circadian rhythms and alcohol use disorders (AUD). -- PMID:31809833
Our results highlight the importance of unOc as a hormone in promoting the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, indicating that this hormone may be beneficial in treatments for osteoporosis and fracture healing. -- PMID:31674048
The inverse association between plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration and the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been unequivocally proven by many epidemiological studies. -- PMID:31135593
A phase II study showed longer survival in patients with recurrent GBM who received neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy than in those who received it as adjuvant therapy. -- PMID:31567548
A descriptor known as strain work to fracture turns out to be a good descriptor for evaluating the hydro-thermal fatigue of the tested polymer-ceramic composites. -- PMID:31698746
The PPI analysis results showed that Golgi membrane protein 1 (GOLM1), melanoma inhibitory activity member 3 (MIA3), ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) and G protein subunit β2 (GNB2) were the key genes in PCa, and the Module analysis revealed that they were associated with 'ECM-receptor interaction', 'focal adhesion', the 'PI3K-Akt pathway' and the 'metabolic pathway'. -- PMID:31579071

Sprague Dawley rats were fed with a chow, a high-fat diet (HFD), or a PFE-supplemented diet for 8 weeks. -- PMID:31538163
In this study, we evaluated whether ssDNA libraries captured more circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA). -- PMID:31654347
The general questions of the pathogenesis of the syndrome of excessive bacterial growth in the intestine, the participation of opportunistic microflora, the deficit of representatives of normal microflora, changes in the species composition of bile acids in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are considered. -- PMID:31094185

The specificity, sensitivity and flexibility of this technique allow unparalleled insights into RNA metabolism. -- PMID:31498317
EES treatment for 31 days decreased hepatic and tumor SOD activity, tumor IL-10 levels and Cyclin D1 expression, and increased tumor reduced glutathione, N-acetylglucosaminidase, reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, TNF-α levels and Nrf2 expression. -- PMID:31270760
Apart from cancer cells, PD-L1 silencing on host immune cells such as APC and DC can also enhance T cell immunity, leading to tumor clearance. -- PMID:31507611
In this open-label, multicohort study, we assigned 47 patients with untreated or relapsed BPDCN to receive an intravenous infusion of tagraxofusp at a dose of 7 μg or 12 μg per kilogram of body weight on days 1 to 5 of each 21-day cycle. -- PMID:31018069
