The progression of Parkinson disease can lead to respiratory muscle weakness, reduced peak expiratory flow and quality of life (QoL). -- PMID:31113177
Blood was sampled from the hepatic vein and the femoral artery and suPAR was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. -- PMID:31465463
Intervention in this pathway could prevent allergen sensitization and subsequent Th2 allergic inflammation. -- PMID:31385613
Consistent with this, analysis of the Human Protein Atlas database indicated that the expression levels of the CDH3 protein were upregulated in COAD tissues (n=11) compared with those in normal tissues (n=3; P=0.0245). -- PMID:31281458
The variability of the clinical phenotype together with histopathologic findings suggests that several molecular pathways may be involved in the disease pathomechanism, such as nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, protein aggregation, and defective protein turnover. -- PMID:31192305
Acute deletion of Mettl14 in β-cells results in glucose intolerance as a result of a reduction in insulin secretion in β-cells even though β-cell mass is increased, which is related to increased β-cell proliferation. -- PMID:31369074
Viral persistence and immune defects are the two major reasons for CHB, and it was hypothesized that based on a transient clearance of serum viral DNA and HBsAg "window stage", active immunization against hepatitis B virus (HBV) might initiate effective host immune responses versus HBV to achieve functional cure of CHB. -- PMID:31680000
Rescue experiments demonstrated that miR-195 inhibitor abrogated the beneficial role of circVANGL1 knockdown in NSCLC cells. -- PMID:31076544
Methylation profile of genes involved in inflammation, in the blood from pregnancies with maternal preeclampsia due to untreated gestational diabetes mellitus. -- PMID:31154656
In this study, we aimed to explore the cut-off value of IFG via the associations of blood lipids with fasting plasma glucose (FPG). -- PMID:31405610
To evaluate the role of diffusion kurtosis and diffusivity as potential imaging biomarkers to predict response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) from baseline staging magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). -- PMID:31154482
A total of 24 female Sprague-Dawley (SD) 21 days old were randomly divided into control group (n=12) and PCOS group (n=12). -- PMID:31298309
Stool-Based miR-92a and miR-144* as Noninvasive Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer Screening. -- PMID:31216561
Accumulating evidence suggests that diets rich in ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) offer protection against vascular inflammation, neuroinflammation, hypertension, and thrombosis. -- PMID:31562632
The polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (PAS) type III is a rare condition defined as the coexistence of autoimmune thyroid disorder with other endocrine autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, without adrenal dysfunction. -- PMID:31149156
There were significant differences in APT values of the HIE group in bilateral caudate, bilateral thalamus, bilateral centrum semiovale and left globus pallidus/putamen (p < 0.05), and no statistical difference was observed in right globus pallidus/putamen (p = 0.051) and brainstem (p = 0.073) between the two groups. -- PMID:31422164
Changes in Conjunctiva Morphology Using Impression Cytology in Patients with Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis without Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy -- PMID:31497938
The image findings at that time suggested a malignant lymphoma, and consequently, we performed a right radical orchiectomy. -- PMID:31327858
Acceptance: a factor to consider in persistent pain after neck trauma. -- PMID:31203263
This condition is widely treated by calcimimetics like cinacalcet which act by allosteric activation of the calcium sensing receptor. -- PMID:31424183
