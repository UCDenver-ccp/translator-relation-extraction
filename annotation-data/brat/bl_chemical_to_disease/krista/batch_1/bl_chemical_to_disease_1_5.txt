Among these genes, two up-regulated genes were reported with involvement in lipid metabolism in the liver, implying the direct effect of feed-induced acidosis on both the rumen microbial community and liver metabolism. -- PMID:31831817
To systematically review the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and patient acceptable symptom state (PASS) estimates in pain and function measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) in patients who underwent primary total knee replacement (TKR) and primary total hip replacement (THR). -- PMID:31096046
Based on our bioinformatic and placental biochemical analyses, we concluded that maternal obesity is associated with abnormal carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased steroid hormone biosynthesis, and increased oxidative stress and inflammation in the placenta. -- PMID:31408947
The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinicopathological significance and prognostic role of programmed death-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2) expression in colorectal cancer according to intratumoral components. -- PMID:31337259
With the advancement of molecular and genetic tools, our comprehension of the intracellular signals activated in bone cells has evolved significantly, from early suggestions that osteoblasts and osteoclasts have common precursors and that osteocytes are inert cells in the bone matrix, to the very sophisticated understanding of a network of receptors, ligands, intracellular kinases/phosphatases, transcription factors, and cell-specific genes that are known today. -- PMID:31036293
These cases of 'non-specific' pleuritis need to be followed up for at least one year, as 10-15% of them will eventually lead to the diagnosis of cancer, typically malignant pleural mesothelioma. -- PMID:31463153
Glucagon signaling increases hepatic glucose output, and hyperglucagonemia is partly responsible for the hyperglycemia in diabetes making glucagon an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. -- PMID:31653720
Evaluation of topical human platelet lysate versus topical clobetasol in management of methotrexate-induced oral ulceration in rheumatoid arthritis patients: Randomized-controlled clinical trial. -- PMID:31151076
Demographics, drinking measures (Timeline followback past 90 days (TLFB90), Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)), and alcohol hangover scale (AHS) were analyzed. -- PMID:31718086
This study was a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent endoscopic hemispherotomy for drug-resistant epilepsy. -- PMID:31703206
Using aspiration and pharyngeal residues, the objective of this study was to elucidate the efficacy of the three screening tests performed by non-experts in patients who had swallowing disorders. -- PMID:31037446
In light of the recommendation of folic acid supplementation in chronic hemolytic anemia, with possible supratherapeutic dosing and associated side effects, we performed this study to investigate serum folate levels in children with chronic hemolytic anemia. -- PMID:31724541
Antidepressive Effects of Kamishoyosan through 5-HT1AReceptor and PKA-CREB-BDNF Signaling in the Hippocampus in Postmenopausal Depression-Model Mice. -- PMID:31781286
HR HPV genotyping and virus quantification was performed on 101 residual anal Pap test samples (28 negative, 25 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC], 34 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [LSIL], 6 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and 8 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) using multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. -- PMID:31051676
In this study, we successfully prepared a porous hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffold that is functionalized by poly(L-lysine)/polydopamine (PLL/PDA) hybrid coating. -- PMID:31005742
Our results do not fit a simple pattern of enhanced gambling distortions or reward sensitivity, but help contextualise the effects of alcohol on gambling to research on decision-making biases. -- PMID:31664479
Listeria innocua strain Lin11 was used to compare the inhibitory activity of two bacteriocins (nisin A and pediocin AcH) in a decontamination process consisting of soaking artificially contaminated pieces of raw pork meat in a bacteriocin-containing solution before they were ground and stored aerobically at 5°C. -- PMID:31207757
Towards regulatory endorsement of drug development tools to promote the application of model-informed drug development in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. -- PMID:31127458
TUG score increased with greater AD spectrum severity (all p < 0.001), whereas OLST score showed a precipitous impairment starting in the SCD group (all p < 0.001), even after adjusting for age, sex, MMSE-KC, Geriatric depression scale, and body mass index. -- PMID:31815691
The present systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials aimed to determine the effectiveness of hesperidin supplementation in improving blood glucose control in adults. -- PMID:31489695
