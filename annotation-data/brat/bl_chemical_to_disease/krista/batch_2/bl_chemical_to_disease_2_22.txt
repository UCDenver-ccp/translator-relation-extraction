This straightforward, cost-effective and rapid method, determining iohexol, PAH and creatinine within one single chromatographic run, has been successfully used for the analysis in porcine and broiler chicken plasma samples in order to determine the renal function of these species. -- PMID:31004849
Remarkably, the Peñahueca sulfate-rich metagenome contained CRISPR-associated proteins and repetitions which were over 10-fold higher than in most hypersaline systems analysed so far. -- PMID:31087616
The crystal structures of CDD-1, the intrinsic class D β-lactamase from the pathogenic Gram-positive bacterium Clostridioides difficile, and its complex with cefotaxime. -- PMID:31550535
Selenium-rich maize modulates the expression of prostaglandin genes in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. -- PMID:31062009
IGF-1 polymorphisms modulate the susceptibility to osteonecrosis of the femoral head among Chinese Han population. -- PMID:31169709
Additionally, chromium administration significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (β - 5.01 mmHg; 95% CI, - 9.04, - 0.97; P = 0.01) compared with the placebo. -- PMID:31243685
The SOD1 mutants were recombinantly produced and their activity, structure and stability were investigated using biochemical methods, CD and DSC methods. -- PMID:31230748
In this study, we investigated the role of a regulator of G-protein signaling 5 (RGS5) protein, which regulates AT1R activity, in angiotensin II-induced brain oxidative stress, inflammation and anxiety-, and depression-like behavior. -- PMID:31625976
A number of teams have investigated the association between the mode of anesthesia and the long-term outcomes after cancer surgeries, with inconsistent conclusions. -- PMID:31333811
ES suppresses lung cancer progression by down-regulating HGF-Met signaling, revealing the possible mechanism of ES in the process of treating lung cancer patients. -- PMID:31096000
Additionally, we found that peripheral nerve injury-related behavioral and biochemical changes were significantly reduced by necrostatin-1. -- PMID:31156396
Using an experimental infectious challenge model in healthy adults, norovirus infection elicited a time-limited inflammatory response associated with altered serum concentrations of certain iron and vitamin A biomarkers, confirming the need to consider adjustments of these biomarkers to account for inflammation when assessing nutritional status. -- PMID:31504095
High GILT Expression and an Active and Intact MHC Class II Antigen Presentation Pathway Are Associated with Improved Survival in Melanoma. -- PMID:31591149
He underwent explorative laparotomy in emergency setting, and cholecystectomy was performed due to his toxic clinical condition. -- PMID:31183222
A total of 72 cancer patients (experimental group = 37, control group = 35) who were currently receiving treatment and staying at home were enrolled. -- PMID:31743151
≤ 0.01) in the serum of patients with psoriasis considered as potential biomarkers of the severityof psoriasis and control over their dynamics have prognostic significance in determining the effectiveness of the therapy. -- PMID:31281308
Biological studies were remarkable for PTH-independent severe hypercalcemia with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D and a paradoxically elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Early bronchoalveolar lavage allowed for PCP diagnosis and targeted treatment. -- PMID:31729682
Moreover, with advanced technological developments in the medicinal plant research, medicinal plant proteins such as Bowman-Birk protease inhibitor and Mistletoe Lectin-I are presently under clinical trials against prostrate cancer, oral carcinomas and malignant melanoma. -- PMID:31746291
However, compared with the group conversation condition, the RAPID-PFA group evidenced significantly lower state anxiety scores at postintervention and at 30-minute delay. -- PMID:31306290
Neurovascular glucocorticoid receptors and glucocorticoids: implications in health, neurological disorders and drug therapy. -- PMID:31541713
