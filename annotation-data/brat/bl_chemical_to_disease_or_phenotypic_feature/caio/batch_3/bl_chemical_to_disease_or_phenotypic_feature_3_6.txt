The experimental results showed that transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) increased the expression of G6PD by activating the forkhead box protein M1-high mobility group AT-hook 1-G6PD (FOXM1-HMGA1-G6PD) transcriptional regulatory pathway, in which TGFβ1 inhibited the ubiquitination and degradation of FOXM1 protein. -- PMID:31814893
