Mice with primary STS were injected with the protease-activatable probe LUM015 to label tumors.
We also observed that when field-acquired Noctiluca were cultivated with a mono-species food source, there was a shift in the associated bacterial communities. -- PMID:31818556
The content of ABA and its catabolites was followed in the roots and needles of seedlings of Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies under conditions of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced water deficiency (-0.15 and -0.5 MPa) for 10 days. -- PMID:31091491
Only one patient presented short stature without growth hormone deficiency and anosmia.
A man with a subclinical cobalamin deficiency developed syncope, vertigo, paresthesias, and ataxia after two exposures to nitrous oxide anesthesia.
Fatal TTR amyloidosis with neuropathy from domino liver p.Val71Ala transplant. -- PMID:31517060
Potential biomarkers of autism.
Growth hormone therapy in calcium-loaded rats with renal failure.
Dysregulation in the extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment surrounding the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) has been implicated in the etiology of proliferative vitreoretinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. -- PMID:31439888
Fifteen weeks antepartum, 38 multiparous Holstein cows were allocated to either a high body condition group (HBCS; n = 19) or a normal body condition group (NBCS; n = 19) and were fed different diets until dry-off (d -49 relative to calving) to amplify the difference. -- PMID:31587900
Meanwhile, a series of biological evaluations demonstrated that the HMSNs-PDA-PEG@QD exhibited remarkable ability to overcome MDR compared with free DOX and HMSNs-PDA-PEG@DOX. -- PMID:31408782
Therefore, sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors may have a chemopreventive effect on obesity-related hepatocellular carcinoma.
Histamine H(3) receptor antagonists are potential therapeutic agents for cognitive dysfunction, epilepsy, hypersomnia and obesity.
A suitable biomarker should allow predicting the severity of the infection in a simple and opportune manner and should ideally be obtained from non-invasive samples. -- PMID:31214165
Smaller tumors were found to recur more frequently than large tumors, and recovery was more common in cases of growth hormone deficiency and hypogonadism.
Altogether, we suggest that the elevated NETosis in blood can be used as a biomarker to detect early HNC and to predict patients at risk to develop tumor metastasis. -- PMID:31438586
By contrast, hyperglycemia increased tumor microvessel density and promoted tumor growth, which was inhibited by the HIF-1 inhibitor.
Chronic and acute complications may be encountered in patients with classical homocystinuria and plasma methionine concentrations pose an additional risk factor. -- PMID:31240166
CONCLUSION: In the literature, there are several case series about this topic, with some of them reporting unusual foreign bodies that lead to penetrating trauma. -- PMID:31420009
Coordination complexes have emerged as prominent modulators of amyloid aggregation via their interaction with the N-terminal histidine residues of amyloid-β (Aβ). -- PMID:31573804
