In one patient with astrocytoma, Tc-99m HMPAO showed partial tumor accumulation, less than that shown by Tl-201 chloride.
When these tumors achieved the same volume (0.3-0.4 cm3), in 10-11 days for tumors implanted in irradiated tissue and 7-8 days for control tumors, they were treated with radiation, the tumor blood flow inhibitor hydralazine, and hyperthermia, alone or in different combinations.
