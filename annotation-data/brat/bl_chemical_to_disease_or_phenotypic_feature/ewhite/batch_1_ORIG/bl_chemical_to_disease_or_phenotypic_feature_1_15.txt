A sublethal dose (50?nM) of the drug was used to model situations of limiting drug availability to PCa tumors in vivo.
The treatment at the Brazilian Unified Heath System (SUS) is performed with calcitriol, a drug which favors hypercalcemia and/or hyperphosphatemia, hindering the control of SHPT.
Perioperative outcome parameters were average operation time in and out, operation duration, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative hemodynamic parameters, preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin, blood transfusion rate, total patient-controlled anesthesia (PCA) morphine usage, length of postoperative hospitalization and complications. -- PMID:31574058
