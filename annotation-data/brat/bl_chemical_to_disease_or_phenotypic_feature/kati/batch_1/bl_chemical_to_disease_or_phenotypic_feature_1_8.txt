Vaccination with peptides isolated from tumor cells circumvents the need for identifying specific tumor rejection antigens and extends the use of active immunotherapy to the majority of cancers where specific tumor antigens have not yet been identified.
The identification of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) has made possible the development of antigen-specific cancer immunotherapies such as tecemotide.

In general, ataxia tends to disappear after discontinuation of the drug, but chronic ataxia has been described for some drugs.
Water, creatinine and sodium excretion following circulatory shcok wtih renal failure.
Here, we developed a novel nano-micellar fenretinide formulation called bionanofenretinide (Bio-nFeR), based on drug encapsulation in an ion-pair stabilized lipid matrix, with the aim to raise fenretinide bioavailability and antitumour efficacy. -- PMID:31439019
Serum-growth hormone and glucose intolerance in renal failure.
There are several tumor markers for pancreatic and biliary tract cancers, such as carcinoembryonal antigen, pancreatic enzyme, carbohydrate antigen and tumor associated gene.
In summary, our novel rabbit model of cataracts will be an important drug-screening tool for cataract prevention and treatment.
