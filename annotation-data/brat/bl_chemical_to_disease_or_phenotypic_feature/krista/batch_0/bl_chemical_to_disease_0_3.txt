We sought to determine if interleukin (IL)-1β and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (inflammatory mediators in pancreatic fluid) together with serum carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 could better predict intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) dysplasia than individual biomarkers alone. -- PMID:31404023

This study aimed to identify the underlying genetic cause(s) of inherited retinal dystrophy (IRD) in 12 families of Kuwaiti origin affected by macular dystrophy and four Spanish patients affected by retinitis pigmentosa (RP). -- PMID:31079053
Caveolin1 interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor in the lung but is dispensable for its anti-inflammatory actions in lung inflammation and Trichuris Muris infection. -- PMID:31189975
Comparing three groups, the results were the following: (a) There was a significant difference in the genotype and allele distribution of rs34713741 between DN group and HC group and between T2DM group and DN group; For this gene locus, the risk of diabetic nephropathy in healthy individuals with T allele was 0.6 times higher than that in individuals with GG genotype (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.46 ~ 0.77). -- PMID:31265177
