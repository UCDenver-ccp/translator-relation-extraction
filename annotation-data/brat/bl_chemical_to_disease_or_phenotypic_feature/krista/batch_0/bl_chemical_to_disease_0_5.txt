These findings have raised interest in myricetin as a potential tumor inhibitor in human patients. -- PMID:31586904
This marked, for the first time in the United States, that a drug-eluting device was available to treat this complex arterial bed, and has likely changed forever how PAD is treated. -- PMID:31058479
A selective protein solubilization, SDS PAGE, trypsin digestion and MALDI MS/MS analysis allowed the identification of the 12 most stable hypoxia-regulated proteins. -- PMID:31831848
In this prospective cohort study, patients with CHB who were treated with nucleos(t)ide analogs and maintained undetectable levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for at least 6 months were enrolled. -- PMID:31370059
Ectopic Cushing syndrome secondary to corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH)-secreting tumors or CRH and adrenocorticotropin hormone cosecreting tumors is extremely rare. -- PMID:31714276
Ethnicity (Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and African), maternal age ≥25 years, vitamin use, frequent sexual intercourse (≥5 times/week) and use of sex toys were associated with GBS colonization. -- PMID:31013212

The importance of differentiating between local tumor recurrence, distant metastatic disease, and a combination of both in a patient with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer is essential for appropriate treatment selection. -- PMID:31788708
This proof-of-concept study showed that AAV-mediated delivery of a CaMKII peptide inhibitor to the heart was effective in suppressing arrhythmias in a murine model of CPVT. -- PMID:31155924
Further, despite a marked increase in overweight and obesity in women of reproductive age, at present, most programmes are focused on under-nutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. -- PMID:31743909
This study provided the experimental basis for further studied of WPPs as a possible functional food or adjuvant agent for prevention or treatment of prostate cancer. -- PMID:31765754
Although LC-MS provides a more accurate representation of the blood concentration of the parent compound tacrolimus exclusive of metabolite, established cut points for tacrolimus dosing may need to be adjusted to account for the increased risk of renal injury. -- PMID:31696925
Keloids are benign proliferative scars that often occur among individuals of color, and are thought to be the result of excessive collagen deposition that occurs after injury to the skin. -- PMID:31333945
