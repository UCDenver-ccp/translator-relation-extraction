On the other hand, although initially SDMA was thought to be an innocuous molecule, we now know that it is an outstanding marker of renal function both in human and in animal models, with ESRD patients on dialysis showing the highest SDMA levels. -- PMID:31357472
Diminished bone mineral density (i.e., osteopenia or osteoporosis) is associated with increased fracture risk. -- PMID:31828365
Development of drug resistance in cancer has major implications for patients' outcome. -- PMID:31249353
In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional role and the underlying molecular mechanisms of lncRNA HOXD cluster antisense RNA 1 (HOXD-AS1) in cisplatin (DDP) resistance in gastric cancer. -- PMID:31551012

Persistent organic pollutant lindane degradation by alkaline cold-brew green tea. -- PMID:31154189
The most common types of anemia in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of chronic disease (ACD).The differentiation between both is important and challenging. -- PMID:31333004
Curcumin-Induced Autophagy Augments Its Antitumor Effect against A172 Human Glioblastoma Cells. -- PMID:31405268
In conclusion, our results suggest that SIM may serve as a promising treatment with TAM for improving the efficacy against estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. -- PMID:31788433
We examined the capability of propagation-based phase-contrast tomography (PB-PCT) with single-distance phase retrieval for tracking of bone structure and mineral changes using monochromatic synchrotron light. -- PMID:31641229
All of these hypothetical precursors have a conserved ER-signal sequence, a Cysteine (C)-rich sequence forming two zinc finger motifs and a cyclotide-like region containing several conserved elements including two highly conserved C residues. -- PMID:31791808
Polytopic ligands have become ubiquitous in coordination chemistry because they grant access to a variety of mono- and polynuclear complexes of transition metals as well as rare-earth and main-group elements. -- PMID:31755598
Type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model was used, and TGP and paeoniflorin were intragastrically treated. -- PMID:31654988
