Here we determined whether PDXs and CRCs of the same cancer origin maintain the biological fidelity and complement each for translational research and drug development. -- PMID:31303270
Fatty acids profile is a sensitive marker of the development of potentially pathological changes in the liver. -- PMID:31752380
Using α-tocopherol (vitamin E) as a model vitamin, pharmacokinetics and kinetics principles were utilized to determine whether excess liver fat sequestered α-tocopherol in women with obesity-associated hepato-steatosis vs healthy controls.METHODS Custom-synthesized deuterated α-tocopherols (d3- and d6-α-tocopherols) were administered to hospitalized healthy women and women with hepato-steatosis under IND guidelines. -- PMID:31821172
Overall rates of hospital-acquired anaphylaxis, predominantly secondary to cephalosporins, are low, and also associated with low inpatient mortality. -- PMID:31637446
Sulfonamide moieties are effective scaffolds present in several compounds that are determinants to treat various diseases, principally neglected tropical diseases This review article examines the contribution of these scaffolds in medicinal chemistry in the last five years, focusing on three trypanosomatid parasites: Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei, and Leishmania ssp. -- PMID:31218962
In the present study, we investigated the potential effect of Moringa oleifera stem extract (MOSE) on cataract formation induced by oxidative stress in cultured mouse lenses. -- PMID:31226981
Activity of MUC1 cancer antigen-binding plasma anti-α-galactoside antibody correlates inversely with size of autologous lipoprotein(a). -- PMID:31397607
Isoniazid (INH) is a key element of the first line anti tuberculosis treatment regimen. -- PMID:31299893
Maternal zinc supplementation increased in female mice offspring the incidence of chemically-induced mammary adenocarcinomas that were heavier, compared to control group. -- PMID:31505237
GSK-3 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that coordinates with over 40 different proteins during physiological/pathological conditions in blood cells. -- PMID:31623866
BACKGROUNDRecessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a severe form of skin fragility disorder due to mutations in COL7A1 encoding basement membrane type VII collagen (C7), the main constituent of anchoring fibrils (AFs) in skin. -- PMID:31167965
Insulin levels and HOMA-IR are positively related to plasma glucose and reciprocally to CV and M-Value in prediabetes, since the latter association is with borderline significance after adjustment for hypertension and smoking. -- PMID:31707004
The spelling process of nineteen children with STS knowledge (mean age: 10.9) with different hearing degrees, born into deaf families, is described and compared with a group of fourteen hearing children without STS knowledge (mean age: 10.9). -- PMID:31780988
resulted in over 1000-fold increased fluoride sensitivity. -- PMID:31576749
Sputum induced by the inhalation of hypertonic saline is a safe, inexpensive, less invasive, and easily repeated method and can be a valuable alternative to other invasive methods in the diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis. -- PMID:31584387
LACs carrying KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutations were characterized by elevated expression of phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (pATM) kinase and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (pATR) protein in association with a pattern of mutual exclusivity with TP53 alterations. -- PMID:31323387
Tc-99m-MIBI scintigraphy in a 52-year-old man with a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism revealed two focal areas with retention of radioactivity in the left lobe of the thyroid gland on the delayed phase of MIBI SPECT/CT but no significant focal radioactive uptake on MIBI planar images. -- PMID:31159406
In this study, we systemically investigated the messenger RNA level changes of all ABC transporter family genes in P. gingivalis while being internalized within GECs by real-time polymerase chain reaction. -- PMID:31081181
Our results indicated that serum miR-1301-3p, miR-28-5p, miR-335-5p, and B7-H3 expressions were correlated with pathological stages of CRC and metastasis and may therefore serve as novel biomarkers for CRC diagnosis and treatment. -- PMID:31424670
The PCA analysis confirmed that the growth of microbes in MARA bioassay was poorly dependent on As and metals in pore water except for a yeast Pichia anomala (No 11). -- PMID:31195229
