BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: As of December 2017, 20 diabetic ketosis (DK)/diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) cases associated with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) had been reported to the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), Singapore. -- PMID:31065934
However, the metabolic profile was able to predict with approximately 90% sensitivity and specificity whether a mother fell into the High Risk group (18.7% risk) or Low Risk group (1.7% risk). -- PMID:31086561
In addition, our results suggest that these nanoparticles can have useful applications in magnetic hyperthermia and eradication of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria in presence of an ac magnetic field. -- PMID:31017138
which enables scanning for unknown thiols in precursor ion scan mode. -- PMID:31047151
The BOCAA (Biomarkers and Outcomes in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy) study recruited 10 CAA patients over 18 months. -- PMID:31775058
At present, there is no reason to believe that empagliflozin or dapagliflozin increase the risk of either peripheral artery disease of lower limb amputations. -- PMID:31150722
Intraocular hemorrhage as an intraoperative complication was seen in two patients in group 1 and one patient in group 2. Redislocation in three patients in group 2 and cystoid macular edema in one patient in each groups were observed. -- PMID:31722807
