Fine air pollution particles induce endothelial senescence via redox-sensitive activation of local angiotensin system. -- PMID:31158660
We developed and annotated blood transcriptomes from six reptile species and found on average 25,000 proteins are being transcribed in the blood, and there is a CORE group of 9,282 orthogroups that are found in at least four of six species. -- PMID:31660689
The presence of HCl induced ion-pair interactions involving chloride ions, adsorbed on gold surfaces, and both the nitrogen N1 of the pteridine ring and the γ-carboxylic acid of the glutamic acid moiety. -- PMID:31255863
The advent of anchored multiplex PCR/targeted RNA next-generation sequencing (AMP/RNA-seq) has allowed for the development of scalable platforms that can simultaneously examine multiple fusion transcripts without prior knowledge of specific fusion partners.In this study, we assess the utility of a FusionPlex sarcoma panel analysis by AMP/RNA-seq to detect disease-defining gene fusions in 16 cases of undifferentiated round cell sarcoma in which prior diagnostic work-up could not establish a definitive diagnosis. -- PMID:31033080
The corresponding evolution of the distributions of liquid in the different parts of the sample also provides key information for the prediction of ion or particle transport and accumulation in the different parts of a composite system. -- PMID:31123876
Treatment of malignant testicular cancer is primarily combined surgery with various chemical drugs. -- PMID:31002349
6-Shogaol Suppresses 2-Amino-1-Methyl-6-Phenylimidazo [4,5-b] Pyridine (PhIP)-Induced Human 786-O Renal Cell Carcinoma Osteoclastogenic Activity and Metastatic Potential. -- PMID:31569368
Long noncoding RNA 91H overexpression contributes to the growth and metastasis of HCC by epigenetically positively regulating IGF2 expression. -- PMID:31724285
This findings provide a basis for understanding the role of HPA axis in depression, especially its regulation by NR3C1 DNA methylation. -- PMID:31731185
There were 27,369 subjects aged 20 to 84 years with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus from 2000 to 2012 as the diabetes mellitus group and 107,705 sex- and age-matched subjects without diabetes mellitus as the nondiabetes mellitus group. -- PMID:31045823
To analyse persistence and adherence in patients with multiple sclerosis receiving first-line treatment with subcutaneous glatiramer acetate 20 mg (GA), subcutaneous interferon β1a (IFNβ1a-sc), intramuscular interferon β1a (IFNβ1a-im) and subcutaneous interferon β1b (IFNβ1b-sc) and to identify associated factors and reasons for discontinuation. -- PMID:31157091
A novel small-molecule inhibitor of trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) potentiates MEK1/2 inhibition in lung adenocarcinoma. -- PMID:31685806
ATI in macaques that initiated ART during early SHIV-1157ipd3N4 infection was associated with mild, localized T-cell infiltrate in the brain without detectable SHIV-RNA in the brain or CSF, or elevation in CSF soluble markers of inflammation. -- PMID:31789818
Concentrations of rifampicin in pre-dose samples in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. -- PMID:31128081
In particular, the excessive and pro-apoptotic ER stress response and inhibition of autophagy, as a result of prolonged HFD exposure, were significantly corrected by APS administration, indicating a switch of the cellular fate in favor of cell survival. -- PMID:31137008
The intrinsic electrophilic feature for the terminal nitrogen of α-diazo-β-ketoesters/ketones has been elucidated by the intermolecular nucleophilic addition of two molecules of a dimethylsulfonium ylide. -- PMID:31609119
In this article, a kind of superhydrophobic film consisting of amorphous carbon nano-particles was synthesized on common glass by the ethanol-flame synthesis method. -- PMID:31170614
The aim of this review was to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose rituximab for patients with ITP. -- PMID:31159633
Plaque measurements were more highly associated with the densities of cagA-positive H. pylori within coronary atheromas than with the densities of gastric organisms, whereas plasma lipid changes were associated with H. pylori infection, but not cagA status. -- PMID:31490998
This study compared spectroscopy-measured levels of GABA and Glx (glutamine and glutamate complex) in visual cortex between 16 people with migraine and 16 non-headache controls, and assessed whether the concentration of these neurochemicals explains, at least partially, inter-individual variability in binocular rivalry perceptual measures. -- PMID:31291247
