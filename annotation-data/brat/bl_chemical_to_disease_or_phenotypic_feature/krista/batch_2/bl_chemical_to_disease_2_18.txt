Oxidative damage is one of the main injuries caused by ALD. -- PMID:31374322
In animals, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 are enriched at the transcription start site (TSS) and function as epigenetic marks that regulate gene transcription, but their functions in plants have not been fully characterized. -- PMID:31266517
Low-Dose Pioglitazone does not Increase ROS Production in Chronic Granulomatous Disease Patients with Severe Infection. -- PMID:31745699
-exendin-4, a potential GLP-1R targeted PET tracer for the detection of insulinoma. -- PMID:31450071

Patients fed by enteral route via PEG presented lower caries scores (DMFT: PEG: 1.09, non-PEG: 2.81) and higher percentages of supragingival dental calculus than the oral feeding group (PEG: 86%, non-PEG: 57.6%). -- PMID:31697430
The combination of pexidartinib and binimetinib was safe and tolerable and demonstrated encouraging signs of efficacy in two patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) refractory to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).Molecular profiling of GISTs at diagnosis and upon progression may provide insight into the mechanisms of response or resistance to targeted therapies.Additional trials are needed to further explore combined KIT and MEK inhibition in treatment-naïve and TKI-refractory patients with advanced GIST. -- PMID:31213500
