We present a case of a 63-year-old man with a 3-year history of progressive pustular folliculitis with inflammatory patches and central scarring alopecia on both forearms and a circumscribed patch on his right lower leg. -- PMID:31621894
Though multiple genetic groups could be identified in phylogenetic trees (AnLuc, KarMa, RiPar virus 1, and Spanish group 1 and 2), all the sequences from Portugal and Spain shared common ancestry with other viral sequence obtained from samples collected over a large geographic coverage. -- PMID:31078467
Carfilzomib exhibits a much lower neurotoxicity profile, with a significantly lower incidence of PN compared to BTZ. -- PMID:31647153
Our results indicate that STAT5A-dependent FABP5 expression plays a carcinogenic role in the tumorigenesis of gastric cancer cells via reprogramming intracellular fatty acid metabolism, which establishes a new mechanism for the tumorigenesis of gastric cancer cells. -- PMID:31646566
Inter-ion and intra-ion isotope fractionations counteractively influenced the measured chlorine/bromine isotope ratios of individual dehalogenation product ions, whereas only the former could affect (enhance) the measured isotope ratios of molecular ions. -- PMID:31208793
One in the control group and nobody in the yoga group was diagnosed with pneumonia. -- PMID:31387629
Levetiracetam is effective in the treatment of children with epilepsy. -- PMID:31362674
Comparison of analgesic effect, knee joint function recovery, and safety profiles between pre-operative and post-operative administrations of meloxicam in knee osteoarthritis patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty. -- PMID:31732867
Particulate Matter 2.5 Mediates Cutaneous Cellular Injury by Inducing Mitochondria-Associated Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress: Protective Effects of Ginsenoside Rb1. -- PMID:31505827
After the DNBS challenge, mice treated with LL-PAP presented less severe colitis compared with PBS and LL-empty-treated mice groups. -- PMID:31325218
Dengue virus envelope protein domain III induces pro-inflammatory signature and triggers activation of inflammasome. -- PMID:31344594
Highly sensitive voltammetric immunosensor for the detection of prostate specific antigen based on silver nanoprobe assisted graphene oxide modified screen printed carbon electrode. -- PMID:31816713
Salvianolic acid A & B: potential cytotoxic polyphenols in battle against cancer via targeting multiple signaling pathways. -- PMID:31592132
silencing by promoter methylation is widely reported in solid tumors as part of the complex regulation of the KEAP1/NRF2 axis, but its prognostic role remains to be addressed in lung cancer. -- PMID:31159323
In LPD + BPA group was observed a significant increase in both fat pad area (%) and in mean number of mammary epithelial cells positive for progesterone receptor (PR). -- PMID:31287222
Meanwhile, a mobile application was used to manage asthma only for children in the experimental group. -- PMID:31241192
This study screened out the potential inhibitors of the four targets in a high-efficiency and low-cost manner,and explained that Xixian Tongshuan Preparation showed an effect in the treatment of inflammatory responses caused by ischemic stroke by acting both LOX pathway and COX pathway in the metabolic pathway. -- PMID:31359726
These results suggest intrinsic differences in MOR expression related to alcohol consumption levels. -- PMID:31550484
This effort prioritises patient perspectives on suffering and healing to counter the trend of symptom-based interviews which assume biologically determined models of mental disorders. -- PMID:31550913
