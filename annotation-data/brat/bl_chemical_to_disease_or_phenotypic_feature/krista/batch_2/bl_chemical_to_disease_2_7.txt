The left- and right-handed helical conformations were induced in poly-1-based CSP upon coordination with a catalytic amount of soluble sodium and cesium tetrakis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate salts (MBArF), respectively, which are soluble in the HPLC conditions [hexane-2-propanol (95:5, v/v)]. -- PMID:31062976
Paraquat and Parkinson's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. -- PMID:31476981
Compared to the clinically used neuraminidase inhibitors, these two compounds showed better activity profiles against drug-resistant influenza A strains, as well as influenza B, and improved survival of influenza-infected mice. -- PMID:31769665
Chalcones as a basis for computer-aided drug design: innovative approaches to tackle malaria. -- PMID:31556721
MMP-2 and MMP-9 plasma levels are potential biomarkers for indeterminate and cardiac clinical forms progression in chronic Chagas disease. -- PMID:31578449
The RT-PCR and Western blotting showed increased mRNA and protein expression of TNF-α, TGF-β as well as CTGF in the retina of rabbits following penetrating ocular injury, and these factors were dramatically mitigated by ocular etanercept treatment. -- PMID:31131230
