Genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity in the PTEN hamartoma tumour syndrome.
[Preferential screening to prevent glaucoma blindness (author's transl)].
Usher syndrome is the most common form of deaf-blindness.
Fetal microcephaly.
Frontonasal dysplasia, congenital heart defect, and short stature: a further observation.
This syndrome is characterized by hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia.
Hamartoma was the most common of the benign tumors.
Retinal dystrophy and optic atrophy were present in one patient.
Of these, overweight/obesity, hyperlipidemia and hypertension were the most common.
Transient blindness and seizures in severe lupus nephritis.
Cataract was the leading cause of visual impairment and blindness, which was followed by age-related macular degeneration, corneal opacity, glaucoma, and macular scar.
Purpura hyperglobulinemia.
Disorders of other systems have included cataract, arrhythmia, alopecia, sexual dysfunction, and cognitive impairment.
Hyperargininemia commonly manifests as regression, failure to thrive, spasticity, seizures with or without microcephaly.
About 50% of the transfused patients developed hyperbilirubinemia and hypokalemia.
[Congestive heart failure and arrhythmia].
Changes in expression of DPPIV have been described in ovarian carcinoma, melanoma, endometrial adenocarcinoma, prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and in certain haematological malignancies.
In 1981, Goldberg and Shprintzen described siblings with short-segment Hirschsprung disease, cleft palate, microcephaly, mild mental retardation, short stature and distinctive facial appearance.
Irreversible final disturbances were lasting mental defects, cerebellar dysarthria, ataxia, and hydrocephalus.
There was interethnic variation in odds of blindness; age, male sex, socioeconomic status, prior diagnosis of glaucoma, hypertension, intraocular pressure, and lens opacity were associated with glaucoma blindness.
