Sp1 increases expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in hypoxic vascular endothelium.
Together, these data indicate that Bmp4 signaling suppresses tooth developmental inhibitors in the tooth mesenchyme, including Dkk2 and Osr2, and synergizes with Msx1 to activate mesenchymal odontogenic potential for tooth morphogenesis and sequential tooth formation.
TNF-alpha, IL-8 in plasma; TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, myeloperoxidase in lung; and rhCC10 in plasma, urine, bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung were analyzed.
Furthermore, FGF10 restores the population of PDX1-positive cells in organ cultures derived from Fgf10(-/-) embryos.
Both glycogenin-1 and glycogenin-2 were found to be expressed in liver, but only glycogenin-1 was identified in heart and skeletal muscle from controls.
In mouse kidney, Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 mRNA distribution was similar and high in proximal tubules and collecting ducts, which was also found for NDFIP1 proteins.
Areas that expressed Gq alpha highly included olfactory bulb (930 ng/mg of membrane protein), frontal cortex (700 ng/mg of membrane protein), parietal occipital cortex (670 ng/mg of membrane protein), caudate putamen (1,003 ng/mg of membrane protein), hippocampus (1,045 ng/mg of membrane protein), hypothalamus (790 ng/mg of membrane protein), and cerebellum (950 ng/mg of membrane protein).
This was a heart-specific phenomenon, as HIF1? protein accumulated predominantly in the myocardium of hypoxia-stressed embryos.
AGE accumulate in tissue where they cross-link with proteins, e.g., collagen, inducing tissue stiffening of blood vessels and skin.
In general, Rbm5 and Rbm10 RNA expression was higher in brain than in skin.
In murine estrous endometrium, luminal and glandular epithelium exhibited Cldn3 and Cldn7, whereas Cldn10 was only detectable in glandular epithelium.
[Clinicopathological study of serum alpha 2 H S glycoprotein].
Early growth response protein 1 (Egr-1), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), IL-6, and IL-1beta mRNA increased in the lung tissue from fetal and newborn lambs.
Hippostasin protein was localized in the prostate secretory epithelium, and western blotting showed that hippostasin was present in semen.
This review discusses the importance of the three brain water-channel proteins (AQP1, AQP4, AQP9) in brain physiology.
Hyperinsulinemia resulted in a decrease in adipose tissue FZD4, LRP5/6, TCF7L2, and AXIN2 and an increase in muscle FZD1/8, DVL1/2/3, TCF7L2, AXIN2, and MYC expression.
Fasting insulin and leptin serum levels are associated with systolic blood pressure independent of percentage body fat and body mass index.
Using focal middle cerebral artery embolization (MCAO) model, following items were observed: symptoms of neurological deficit score; infarct volume; activity of SOD, content of MDA and NO, activity of NOS of ischemic brain tissue; Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression; content of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNFalpha in serum; IL-1beta mRNA expression of ischemic brain tissue.
Adiponectin was negatively correlated with body fat, while leptin had a positively correlation.
Although the systemic capillary endothelium did not express LAT1, but did express LAT2, capillaries corresponding to the blood-brain, blood-follicle, and blood-retinal barriers demonstrated strong LAT1 immunoreactions.
