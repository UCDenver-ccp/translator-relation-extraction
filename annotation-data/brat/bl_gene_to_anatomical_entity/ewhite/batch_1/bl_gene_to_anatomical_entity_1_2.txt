We measured serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) from a blood sample.
In addition, HFD intake reduced myostatin-1a and myostatin-1b expression in white muscle and myostatin-1b expression in brain tissue.
The distribution of Abp1, ProSAP1, and ProSAP2 overlaps within the brain, and all three proteins are part of the PSD and are particularly enriched in cortex and hippocampus.
Aquaporin-5 (AQP5) can cause mucus overproduction and lower lung function.
Of 224 patients enrolled, both tissue HER2 status and serum HER2 levels were successfully determined in 212 patients and 21% (45/212) were tissue HER2-positive.
Testosterone administration to prepubertal males led to a higher body mass and greater expression of Bip, Ire1?, Atf4 and Xbp1s in the liver.
Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) protein expression is widely used in the diagnosis of lung and thyroid carcinomas.
The role of Dkk1 in bone mass regulation: correlating serum Dkk1 expression with bone mineral density.
We found well-vascularized grafted islets expressing insulin, glucagon and somatostatin onto the olfactory bulb and prefrontal cortex.
The femur from E18.5 homozygous Runx2/Cbfa1-/- embryos lacked MR signal intensity patterns including the hypertrophic cartilage, which are characteristic of the bone from the age-matched Runx2/Cbfa1+/+ embryos.
The morphology of the facial, glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves are abnormal in Spry1-/-;Spry2-/- embryos.
Although correctly initiated transcripts from the LAP gene accumulate in the six examined tissues--liver, lung, spleen, kidney, brain, and testis--LAP protein is highly enriched in liver nuclei.
Anthropometric and lipid profile characteristics, serum IGF1, serum IGFBP3 and also IGF1 and IGFBP3 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were measured in all participants before and after the intervention.
Adiponectin is a collagen-like protein expressed in adipose tissue.
Adiponectin is an exclusively adipose tissue-derived protein.
Connectin, an elastic protein of muscle.
Insulin in blood and urine.
No significant changes in TNF-alpha protein levels in lung tissue were observed.
Body weight, body composition, dietary energy and protein intake, appetite assessment, serum albumin, prealbumin, serum transferrin, and quality of life.
In contrast, HS exacerbated the systemic inflammation as measured by augmented lung MPO activity, increased lung TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels, and elevated serum IL-6 levels.
