Mst1 and mst2 are essential regulators of trophoblast differentiation and placenta morphogenesis.
Adiponectin gene expression and serum adiponectin and FABP4 levels were evaluated.
Increased serum semaphorin 3E may in part exacerbate insulin resistance and carotid atherosclerosis.
To investigate by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, the mRNA expressions of TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR9, NOD1, NOD2, and NLRP3 from gingival epithelial cells of the sulcus around healthy implants and around healthy teeth.
The present study was conducted to evaluate the expression of nesfatin-1/NUCB2 protein and NUCB2 mRNA in the canine digestive organs (esophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, rectum, liver and pancreas).
Ad4BP/SF-1 increased in parallel with the onset of the female-phase and decreased as female became male.
And fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36) protein level in liver was detected.
Uromodulin was the most abundant protein in normal urine, whereas Fanconi urine was dominated by albumin.
The protein supplement resulted in greater increases in total body mass, fat-free mass, thigh mass, muscle strength, serum IGF-1, IGF-1 mRNA, MHC I and IIa expression, and myofibrillar protein.
Although male Galgt1-/- mice are infertile, male Siat9-/- mice are fertile.
The synaptic glycoprotein neuroplastin is involved in long-term potentiation at hippocampal CA1 synapses.
Measurements included the following: serum high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) by an immunoturbidimetric assay; serum IL-6 and E-selectin and serum-, HDL2- and HDL3-SAA by ELISA procedures; serum-, HDL2- and HDL3-cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) activity by a fluorometric assay.
TNF-alpha similarly induces IL-6 and MCP-1 in fibroblasts from colorectal liver metastases and normal liver fibroblasts.
The expression of germ layer markers, such as nestin (ectoderm), desmin (mesoderm), and alpha-fetoprotein (endoderm) demonstrated that the NF-pES cells can differentiate into all three germ layers.
Aquaporin 1 (AQP1), a six-transmembrane domain protein that functions as a water channel, is present in many fluid secreting and absorbing tissues such as kidney, brain, heart, and eye.
The mChk1 protein was undetectable in heart, kidney, and skin, whereas abundant expression was observed in brain and liver in both p53(+/+) and p53(-/-) mice.
Compared with the positive control groups, the Jinshuibao and spleen aminopeptidase groups, lung function was better, and JAK1, STAT3, and p-STAT3 protein were lower and TIMP1 was higher in the Liuweibuqi group.
Western blots showed increased expression of both connexin-36 (Cx36) and connexin-43 (Cx43) in HH tissue compared with normal human mammillary body tissue.
Gap junction protein connexin43 (GJA1) in the human glaucomatous optic nerve head and retina.
Compared with the ALI model group, the expression of Claudin-5, ZO-1, and VE cadherin in the lung tissue of the KGF-2 pretreatment group increased.
