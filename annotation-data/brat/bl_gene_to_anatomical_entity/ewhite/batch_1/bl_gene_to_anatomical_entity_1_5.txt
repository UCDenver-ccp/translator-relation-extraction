Lead CpGs at PTPN6/PHB2, ANKRD11, and TNRC18 map to active enhancers in kidney cortex.
Likewise, euphol treatment also inhibited colon tissue levels and expression of IL-1?, CXCL1/KC, MCP-1, MIP-2, TNF-? and IL-6, while reducing NOS2, VEGF and Ki67 expression in colonic tissue.
Neurotrophin-3, TNF-alpha and IL-6 relations in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of ischemic stroke patients.
Nephrin is a slit diaphragm protein and its expression in the developing kidney is largely unknown.
The induction of ectodermal markers such as MAP2, TUBB III, PAX6, TH and NESTIN was observed with an inhibition of mesodermal markers such as HAND2, PITX2, GATA5, MYL4, TNNT2, COL1A1 and COL1A2.
Parvalbumin and calbindin-D28k are expressed neither in mesotheliomas nor in normal lung tissue.
Expression of NKCC1, but not NKCC2, was found in parathyroid tissue.
Concentrations of glucose, glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, and corticosterone in heart blood.
CH supplementation increased insulin-stimulated pAKT protein levels in AT, liver, and muscle after HFD.
LM lesions erased MMP13, MMP14 in serum and MMP8 in synovium.
Trunk blood was assayed for serum hemoglobin, hematocrit, total and direct bilirubin, BDNF, S100B, and tau protein levels.
The G972R variant of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) gene, body fat distribution and insulin-resistance.
Like GLUT1-4, they exhibit a tissue/cell-specific expression (GLUT6, leukocytes, brain; GLUT8, testis, blastocysts, brain, muscle, adipocytes; GLUT9, liver, kidney; GLUT10, liver, pancreas; GLUT11, heart, skeletal muscle).
Mildronate treatment increased the expression of PPAR-? in the heart tissue and PPAR-? in the heart and liver tissues.
Effect of vagal stimulation on pancreatic secretion and on blood levels of gastrin, cholecystokinin, secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and somatostatin.
RAR?1 knockdown obliterates somite boundaries, and causes loss of Myod protein in the presomitic mesoderm, but ectopic, persistent expression of Myod protein in the trunk.
Subcutaneous fat modulates insulin sensitivity in mice by regulating TNF-alpha expression in visceral fat.
Ovine tissue and serum gastrin in ostertagiasis.
IL-5 protein and mRNA levels increased both in BALF and in lung tissue.
Expression of Traf1, Traf2 and Traf6 were observed in the outer edges of the bud epithelium whereas Traf3 was strongly expressed at the tip of the bud epithelium.
