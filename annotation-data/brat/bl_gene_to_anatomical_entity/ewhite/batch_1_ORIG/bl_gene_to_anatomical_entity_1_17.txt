No residual adipose tissue was noted particularly in the head and neck, palms and soles in CGL2 caused by BSCL2 mutations.
In addition, lung expression of KC/CXCL1 and MIP-2/CXCL2/3 paralleled lung injury and neutrophil sequestration.
It can also increase the expression of Bcl-2 protein and decrease the expression of Bax protein in the liver tissues, which can protect the liver.
Promoter methylation status of APC, DAP-kinase, E-cadherin, GSTP1, hMLH1, p16, RASSF1A and RUNX3 genes, which are frequently silenced in certain human malignancies, was studied in non-neoplastic cells of the esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines, liver, pancreas, kidney and lung obtained from 38 Japanese autopsies.
This study indicates that no correlation was found between serum prolactin levels and anti-desmoglein 1 levels and serum prolactin and anti-desmoglein 3 levels.
Following IL-2 1-h infusion, rising TNF-alpha serum levels preceded the increase of serum IFN-gamma or IL-6.
BMP4 soaked beads can induce Bmp4 and Lef1 expression in explanted wild-type dental mesenchymes, but only Lef1 expression in Msx1 mutant dental mesenchyme.
The expression of Gli1 and Ptc1 was reduced in Shh -/- dermal condensates and they failed to evolve into hair follicle papillae, suggesting that the adjacent mesenchyme is a critical target for placode-derived Shh.
Significant negative correlations between serum adiponectin and male gender, body mass index and serum insulin were observed.
Height, body weight, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (%BF), blood lipid, serum leptin, insulin, adiponectin and ghrelin were measured in all samples.
IHCC tissue as well as normal liver tissue and peripheral blood were analyzed for IDH1/IDH2-mutations in our patient.
Here, we studied daily expression of canonical clock genes (Bmal1, Clock, Per2, Per3, Cry1 and Cry2) and clock-controlled gene (Npas2) in all three central tissues (hypothalamus, pineal and retina) and in peripheral tissues (liver, intestine and muscle).
The levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in liver tissue were determined with ELISA.
Tbx1Cre/+;Foxi3f/f embryos had failed invagination of the third pharyngeal pouch with greatly reduced Gcm2 and Foxn1 expression, thereby explaining the absence of thymus and parathyroid glands.
Pten/Mmac1+/- heterozygous mice exhibited neoplasms in multiple organs including the endometrium, liver, prostate, gastrointestinal tract, thyroid, and thymus.
Despite the disappearance of basolateral LIN7C in CASK-deficient intestinal crypts, this epithelium retains normal localization of LIN7A/B, EGFR and ErbB-2.
Gata2 and Gata3: novel markers for early embryonic polarity and for non-neural ectoderm in the chick embryo.
Ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding protein 50 (EBP50) is a scaffolding protein expressed in polarized epithelial cells in various organs, including the liver, kidney, and small intestine, in which it regulates the trafficking and targeting cellular proteins.
The BMP ligand Gdf6 prevents differentiation of coronal suture mesenchyme in early cranial development.
The NCX2 protein was predominantly expressed in the hippocampus, in the striatum, in the thalamus, and in the hypothalamus.
