The levels of liver tissue IL-1beta, IL-4 and IL-6 (4291.3,
Seventeen days after UUO, significant increases in collagen alpha2(I), collagen alpha1(IV), TGF-beta1 and endoglin mRNA levels were detected in L kidneys vs NL kidneys.
For this purpose, tissue bacterial count, histological assessment, serum level of IL-3, IL-10, VEGF and SDF-1? were evaluated.
The baseline expressions of ICAM-1 and IL-6 also show major regional differences, with the brain stem and the striatum showing elevated values for ICAM-1, and the septum and the brain stem producing the largest amounts of IL-6.
Western blotting of homogenates from somatosensory cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb and cerebellum was performed to obtain concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), apolipoprotein E (apoE) and synaptophysin (SYN).
Furthermore, we found that Cav-1 coimmunoprecipitated with DISC1 in brain tissue.
In this paper, we have addressed this issue by examining patterning in the spinal cord of Gli2;Gli3 double mutant embryos, and in chick embryos transfected with dominant activator forms of Gli2 and Gli3.
Expression of adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, in normal colon epithelium and colon cancer tissue.
High grade leucocyte infiltration in placenta tissues is associated with elevated levels of TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, p55, p75, IL-IRA and C-reactive protein in umbilical serum.
Nodal proteins are crucial signals for mesoderm and endoderm induction after the MBT.
Hes1 and Hes5 represent critical transducers of Notch signals in brain vascular development.
HSP73 was present in kidney, liver, and ovary whereas HSP72 was only found in kidney.
Recently a possible role for serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was suggested on the basis of reduced serum BDNF levels in male-to-female individuals.
The multidrug resistance associated proteins (MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, MRP4, MRP5, MRP6, MRP7, MRP8 and MRP9) belongs to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily (ABCC family) of transporters expressed differentially in the liver, kidney, intestine and blood-brain barrier.
The Lrg protein accumulates in brain tissue after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
In the present study, we investigated the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) in post-mortem brain tissue of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and we observed a significant increase of BDNF concentration in hippocampus and parietal cortex of AD patients, as well as a negative correlation between NT-3 levels and age in hippocampus and putamen of control subjects, and for BDNF in frontal cortex.
Adiponectin levels in breast tumor tissue increase while serum adiponectin levels decrease.
In the supramammary lymph node, VCAM-1 protein was observed on both small and large venules.
However, while Ergic2 was co-precipitated by an anti-Otoferlin antibody in protein lysates from murine brain, this specific protein interaction was not detected in cochlea.
Adiponectin concentration was negatively associated with body mass index, percentage of body fat, sum of skin folds, waist circumference, triglycerides, insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]), fasting insulin, and leptin in both men and women, and also with glucose in women.
