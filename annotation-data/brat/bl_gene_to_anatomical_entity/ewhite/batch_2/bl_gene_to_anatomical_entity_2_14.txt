Elastin and elastin-associated-protein of porcine aorta and lung.
Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is a protein that is specific to heart muscle.
and serum prolactin.
The elastin content of leg muscles represents only .061% of the total muscle protein.
After induction of EAM, HMGB1 protein levels were significantly elevated both in the heart and blood.
CCNB1 and MKI67) and mesenchymal/epithelial-related (e.g.
All 6 skin samples had Langerin(+)/CD1a(+) LCs within the epidermis.
Tubulin is the major protein component of brain tissue.
Moreover, the expression of an epiblast marker gene, NANOG, and a primitive endoderm marker gene, GATA6, remained unchanged, whereas the expression of another primitive endoderm marker gene, HNF4A, was significantly reduced in FGFR2-KD embryos.
We also compared global gene expression in eye primordia taken from e12.5 Pitx2+/+, Pitx2+/-, Pitx2-/- embryos using gene microarrays.
The pattern of Sulf1 expression in the peri-mesenchymal epithelium matched predicted locations of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling.
Adenovirus-mediated adiponectin expression augments skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in male Wistar rats.
Shh maintains dermal papilla identity and hair morphogenesis via a Noggin-Shh regulatory loop.
Normal epithelium of these locations never expressed p53, TTF-1, vimentin, and p63.
Surfactant protein SP-B counteracts inhibition of pulmonary surfactant by serum proteins.
No such effects were seen in brain capillaries from Nrf2-null mice, indicating Nrf2 dependence.
Baseline serum levels of sclerostin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase predicted bone loss.
Somatomedin/insulin-like growth factor tissue receptors.
Distribution of serum proteins and beta-trace protein within the nervous system.
Interactions between HOXD and Gli3 genes control the limb apical ectodermal ridge via Fgf10.
