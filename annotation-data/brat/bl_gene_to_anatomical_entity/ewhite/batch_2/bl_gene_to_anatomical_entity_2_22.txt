High ALT2 reactivity was detected in heart and skeletal muscle, while no ALT2 expression was found in liver or kidney.
Subcellular distribution and myristoylation of p60src protein were not altered.
Several signals emanate from the limb ectoderm and in particular from the specialized epithelium of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), including three members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family of signaling molecules, BMP2, BMP4 and BMP7.
Multiple tissue-specific requirements for the BMP antagonist Noggin in development of the mammalian craniofacial skeleton.
The defined molecules (BMP7 (or2)?+?FGF2?+?FGF8) can transform skin wound healing to organ (limb) regeneration responses.
Immunohistochemistry of vertebrae showed less ATF4 staining in Fgf2(-/-) tissue, and treatment with PTH increased ATF4 staining in Fgf2(+/+) but the increase was attenuated in Fgf2(-/-) tissue.
Relationships between serum adiponectin, apelin, leptin, resistin, visfatin levels and bone mineral density, and bone biochemical markers in post-menopausal Chinese women.
The effects of maternal age and size on the expression of ESR1, BMPR1B, and FOXL2 in the ovary, brain, and uterus showed that ESR1 expression in large females was significantly lower than that in small females in the brain, but body size did not affect ESR1 expression in the ovary.
For female, dietary MOL did not change serum estradiol and the expressions of estrogen receptor beta (ER?), Bcl2, Bax, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) in ovary.
Increased liver fat, impaired insulin clearance, and hepatic and adipose tissue insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes.
Dynamic Sox5 protein expression during cranial ganglia development.
Thus, leptin, adiponectin, and the recently identified resistin, visfatin, and apelin, all exert effects on fat, muscle, and liver cells early in life.
There were no significant differences the between male and female patients regarding age, BMI, and leptin, adiponectin, resistin, visfatin and insulin serum levels.
We identified six Dlx paralogs in the dogfish and found that three showed strong transcription in teeth and dermal denticles (Dlx3, Dlx4 and Dlx5) whereas a weak expression was detected for Dlx1 in dermal denticles and teeth, and for Dlx2 in dermal denticles.
Here we show that Runx2 expression is expanded in the tooth bud mesenchyme in Osr2(-/-) mutant mouse embryos and is partially restored in the tooth mesenchyme in Msx1(-/-)Osr2(-/-) mutants in comparison with Msx1(-/-) and wild-type embryos.
Spinal cord, motor cortex, and cerebellum were removed for RT-PCR analysis of BDNF and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) gene expression.
Its morpholino-mediated knockdown affects neural crest precursor survival, leading to reduction of neural plate border and neural crest specifier genes Msx-1, Pax7, FoxD3, and Sox10.
In addition, protein levels of FAS, SREBP-1, and phospho-ERK in liver were positively modulated by oleacein, indicating an improvement in liver insulin sensitivity.
When beads incubated in GDF11 protein were implanted into the early wing bud, GDF11   caused severe truncations of the limb that affected both the cartilage elements and the muscle.
On the molecular level, both vinculin isoforms are regulated via an intramolecular head-tail interaction, with the metavinculin tail domain having a lower affinity for the head as compared with the vinculin tail.
