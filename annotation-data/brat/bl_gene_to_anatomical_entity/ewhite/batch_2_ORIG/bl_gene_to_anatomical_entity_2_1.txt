Mucin species expressed in gallbladder epithelium are MUC3, MUC5AC, MUC5B and MUC6.
NAV1, NAV2, and NAV3 expression is detected in adult heart, kidney, and brain, respectively.
Compared with adjacent non-tumor lung tissue, lung adenocarcinoma tissue exhibited significantly higher ACOT11 and ACOT13 expression.
The analysis revealed a significant up-regulation of protein and mRNA P2X4 receptor expression in the striatum and prefrontal cortex but not in the hippocampus; P2X7 protein and mRNA receptor expression in the striatum and hippocampus, but not in the prefrontal cortex; A1 protein receptor expression in all investigated structures and A1 mRNA expression in the striatum and hippocampus; Iba1 mRNA expression in the striatum and hippocampus; and GFAP mRNA expression in the striatum and prefrontal cortex.
In the brain, dynamin-1, dynamin-2, and dynamin-3 have been well studied; however, their function in the retina remains elusive.
EGF does not induce Msx-1 and Msx-2 in dental mesenchyme.
In contralateral nonobstructed kidneys, immunoblotting also revealed significant reductions of AQP1 in the inner medulla, outer medulla, and cortex, whereas expression of AQP2, AQP3, AQP4, and p-AQP2 was unchanged.
We find that sox10 has limited ability to restore the neural crest in Tfap2-deficient embryos.
Adiponectin is decreased in synovial fluid compared to serum indicating that peripheral fat stores are major producers of adiponectin into the blood stream.
To address whether the absence of Flt1 in the trophoblast alone affects placental development, we investigated chimeric placentae comprised of Flt1lacZ/lacZ trophoblast and Flt1+/+ mesoderm, generated by tetraploid aggregation.
The finding that BDNF is contained in nearly all neurons that contain huntingtin in the normal cortex, along with the reduced expression of BDNF after QUIN injection of the striatum, shows that huntingtin may be required for BDNF production in cortex.
Arginine-induced serum insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin responses in the grafted pancreas were similar to those in normal pancreas.
Later, Bmp2, Bmp3, Bmp4, and Bmp5 were detected in the perichondrium and in the adjacent mesenchyme.
GH increases EGF binding in liver and increases urine EGF concentrations.
Maintenance of blood pressure by the renin-angiotensin system in normal man.
Both HCN2 and HCN4 proteins were found to be equally expressed in the aganglionic and ganglionic bowel in HSCR and controls.
By identifying cell descendants that once expressed Emx2 with use of the Cre knock-in mutant into the Emx2 locus and analyzing phenotypes of double mutants between Emx2 and Otx2/Otx1 and between Emx2 and Pax6, we propose that at the 3-6 somite stage, the anterior neuroectoderm develops into three primordia: midbrain, caudal forebrain, and rostral forebrain.
However, there are some differences; Sox3 activates the expression of sox2, while Sox2 does not activate expression of sox3 and sox3 is uniquely expressed throughout the ectoderm prior to neural induction suggesting a role in neural competence.
DG enhanced brain p53, p16 and p21 expression.
Then their blood was collected for various biomedical measurements of fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum insulin, and amylin.
