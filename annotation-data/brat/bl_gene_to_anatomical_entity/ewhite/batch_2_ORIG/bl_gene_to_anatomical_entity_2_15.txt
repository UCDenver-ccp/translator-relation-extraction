Glial hyaluronate-binding protein (GHAP) in optic nerve and retina.
After sacrifice, serum insulin-like growth factor -1 (IGF-1) and corticosterone, as well as nuclear factor-?B(p65), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), atrogene and MyoD in gastrocnemius and soleus were analysed.
Tryptophan could influence serum GH and IGF-1 secretion and protein abundance of the muscular AA transporter of SNAT2 in the longissimus dorsi muscle in late finishing gilts fed low-protein diets.
The main AM studied either by immunohistochemistry on lymph node sections or by flow cytometry in blood and bone marrow specimens are L-selectin, CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1), CD54 (ICAM-1), CD44 (HCAM), CD11c/CD18 (gp150/95), and CD49d/CD29 (VLA-4).
Hydrocortisone administration affected abdominal fat distribution and serum leptin and adiponectin concentrations through dysregulation of leptin and adiponectin expression.
Furthermore, epithelium coexpressing Cdx2 and Sox9 had a phenotype similar to epithelium expressing Sox9 alone.
A panel of markers were measured: serum N-terminal midfragment osteocalcin (N-MID OC); serum total osteocalcin (total OC); bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP); serum and urine C-telopeptides of type I collagen (sCL and uCL); urine N-telopeptide crosslinks of type I collagen (NTX); and deoxypyridinoline (dPyr).
The serum transferrin and ceruloplasmin levels were especially high in female adult NAR.
LRIG1 mRNA and protein are expressed in many tissues, including breast tissue.
Megalin is a low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP2) expressed in the neuroepithelium and the yolk sac of the early embryo.
Serum BMP2, serum BMP4 and serum BMP6 levels were undetectable.
Galangin suppressed DFE/DNCB-induced expression of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-31, IL-32, and interferon (IFN)-? in the ear tissue.

In the mice pretreated with Ad5-IGF-1 is able to significantly lower lung index, the protein concentration in BALF, and the concentration of IGF-1 in serum and lung homogenate is obviously increased.
T3 decreased mesenchymal expression of Hoxb-5 protein and caused progressive localization of Nkx2.1 and SP-C proteins to distal cuboidal epithelia of early abnormal saccules, evidence that T3 prematurely and abnormally advanced mesenchymal and epithelial cell differentiation.
Moreover, responses of neurobiological parameters, nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), were also evaluated in the cerebellum, hippocampus, cortex, and adrenal glands.
Purification of cathepsin D from cartilage and uterus and its action on the protein-polysaccharide complex of cartilage.
Transcription factors with good organ specificity include TTF1 (thyroid transcription factor 1; lung), CDX2 (caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2; midgut), and ISL1 (ISL LIM homeobox 1) and PAX8 (paired box 8) for the pancreas and rectum.
The surgically removed oblate Onyx cast did not contain brain tissue or vessel wall, and immunohistochemical staining against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) showed Onyx penetration into GFAP-positive cerebellar tissue.
