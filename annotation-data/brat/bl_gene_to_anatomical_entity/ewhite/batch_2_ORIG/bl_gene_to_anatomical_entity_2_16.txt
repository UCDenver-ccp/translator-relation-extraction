Individual proteins (transferrin, ceruloplasmin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, IgG, IgA and IgM) were examined in blood and synovial fluid of 11 patients with Reiter's syndrome.
Homozygote Pax3(Pax8/Pax8) embryos display phenotypes indistinguishable from Pax3-deficient mutant embryos, with neural tube closure defects, a deficit in neural crest cells in the trunk, and skeletal muscle defects including absence of long-range migratory myogenic progenitors and impaired somite development.
Effects of insulin and anti-insulin serum].
A function of lung surfactant protein SP-B.
Concomitantly, IL-6, TNF-? and MCP-1 protein levels were also increased in brain regions, liver and serum of BDL rats suggesting the involvement of blood-brain-axis in inflammatory response.
Thirty minutes after the FST, we analyzed the gene expression of Nurr1, Bdnf and Nr3c1 (genes for Nurr1, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), respectively) in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hypothalamus.
[Detection and analysis of serum osteocalcin and serum calcitonin level among different fluoride burden groups].
Dystrophin and dystrophin-like proteins in muscle and brain of normal and mdx mice.
Coimmunoprecipitation of cortical brain tissue lysates revealed an interaction between Smad7 and beta-catenin.
Changes in body weight, body composition, blood glucose, insulin, tissue and serum lipid profiles, atherogenic index, liver markers, and expression of adipogenesis-related genes such as leptin, adiponectin, FAS, PPARgamma, AMPK-1alpha and SREBP-1c, were studied in experimental rats.
Both GABABR1a and GABABR1b were expressed in the neocortex, hippocampus, dorsal thalamus, habenula, and septum, but only GABABR1a was detected in cerebellar granule cells, in caudate putamen, and most hindbrain structures.
Since arterial remodelling involves increased elastin deposition, the concentration of elastin peptides was measured in lung lymph.
Conversely, primary notochord precursors isolated prior to induction formed notochord in presence of BMP-4 protein.
Aquaporin-2 (AQP2; cortex-outer medulla), AQP3 (all regions), and UT-A1 (inner medulla) protein abundances were elevated in COX-2(-/-) at baseline and further increased after WD.
Contrary to normal epidermis, the psoriatic epithelium expressed no galectin-3 and no glycoligands for galectin-1.
Cells in all lines expressed CD13, CD68 and vimentin but lacked CD11, CD14, CD15, CD16, CD45, HLA class II and other mesenchymal and epithelial markers such as desmin, alpha-smooth muscle, myoglobin, S-100 protein, and cytokeratin.
There was a correlation between the nature of change in serum TNF-alpha levels and the nature of change in serum sICAM-1 levels or serum sE-selectin levels, though serum TNF-alpha levels did not correlate with serum sICAM-1 levels or serum sE-selectin levels.
Stressed animals showed decreased P-Erk2 and decreased ratio of P-Erk2 to total Erk2 in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, but their Erk1/2 was increased in the prefrontal cortex with no change in hippocampus.
PMP22 (peripheral myelin protein) also stabilizes the protein.
The bihormonal control by insulin and glucagon of blood ketone body level was studied.
