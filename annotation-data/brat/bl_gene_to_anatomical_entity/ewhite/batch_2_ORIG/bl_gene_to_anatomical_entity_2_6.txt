Plasma levels of adiponectin, nitric oxide, and interleukin 6; messenger RNA expression of adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) in the liver and the skeletal muscle; blood biochemical test results; and histology of the liver were analyzed.
The severity of lung injury was assessed by lung histopathology scores, the expression of TLR2 mRNA and TLR4 mRNA in lung tissue was assessed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 protein in lung tissue was measured by Western blotting, the amount of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in lung tissue was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Despite lower baseline serum BDNF protein in the WKY strain, a lack of change in serum BDNF after electroconvulsive stimulus and a lack of correlation between brain and serum BDNF protein calls into question the relevance of serum BDNF as a measure of depression and treatment response.
Growth differentiation factor-15/macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 induction after kidney and lung injury.
The expression of CaBP-9k, TRPV6, TRPV5, and NCX1 mRNA was high in fetal compared to maternal placenta, while CaBP-28k was abundant in the maternal placenta.
Beta-amyloid increases cathepsin D levels in hippocampus.
The total corrected microsomal protein content (milligrams of protein per gram of liver tissue) was estimated at 32.6 and 36.2 mg/g liver tissue in two samples, and the main identified liver P450 subfamilies were CYP1A, CYP2A, CYP2C, CYP2D, CYP2E, and CYP3A.
Levels of MyD88, p38, phosphorylated p38 (pp38), interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) in spleen tissue were detected by Western blot analysis.
Semaphorin 7A (SEMA7A) is an immunomodulating protein implicated in lung and liver fibrosis.
Somatomedin activity in sera from twelve insulin-dependent diabetics was measured by the chick embryo cartilage assay system.
In addition, TLR9 and TLR10 are expressed by the spleen and not the skin, while CARD15 is low in the spleen and high in the skin.
In the endothelium lining penile arteries, immunoreactivities for eNOS, HO-1, and HO-2 were detected.
These findings underlie a role of INSL3/RXFP2 in protein turnover, contributing to muscle wasting in male hypogonadism.
Genetic disruption of Cdc42 in Schwann cells of adult myelinated nerves resulted in myelin alterations similar to those observed in Frabin/Fgd4-deficient mice, indicating that Cdc42 and the Frabin/Fgd4-Cdc42 axis are critical for myelin homeostasis.
Specific calmodulin activity was 0.1 unit/mg protein for whole body and 3.0 units/mg protein for fat body.
Chronological immunolocalization of sclerostin and FGF23 in the mouse metaphyseal trabecular and cortical bone.
Paraffin tissue sections from tissue microarray blocks were examined with immunohistochemistry for the expression of claudin-3, claudin-7, and claudin-18.
To evaluate the roles of Panx1 and Panx3 in the skin, bone, and cochlea, we created the first Panx1/Panx3 double knock-out mouse model (dKO).
Recombinant Sox17 prevented Wnt3a from repressing myelin protein expression, and inhibition of Sox17-mediated proteasomal degradation of ?-catenin blocked myelin protein induction.
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed for CCND2, PLAB, PCSK2, HGD1, TFF3, B4GALT, LGALS3, ETS1, ADM3, and TG in 150 thyroid specimens, including 52 benign thyroid nodules (28 follicular adenoma and 24 adenomatous nodules), 52 corresponding normal thyroid tissues, 20 follicular carcinomas, 20 papillary carcinomas, and six undifferentiated carcinomas.
