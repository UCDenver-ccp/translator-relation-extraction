However, Runx3 mutant mice did not show obvious tooth phenotype or deviations of Runx1 and Runx2 expression patterns in the tooth.
The protein most frequently involved in the disease is transthyretin, a serum transport protein synthesized primarily in the liver.
The expression of hHGF protein could be monitored in quadriceps muscle, plasma and lung in Groups I and II.
The liver specimens were immunostained for TNF-alpha, TLR4, and CD14.
Serum interleukin-1 (IL-1), serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum osteocalcin, urine deoxypyridinoline (DPD) and bone calcium content were measured.
Moreover, ER?, ER?, GPER, Bcl2 and UCP2 expression decreased significantly in hippocampus in female rats following ovariectomy.
EGFR, CALM3 and SMARCD1 play roles in bone and/or fat metabolism.
Control embryos first expressed Tfap2c at the morula stage, and at this stage Tfap2c was significantly lower in the SCNT embryos.
Ephrin-B1 presents mesenchymal expression, whereas ephrin-B2 and its receptor EphB4 were expressed by the epithelium.
Ectopic Pax-3 activates MyoD and Myf-5 expression in embryonic mesoderm and neural tissue.
CD34+, CD34+/CD133+/VEGFR-2-, CD34+/CD133+/VEGFR-2+, and CD34+/CD133-/VEGFR-2+ cells were counted in 10 male patients with end-stage congestive heart failure.
Endothelial capillaries also stained positive for Kir6.1 protein.
The expression of IL-6 mRNA in inguinal fat and IL-6R,Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA in testis was detected by RT-PCR.
Activin and the Xenopus nodal related proteins 1, 2, and 4 induce muscle actin from Xenopus ectodermal explants, whereas the bone morphogenetic proteins 4 and 7 induce ectoderm to differentiate as epidermis.
Amylin evokes protein p20 phosphorylation and insulin resistance in rat skeletal muscle extensor digitorum longus.
Spin-lattice (T1) and spin-spin (T2) relaxation times for skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and bone marrow of the epiphysis of the femur were also measured in all cases.
In this respect HeLa tubulin resembled membrane-associated tubulin from brain, and neuronal cell tubulin resembled brain cytosolic tubulin.
This data suggest roles for FGF-8 and FGF-9 during initiation of tooth development, and for FGF-4 and FGF-9 during regulation of tooth shape.
The expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 in the sclera lamina cribrosa was detected using immunohistology, Western blotting, and RT-PCR technique, respectively.
More importantly, serum proteomics has revealed two new candidates (osteopontin and serum mesothelin-related protein or SMRP) potentially useful in screening individuals for MMs.
