We have also shown that under conditions of hematopoietic stress, HSCs secrete the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP)-2 and BMP-6 that drives osteoblastic differentiation from mesenchymal precursors.
Use of the antibody for immunoblot detection in mouse normal tissues revealed that the Abcg4 protein is expressed in brain, spleen, and testis.
Many of the genes in this network are associated with the innate immune system, including Serping1, Casp1, C3, Icam1, Tgfbr2, Cfi, Clu, C1qg, Aif1, and Cd74.
In the burned rats, HGF was the single-chain form in the liver and lung, whereas heterodimeric HGF was detected in the spleen and kidney.
One definite difference between MBP and MOBP is that MOBP is expressed exclusively in the CNS myelin.
In Pax3 mutant (Splotch) embryos, MyoD is activated normally in the hypaxial somite, but MyoD-expressing cells are disorganized and apoptosis is prevalent in newly formed somites, but not in the neural tube or mature somites.
The immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays was performed to detect LOXL2 protein expression.
Uterine and ovary weights, serum oestradiol and progesterone concentrations, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, mRNA expressions of oestrogen receptor, androgen receptor and progesterone receptor in uterus or ovary were measured.
Nox4 is the predominant form in the kidney, although Nox2 is also expressed.
Finally, an immunocytochemical study showed colocalization of TWIK-1 and TREK-1 proteins with the astrocytic markers GLAST and GFAP in rat hippocampal stratum radiatum.
Human liver acetylcholinesterase activity levels were also unchanged, but protein levels of the acetylcholinesterase-R and other acetylcholinesterase subunit species were increased in the cirrhotic liver.
Isoelectric point of heart NGF was about 9.5, like beta NGF.
When an electrophoretic analysis of the serum proteins was included, marked decreases in the concentrations of albumin and the alpha-globulins alpha-1-antitrypsin and haptoglobin were observed in terminal liver cirrhosis, indicating impaired liver function.
Chordin is a key developmental protein that dorsalizes early vertebrate embryonic tissues by binding to ventralizing TGF-beta-like bone morphogenetic proteins and sequestering them in latent complexes.
High-resolution immunolocalization of osteopontin and osteocalcin in bone and cartilage during endochondral ossification in the chicken tibia.
The MVDP (mouse vas deferens protein) gene encodes an aldose reductase-like protein (AKR1B7) highly expressed in vas deferens epithelium and zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex.
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (G LP-1) is an incretin with glucose-dependent insulinotropic and insulin-independent antidiabetic properties that exerts insulin-like effects on glucose metabolism in rat liver, skeletal muscle, and fat.
The serum intact-parathyroid hormone (PTH) and serum alkaline phosphatase levels were 240 pg/ml and 2483 IU/l, respectively.
After 2 h, electroencephalograms were recorded and the pathological morphology of brain tissue as well as brain cell apoptosis and caspase-3 protein levels in the brain were measured.
The role of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) in pathological angiogenesis in the retina is unknown.
