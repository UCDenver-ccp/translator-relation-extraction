TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta increase the vascular permeability, and nitric oxide reduces systemic vascular resistance.
HO-1 protein increased in cardiomyocytes and centrilobular regions in the liver.
The mouse Mtf-1 gene is essential, and Mtf-1(-/-) embryos die from liver degeneration.
The catecholaminergic neurons of the medulla (including vagal complex, ventrolateral medulla and reticular formation between them) which expressed Fos protein and projected to Acb were studied.
The highest NICN1 expression levels are found in brain, testis, liver, and kidney.
In contrast, large, morphologically intact neurons located more towards the healthy brain parenchyma displayed an increase in cytoplasmic Bcl-2 and Bcl-X proteins.
These findings suggest either that the affected kidney mainly secretes active renin, which is then converted into inactive renin in the extrarenal circulation, or that the affected kidney activates inactive renin.
MCP-1, ICAM-1, MMP-9 and oxLDL were determined in venous blood samples before, during and after clamping of the carotid artery.
[The relationship between IL-13 gene polymorphism and the levels of serum IL-13 and serum eosinophil cation protein in asthmatic children].
Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is a nuclear protein expressed during the development of thyroid, lung, and forebrain.
GLUT4 protein in muscle was approximately 45% less in GLUT4 (+/-) than in WT (+/+).
This surface ectoderm/neural tube Wnt signaling has both negative and positive functions in Gli2 and Gli3 regulation: these signals repress Gli3 in segmental plate mesoderm prior to somite formation and then promote somite formation and the somite-specific activation of Gli2 and Gli3.
Extinguished SALL1 expression and marked dysgenesis of nephron structures were observed in the rudimentary kidney tissue of SALL1-KO foetuses.
Role of the atypical cadherin Celsr3 during development of the internal capsule.
Nevertheless, no clear correlation was found between CCR4 and CCR7 expression and skin and lymph node involvement, respectively.
In a murine BMT model, we investigated the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) on cerebral endothelium after allogeneic and syngeneic transplantation.
17 biomarkers were identified for lymph node involvement: Smad4/Dpc4 and FOXC1 ranked highest.
Early exercise protects the blood-brain barrier from ischemic brain injury via the regulation of MMP-9 and occludin in rats.
Zic1 transcription factor in bone: neural developmental protein regulates mechanotransduction in osteocytes.
In this animal, Otx1 and Otx2 would have also functioned in specification of the anterior neuroectoderm at presomite stage and subsequent development of forebrain/midbrain at somite stage, while Otx5 expression would have already been specialized in epiphysis and eyes.
