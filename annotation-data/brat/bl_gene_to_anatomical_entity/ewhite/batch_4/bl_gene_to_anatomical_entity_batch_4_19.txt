After 2 weeks, bone and cartilage formation were evident histologically in IBM-BMP and FCM-BMP.
In addition, CTL induced the mRNA expression of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP-2 BMP-4 BMP-6 BMP-7 BMP-9).
The genes Wnt-7a and Lmx-1, which are expressed in dorsal limb ectoderm and mesoderm, respectively, are thought to be important regulators of dorsal limb differentiation.
Expression of neuregulin and ErbB3 and ErbB4 after a traumatic lesion in the ventral funiculus of the spinal cord and in the intact primary olfactory system.
Dermo-1 mRNA and protein expression were examined in human embryo and adult tissue sections.
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays important roles in blood pressure control and tissue disease.
The expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the brain tissue was measured using western blotting.
Moreover, [125I]bovine brain calmodulin associated with the same proteins as trypanosome calmodulin.
We measured serum SeP, FGF21 and FGF23 levels, and assessed anthropometric and cardiometabolic variables.
In serum, total protein, albumin, prealbumin, ceruloplasmin and haemoglobin were reduced; the alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta-globulins were slightly reduced in infants but not much modified in adults, whereas gamma-globulins were slightly increased in adults only.
There was a significant correlation of lipid content and insulin action in liver and particularly muscle with adiponectin levels (P < 0.01).
The urine sCD80 levels were positively correlated with the TC, urine protein and urine sCTLA4 levels, and negatively correlated with the serum albumin.
Tissue-type plasminogen activator and neuroserpin: a well-balanced act in the nervous system?
Focal adhesion kinase regulates collagen I-induced airway smooth muscle phenotype switching.
The serum levels of adiponectin, IGFBP-1, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) were measured in the fasting state.
WNT4 protein was localized in the luminal and glandular epithelium as well as in the basal lamina of the uterine mucosa.
Conclusion: Patients, who kept hemodialysis, especially those with SHPT, have a significant increase in serum FGF23 protein levels and a significant decrease in serum Klotho protein levels.
CAII protein expression was higher in the labyrinth organ in the hypoxic group.
Morpho-regulation of ectodermal organs: integument pathology and phenotypic variations in K14-Noggin engineered mice through modulation of bone morphogenic protein pathway.
Lung injury was evaluated by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) total protein, arterial blood gas analysis, lung injury score, and expression of surfactant protein and von Willebrand factor.
