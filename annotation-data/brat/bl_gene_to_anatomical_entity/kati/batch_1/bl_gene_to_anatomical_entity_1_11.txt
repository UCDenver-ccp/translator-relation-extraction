Detection of p21WAF1/Cip1 in brain metastases.
In the cortex and the outer strip of the outer medulla, NHE3 abundance was unchanged, whereas immunocytochemistry revealed markedly increased NHE3 labeling of the proximal tubule brush border, suggesting subcellular redistribution of NHE3 or differential protein-protein interaction.
Amygdala, hippocampus, limbic forebrain and pineal body contained a certain amount of arginine-vasopressin (2-20 pg/mg protein).
Chx10 and Chx10-1 are expressed in the early retinal neuroepithelium, but not in the pigment epithelium and lens.
We observed specific overexpression of the unfolded protein response (UPR) proteins Grp78, Grp94, and protein disulfide-isomerase in breast, lung, and prostate cancer DTC cell lines from the bone marrow.
From 14.5 to 18.5 dpc, the nasal respiratory epithelium expresses high levels of MDM2 RNA and protein and p21WAF1/CIP1 RNA, in both wild type and p53 null embryos.
The rat brain Sec1 is also bound to Cdk5, a neural cyclin-dependent kinase.
During differentiation, TBX3 knockdown resulted in decreased neural rosette formation and in decreased expression of neuroepithelial and neuroectoderm markers (PAX6, LHX2, FOXG1, and RAX).
Western blot analysis showed that protein levels of EAAC1, GLT-1 and GLAST glutamate transporters were not changed in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, or cerebellum after KD.
Twelve genes, including SLC25A6, EEF1G, EEF1A1, COX1, ACTA1, SLA, and ANXA2, were significantly more abundant in fat tissues than in loin muscle, liver, and pituitary gland in the SUSFLECKs.
Both serum c-reactive protein (CRP) and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) were elevated.
Msx1 and Msx2 in limb mesenchyme modulate digit number and identity.
, GFAP, AIF-1, and COX-2 level in those brain regions at multiple time points and attenuated the increased caspase-3 activity in the cerebral cortex.
Apolipoprotein M is excreted in the urine of mice with a kidney-specific megalin deficiency but not in the urine of normal mice, suggesting megalin-mediated uptake of apolipoprotein M in the tubular epithelium of normal mice.
Pair-feeding decreased serum triglyceride, insulin and leptin levels, but not serum free fatty acid levels.
Both Abcg5 and Abcg8 were expressed only in liver and intestine.
Of these transcripts, six (TNFAIP6, FCN1, CXCL10, GBP1, CXCL5 and PID1) were differentially expressed in septic patients' blood compared to healthy blood upon ex vivo LPS stimulation and were restored by IFN-?.
We measured serum adiponectin, leptin, and insulin and analyzed existing data on body weight, fat mass, and serum glucose concentration.
Circulating intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in pediatric liver recipients.
Insulin induces a transient expression of SOCS-3 in the liver, muscle, and the white adipose tissue (WAT).
