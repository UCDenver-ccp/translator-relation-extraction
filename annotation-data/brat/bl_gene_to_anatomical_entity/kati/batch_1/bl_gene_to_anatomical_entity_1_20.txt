In contrast, VEGF and VEGFR2 levels were significantly higher in the knee joint fluid of the ACLR group; furthermore, VEGF and VEGFR1 were significantly higher in the knee joint fluid than in the venous blood, whereas VEGFR2 was lower in the knee joint fluid than in the venous blood.
SOX9 protein was also detected in the developing Wolffian duct epithelium in the male mesonephros.
They acquired the definitive endoderm markers Sox17 and FoxA2.
Planar cell polarity cadherin Celsr1 regulates skin hair patterning in the mouse.
Samples for plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), serum liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), serum kidney injury marker 1, serum interleukin 18 and serum creatinine were taken at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 48?h post-contrast.
Adipophilin, CRBP-1, cytoglobin and vinculin were expressed in qHSCs in the liver, whereas cytoglobin and adipophilin were expressed in qPSCs in the pancreas.
The serum protein fetuin-A is a potent systemic inhibitor of soft tissue calcification.
Levels of protein carbonyls were moderately higher in liver tissue of APOE4 vs. APOE3 mice.
We crossed female SAFB1+/- (C57B6/129) mice with male MMTV-Wnt-1 (C57B6/SJL) mice to obtain SAFB1+/+/Wnt-1, SAFB1+/-/Wnt-1, and SAFB1+/- mice.
The IL-6 protein in lung at 48 h after brain ischemia was detected with Western blot.
Furthermore, SCR suppressed DFE/DNCB-induced expression of IL-4, IL-13, IL-17, IL-18, TSLP, and IFN-? genes in the ear tissue.
Accelerated neutrophil production was evident in the infected adults, and correlated with the appearance of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) transcripts in the liver, spleen, and lung, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) transcripts in the spleen and lung.
This study quantified CXC (CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL10) and CC (CCL2, CCL4, and CCL5) chemokines in sequential urine samples obtained from 50 patients with febrile urinary tract infections during 24 hours after diagnosis.
Cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 3/muscle LIM-domain protein (CRP3/MLP) mediates protein-protein interaction with actin filaments in the heart and is involved in muscle differentiation and vascular remodelling.
Collagen XI alpha1-deficient zebrafish embryos developed defects in craniofacial cartilage formation and in notochord morphology.
Chronic pancreatitis in humans (a) is associated with the decrease in serum leptin and insulin concentrations, (b) does not affect serum adiponectin concentration but increases serum adiponectin/leptin concentration ratio, and (c) alters the interrelationship between serum adiponectin and insulin concentrations.
The EGF related transmembrane protein preadipocyte factor 1 (Pref-1) is specifically found in the zona glomerulosa and medulla of the adult rat adrenal as well as being expressed in fetal tissue.
Regulation of male sexual development by Sry and Sox9.
Protein levels were measured 6h after the last ECS using Western blotting for FGF-2 in rhinal cortex, ELISA for BDNF and NGF in hippocampus, and NGF in frontal cortex.
NGF and NT-3 expression in the striatum is lower than in the soleus muscle, while BDNF levels are similar.
