As the limb buds appear, Lbh expression is restricted primarily to the distal ventral limb ectoderm and the apical ectodermal ridge, and overlaps in these ectodermal compartments with En1 and Fgf8 expression.
Nickel was also associated with histone octamer proteins from kidney; however, little or no nickel was associated with histone octamer proteins from liver.
In Xenopus embryos, ectopic Smurf2 expression specifically inhibits Smad1 responses and thereby affects embryonic patterning by bone morphogenetic protein signals.
Furthermore, injection of Wnt1 protein alone similarly increases blood flow and capillary density in ischemic hindlimbs, and this effect is associated with increased HGF expression in ischemic muscle.
Body weight, body fat, serum lipids (triglycerides, total cholesterol and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA)), HOMA index, n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratios, serum adiponectin, leptin, resistin and TNF-alpha, as well as adiponectin expression in adipose tissue, were measured.
Endothelial breaks are observed in a major vessel, the primary head vein (PHV), in KLF2-/-KLF4-/- embryos at E9.5.
EWSR1-NFATC2 sarcoma may present in bone or soft tissue.
[Detection of BASP1 brain protein in rat reproductive tissue].
AEA reportedly enhanced heat shock protein 72 (HSP72) and HSP25 expression in lungs to protect against lung inflammation.
GM may have inhibited PAI-1 and PAR-2, thereby indirectly inhibiting HMGB1 and reducing tissue damage in the lung.
We therefore investigated expression patterns of bile salt export pump (BSEP, ABCB11), multidrug resistance protein 3 (MDR3, ABCB4), multidrug resistance associated protein 2 (MRP2, ABCC2) and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1, ABCB1) in healthy liver tissue of a white population.
The mRNA and protein levels of LFA-1, MMP-9, Caspase-3, and Bax had all decreased, while the mRNA and protein levels of Bcl-2 were elevated in the hippocampal CA1 area of rat brain tissues treated with si-LFA-1.
Unlike chicken RAD52 and mouse RAD51, no significant difference in mouse RAD52 mRNA level was found among mouse heart, brain, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and testis.
After 9 weeks of treatment with an ethanol-containing diet, significant increases in serum ALT activity, liver to body weight ratio, liver triglycerides, CYP2E1 protein expression, and CYP2E1 activity were observed.
To measure serum leptin concentration of urban residents and investigate the relationship between serum leptin concentration and body mass index(BMI), blood lipid, insulin.
Furthermore, CPT1 itself may exist as tissue-specific isoforms being the same protein in liver and fibroblasts and a different protein in muscle.
Immunoblot analyses confirm increased levels of COX2 protein in the cortex and hippocampus.
VEGF and M-CSF levels in periodontal tissue during tooth movement.
Combined loss of both Eng2/Eng3 and Fgf8 leads to complete loss of midbrain identity, resulting in fusion of the forebrain and the hindbrain primordia.
Synapsin I is the most abundant brain phosphoprotein present in conventional synapses of the CNS.
