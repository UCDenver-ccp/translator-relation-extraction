Previously, highest Oat1 and Oat3 mRNA expression was reported in kidney and Oat2 in liver.
Thirty minutes after the FST, we analyzed the gene expression of Nurr1, Bdnf and Nr3c1 (genes for Nurr1, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), respectively) in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hypothalamus.
Osteogenin is a protein initiator of bone differentiation.
NPC1 and NPC2 protein amounts are significantly decreased in adult and aged murine kidney tissue.
The amounts of four isoforms of the catalytic subunit of type-1 protein phosphatase, PP1 alpha, PP1 gamma 1, PP1 gamma 2, and PP1 delta have been determined in extracts of various mouse tissues including brain, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, small intestine, heart, lung, spleen, thymus, and testis by Western blot analysis.
Formation of definitive endoderm was assessed using RT-PCR for gene markers of endoderm (Sox17, FOXA2 and TTF1) and lung epithelium (surfactant protein C; SPC) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; CFTR).
Dystrophin and dystrophin-like proteins in muscle and brain of normal and mdx mice.
Human cartilage expressed FOXO1 and FOXO3 but not FOXO4 proteins.
L5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) was performed in wild type (WT, C57BL/6) male and female mice and in male Tlr2-/-Tlr3-/-, Tlr4-/-, Tlr5-/-, Myd88-/-, Triflps2, Myd88/Triflps2, Tnf-/-, and Ifnar1-/- mice.
When Bmpr2/Acvr2a function is reduced in cutaneous epithelium, hair follicles undergo rapid cycles of hair generation and loss.
Cells in all lines expressed CD13, CD68 and vimentin but lacked CD11, CD14, CD15, CD16, CD45, HLA class II and other mesenchymal and epithelial markers such as desmin, alpha-smooth muscle, myoglobin, S-100 protein, and cytokeratin.
Akt, ERK1/2 protein levels, miR-126 and miR-210 expression were measured in the heart tissue.
Cathepsin K can cleave bone proteins such as Type I collagen, osteopontin, and osteonectin.
Sortilin 1 (NTR-3) is a 95-100 kDa protein normally expressed in heart, brain, placenta, skeletal muscle, spinal cord, thyroid, and testis.

We also found that EPHX1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, DSP and SLC33A1, GPNMB, NCF2, RASGRP1, LGALS3 and PTPN13, are potential modifiers in pancreas and liver, respectively.
Transcription factors with good organ specificity include TTF1 (thyroid transcription factor 1; lung), CDX2 (caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2; midgut), and ISL1 (ISL LIM homeobox 1) and PAX8 (paired box 8) for the pancreas and rectum.
