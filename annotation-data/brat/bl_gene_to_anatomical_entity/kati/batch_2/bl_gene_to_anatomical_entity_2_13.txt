The expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synapsin I, or growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) in the spinal cord and hippocampus were evaluated by Western blotting.
(TOM34, AL1A1, PADI2 and KLRBA) that were up regulated in NNK treated lung tissue.
IL-6 treatment did not change hepatic expression of the acute-phase protein haptoglobin, serum levels of insulin or insulin-like growth factor-I, or the weights of the heart, liver, kidneys, adrenals, and spleen.
Within parthenotes, the expression levels of SLC2A1, TP-1, and H6PD, and possibly AKR1B1, resemble patterns described in female embryos.
Elevated omentin-1 serum levels are correlated with BMD at the femoral neck and the serum levels of osteocalcin and osteopontin in MS patients.
