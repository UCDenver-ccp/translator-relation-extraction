Silencing of NLRP3 gene ameliorated hypertension, vascular remodeling, NLRP3 inflammasome activation and phenotype switching in the aorta of SHR.
The protein levels and gelatinase activity of MMP-9 homodimer were decreased while MMP-9/TIMP-1 complex was increased in placenta, uterus and uterine artery of RUPP vs Preg rats.
From E11.5 to E13.5, the expression of Bmpr2 was detected in cardiac atrium and epicardium of Cx43(+/+) fetal heart.
