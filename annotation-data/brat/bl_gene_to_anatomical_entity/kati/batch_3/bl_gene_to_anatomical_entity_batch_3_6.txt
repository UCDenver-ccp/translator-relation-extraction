Immunohistochemical staining of human lung tissue for alpha 1-AC showed the protein to be present within alveolar macrophages.
Additionally, apelin treatment increased mRNA expression of UCP1, a marker of peripheral energy expenditure, in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and of UCP3, a regulator of fatty acid export, in skeletal muscle.
Transplanted vasopressin neurones and central nervous system effects of vasopressin.
Hepatoprotective effect was evaluated by comparing serum bilirubin, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, proteins, alkaline phosphatase and liver histopathology.
Intranasal insulin transiently increased serum insulin levels followed by a gradual lowering of blood glucose in CON only.
The detection of bile ducts in liver biopsies by cytokeratin 7.
No differences in insulin sensitivity or serum insulin concentrations were observed between groups.
RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and type I collagen (ColI) in the kidney tissues.
Fetal heart, brain, liver, lung, and kidney expressed ALDH2 and ALDH5, while ALDH1 was present mainly in fetal liver, kidney, and lung.
Patients who received protective strategy had lower blood levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 at the end of one-lung ventilation (0.24 [0.15-0.40] vs. 0.56 [0.38-0.89]
Cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP) is measurable in human dermis.
Trp64Arg polymorphism also influenced percentage of body fat (P < 0.01) and plasma leptin level (P < 0.05).
organ (bone or cartilage) -differences were only detected for SRC-1 but not SRC-3 (p<0.05).
This study was undertaken to characterize the expression of chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CXCR3, and CX3CR1 in normal (NL) peripheral blood (PB), RA PB, and RA synovial fluid (SF).
There were also no significant differences found in IL-6 vein blood concentrations between controls and SCD, IL-8 being not detected.
In addition, the levels of endogenous CYP2E1, CYP1A2, and CYP3A proteins in liver tissue were also gradually decreased following PR treatment.
PTH induces a SOST mRNA and protein fall in secondary metaphyseal trabeculae, diaphyseal bone and in epiphyseal trabeculae.
Thus, AP gingival tissue has an elevated expression of TNF-alpha and especially its p55 receptor, suggesting that TNF-alpha may contribute to tissue degradation in periodontitis.
Elastase attacks the terminal peptides of type I collagen of tendon, cornea and skin, and also attacks the helical region of type I skin collagen.
In whole embryos, the expression of Shh mRNA and protein was seen in the ocular region, and of Ptch, Smo and Gli/Sufu system on cephalic NCCs.
