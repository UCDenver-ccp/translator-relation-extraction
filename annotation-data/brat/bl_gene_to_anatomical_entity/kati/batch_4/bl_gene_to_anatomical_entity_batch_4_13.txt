Weak expression of IL-8 (two healthy, four dry eye), ICAM-1 (four healthy, four dry eye), and ephrin A5 (one healthy, two dry eye) was observed.
Out of the seven members of TRPC, we found TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, TRPC6 mRNA and protein were selectively expressed in human NSCLC tissue.
In the epidermis of European patients, the expression of filaggrin-2, the filaggrin-related protein encoded by FLG2, is decreased.
NeP was associated with upregulation of CACNA2D1 mRNA and CaVα2δ-1 protein within peripheral nerve, dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and dorsal spinal cord, but not brain.
The regulation of aromatase and androgen receptor expression during gonad development in male and female European eel.
In chicken embryos, Pax7 is required for neural crest formation in vivo, because blocking its translation inhibits expression of the neural crest markers Slug, Sox9, Sox10 and HNK-1.
Liver function tests (serum bilirubin, SGOT, SGPT and serum alkaline phosphatase) and serum proteins (total, albumin, globulins, ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin and alpha-1 antitrypsin) were measured before beginning treatment and after three and six months of use.
Studies using mutants of Tax and SMYD3 suggested that SMYD3 dominates the subcellular localization of Tax.
No association was noticed between TNF-alpha and sE-selectin serum concentrations.
In contrast to adults, adiponectin levels in the fetus were unrelated to the degree of adiposity, blood insulin, or leptin in either control subjects or ODM.
The expression patterns of the genes Wnt7b and Wnt8b were analyzed in the brain of chick embryos, having special emphasis in the forebrain.
The role of Tbx4 and Tbx5 in limb initiation is clearly established.
In IgA kidney tissue, the expression of somatostatin receptors was significantly increased with particular immmunopositive staining for sst1, sst2B, sst4, and sst5 within glomeruli.
OTX1 compensates for OTX2 requirement in regionalisation of anterior neuroectoderm.
Adiponectin action from head to toe.
The pulmonary surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-D as well as the serum collectins mannose-binding protein and CL-43 bound in a calcium-dependent manner to acapsular C. neoformans in vitro.
Hoxa9, Hoxb9, and Hoxd9 are expressed normally in adult mammary glands, suggesting a direct role for these genes in the development of mammary tissue after pregnancy.
Immunohistochemical analysis of skin samples and serum measurements of VCAM-1, VEGF, tissue factor and thrombomodulin were performed in 77 leprosy patients and 12 controls.
The levels of HBV-DNA copy number, ALT, AST in serum, the degree of inflammation, the degree of fibrosis, the mRNA expression levels of TGF-β1, Smad3, Smad7 and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and the protein expression levels of TGF-β1, CTGF and α-SMA in liver tissue were detected.
There was variability in the distribution of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin expression in pretransplant kidneys but the principal observation was a marked increase in the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 by the renal vasculature and the proximal tubules during acute rejection.
