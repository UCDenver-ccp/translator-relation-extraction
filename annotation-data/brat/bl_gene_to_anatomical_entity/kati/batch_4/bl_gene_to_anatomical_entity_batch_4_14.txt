Otx1 and Otx2 in the development and evolution of the mammalian brain.
Here, we demonstrate that both mouse Fxh and A2BP1 transcripts undergo tissue-specific alternative splicing, generating protein isoforms specific to brain and muscle.
PV-1 is expressed mostly in the lung but both the messenger RNA and the protein can be detected at lower levels also in kidney, spleen, liver, heart, muscle, and brain.
Siderocalcinosis involved collagen, elastin, reticulin, and basement membrane components in liver, lymph nodes, spleen, duodenum, and kidney.
The IL-6 and IL-10 levels in both the serum and cardiac tissue increased following aorta ligation (MC vs. SO, p < 0.001).
Comparison of GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4 mRNA and the subcellular distribution of their proteins in normal human muscle.
The metabolic profile during early lactation includes low concentrations of serum insulin, plasma glucose, and liver glycogen and high concentrations of serum glucagon, adrenaline, growth hormone, plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and non-esterified fatty acids, and liver triglyceride.
Nicorandil treatment resulted in an additional 0.5-1 elastic lamella in the aorta and decreased total protein, collagen and elastin content in the aortic wall at all ages.
[Trabecular meshwork and elastin].
The high-body-fat group displayed lower values of insulin sensitivity compared to the low-body-fat group (1/homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance 1.003+/-0.083
Androgen receptors are found in the urothelium, urinary bladder, prostate, and urethra, and testosterone could have an impact on the autonomic nervous system, bladder smooth muscle differentiation, nitric oxide synthase, phosphodiesterase-5 and Rho/Rho-kinase activities, and pelvic blood flow.
The blood level of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α, arterial morphology as well as expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and interleukin-6 in carotid wall were measured.
Neither uric Bence-Jones protein nor serum M-protein were observed.
We demonstrate that in normal muscle Ptrh2 associates in a complex with the α7β1 integrin at the sarcolemma and Ptrh2 expression is decreased in α7 integrin null muscle.
KIAA10 and TIP120B are both highly expressed in human skeletal muscle, suggesting that KIAA10 may regulate TIP120B homeostasis specifically in this tissue.
For example, in the kidney and spleen, PGE2, is the major and PGI2 and PGF2 alpha the minor products; whereas in the heart and blood vessels, PGI2 is the principal product of arachidonic acid generated in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation.
Overall, these findings suggest that JAK1 and TYK2, not JAK2 are important to specify the feather follicle primordia, and to arrange the proximal-distal axis of feather follicles, respectively, during the morphogenesis of feather follicles in embryonic chicken skin.
Additionally, insulin signalling through mammalian target of rapamycin to activate transcription and processing of SREBP1c described in liver may apply to adipose tissue.
SOCS1/CD68 and SOCS3/CD68 showed opposite trends in expression with the increased duration of the high-fat diet.
In humans, antidiabetics thiazolidinediones (TZDs) upregulate stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) gene in adipose tissue and increase plasma levels of SCD1 product palmitoleate, known to enhance muscle insulin sensitivity.
