Spectral similarities are seen between this intermediate and horse heart myoglobin Cpd II.
BRCA2 protein expression in prostate cancer tissue may have independent prognostic value.
Insulin in the central nervous system.
Changes of serum omentin levels and relationship between omentin and adiponectin concentrations in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Flip isoforms of GluR 1-3 predominated in forebrain, while flop variants of GluR 1-4 were more prevalent in the cerebellum.
Following IL-6 and IL-11 stimulation of mesenchymal adipocytes isolated from adipose tissue, IL-6 and IL-11 induced cell proliferation through the STAT3/AKT signaling pathway.
The expression of surfactant protein A (SP-A) mRNA in the lung tissue was detected by ISH.
We measured IL-6 and IL-6 soluble receptor (IL-6sR) in serum and urine of 145 transplant patients and 20 normal controls.
The expression profiles of liver TLR4 pathway related protein was confirmed by western blotting.
Western blotting was used to analyse the protein levels of PPAR-α, PPAR-γ, MCAD, LCAD, and p65 in the liver.
Metabolic parameters, insulin resistance markers and serum adiponectin levels were determined.
However, ablation of Tbx4 shortly after onset of expression in the hindlimb field, during limb bud formation, alters neither limb outgrowth nor expression of Fgf10.
A majority of adults with persistently low serum alkaline phosphatase values carry a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in the ALPL gene and also have elevated alkaline phosphatase substrate values in serum and urine.
Recent research using a mouse model of infection has indicated that specific chemokines and chemokine receptors help mediate the host response to WNV acting by at least three mechanisms: control of early neutrophil recruitment to the infection site (Cxcr2), control of monocytosis in blood (Ccr2) and control of leukocyte movement from blood to brain (Cxcr4, Cxcr3, Cxcl10 and possibly Ccr5).
CTGF protein levels were measured in serum.
The ActR-I activin receptor protein is expressed in notochord, lens placode and pituitary primordium cells in the mouse embryo.
Lipopolysaccharide and/or controlled mechanical ventilation independently decreased diaphragm contractility and fiber dimensions and increased diaphragm interleukin-6 production, protein ubiquitination, expression of Atrogin-1 and Murf-1, calpain and caspase-3 activities, autophagy, and protein oxidation.
Nestin, MAP-2, and β-tubulin were detected after neurogenesis as neural markers.
The presence of galanin in the gastric corpus tissue and its ability to affect gastric smooth muscle activity, gastrin release, and gastric acid secretion suggest potential important physiological roles for galanin in the stomach.
Despite having no influence in body weight, the HFD intake significantly increased serum lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP), nuclear factor (NF)-κB subunit p65, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, SR-A and FAS.
