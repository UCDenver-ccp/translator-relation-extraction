Since HGF-mRNA and HGF-receptor levels changed differently in liver, kidney and lung, the expression of HGF and its receptor may be independently regulated in each organ.
Leptin, adiponectin, resistin and TNF-alpha serum levels were determined.
UGT expression was also observed in other tissues: lung (Ugt1a6), brain (Ugt2b35), testis and ovary (Ugt1a6 and Ugt2b35), and nasal epithelia (Ugt2a1/2).
In this study, we report that Leptospira can be immobilized by human tropoelastin (HTE) or elastin from different tissues, including lung, skin, and blood vessels, and that Lig proteins can bind to HTE or elastin.
Contrastingly, within the hippocampus, depressed male but not female suicides displayed significant reductions of BDNF protein levels.
Significant correlations were observed between serum adiponectin and resistin levels (reciprocal, R (2) = 0.4), and between body mass index and serum leptin levels.
Resveratrol treatment on BTBR mice decreased TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, NF-?B, iNOS, and COX-2 mRNA expression levels in brain tissue.
Markers of epithelium undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition include loss of E-cadherin and cytokeratin; de novo expression of fibroblast-specific protein 1/S100A4, vimentin, and alpha-smooth muscle actin; basement membrane component loss; and production of interstitial-type matrix molecules such as fibronectin and type I/III collagen.
Fox-1/Fox-2 proteins, potent regulators of alternative splicing in the heart, skeletal muscle, and brain, repress calcitonin-specific splicing of the calcitonin/CGRP pre-mRNA.
In the epidermis, there was an increase in cellular keratin 14, keratin 10, and loricrin, as well as PGP 9.5 in innervating nerve fibers.
High serum leptin and resistin and low serum adiponectin may increase the risk for CVD among AN patients.
Plasma IGF-1, the carboxyterminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen, serum TNF, total serum protein, serum albumin, and complete blood count were determined.
Corrigendum: SREBP-2/PNPLA8 axis improves non-alcoholic fatty liver disease through activation of autophagy.
The MCP-1 protein levels peaked by 2 to 6 hours in maternal serum, liver, lung, kidney, and uterus.
On the other hand, relaxin-3-expressing nerve fibers and the relaxin-3 receptors, RXFP3 and RXFP1, are widely distributed in the forebrain, with the hypothalamus being one of the most densely-innervated regions.
Immunohistochemistry was used for detecting the expressions of PCNA, Bcl-2 and Bax proteins in oral lichen planus tissue and normal oral mucosa (NOM).
In conclusion, immunostainable renin, tissue renin content, and renin mRNA were increased in scar-adjacent tissue after 1 1/3 nephrectomy.
ALDH3 increased with age in liver and lung, although ALDH3A1 was only detectible in lung.
cerebellum and vimentin-and GFAP-reactive in 15 i.d.
Among the 10 tissue types analyzed, cynomolgus FMO1, FMO2, FMO4, and FMO6 were most abundantly expressed in kidney, while cynomolgus FMO3 and FMO5 were most abundantly expressed in liver.
