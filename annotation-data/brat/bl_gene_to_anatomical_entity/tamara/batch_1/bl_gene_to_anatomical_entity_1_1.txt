Interestingly, cells and tissues from p27 null mice, including brain, lung, and retina, present an elevated basal expression of Sox2, suggesting that p27 contributes to the repression of Sox2.
Immunohistochemical staining of endoglin, VCAM-1 and P-selectin in aortic sinus and ascending aorta was performed.
Nestin, an ectoderm marker, and Foxa2, an endoderm marker, were expressed with both methods.

Here we report the first characterization of corin protein expression in heart tissue.
Adiponectin, leptin, resistin, and visfatin, as the main circulating peptides secreted by adipose tissue, are potential contributors to bone metabolism.
The RT-PCR revealed higher levels of SUR2A, but not Kir6.1 and Kir6.2, messenger RNA in female tissue relative to male tissue, while much higher levels of both Kir6.2 and SUR2A proteins in cardiac membrane fraction in female tissue compared with male tissue were found.
FGF21 deficiency in the liver caused marked loss of FGF21 protein circulating in the blood.
