Mdm2, p53, p21 and pAKT protein pathways in benign neoplasms of the salivary gland.
Hdac4 influences cortical bone mass and thickness and knockout of Hdac4 prevents the catabolic effect of PTH in cortical bone.
Deletion of the head or tail domain of NF-M or substitution of the NF-H tail onto an NF-L subunit reveals that restoration of in vivo NF-L assembly competence requires an interaction provided by the NF-M or NF-H head domains.
The diaphragm, lung, and liver were excised and assayed for mRNA and protein expression of Ang-1, Ang-2, and Tie-2 protein and tyrosine phosphorylation.
Adiponectin and resistin in human cerebrospinal fluid and expression of adiponectin receptors in the human hypothalamus.
LAB enhanced the IFN-gamma and IL-4 responses in serum, but it had a suppressive effect on the TLR3- and TLR9-expressing CD14- APC responses in spleen and the serum IFN-alpha response induced by HRV.
This exaggerated tissue response is associated with alterations in muscle IGF-I protein and translation initiation, which would be expected to impair tissue protein synthesis.
In conclusion, leptin levels reflect total body fat mass, and although visceral fat is known to predict reduced insulin sensitivity independently, leptin did not.
Using western immunoblotting and multiplex technology, the protein levels of HSP27, HSP40, HSP60, HSP70, HSC70, and HSP90 were quantified in the liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, lung, and testes from control frogs and those that underwent medium or high dehydration (~16 or ~30% loss of total body water).
Knockdown of Slc7a7 and/or Slc7a8 in medaka embryos disrupted LR organ asymmetries.
TRPC3 protein is expressed across the lifespan in human prefrontal cortex and cerebellum.
As in insulin resistance syndromes, insulin levels were increased in pancreas and blood serum.
These changes are consistent with the hypothesis that prenatal T excess disrupts the insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissues, with liver and muscle being insulin resistant and adipose tissue insulin sensitive.
Synovial tissue sections were stained for CXCL4, CXCL7, CD41, CD68 and von Willebrand factor.
The expression of hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) and hyaluronidase 2 (HYAL2) was analysed in lung tissue.
XCL1 and XCR1 in the immune system.
In brain tissue, protein expression of eEF2K and HDAC4 was abundant, whereas DAPK3 protein was less.
The animals exhibited petechial hemorrhages, DAI marked by a bead-like pattern of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) in damaged axons, and widespread upregulation of beta-APP in neurons, with regions affected including the orbitofrontal cortex (coup), corpus callosum, caudate, putamen, thalamus, cerebellum, and brainstem.
Previous endocrine studies are enlarged by the findings of normal serum somatomedin and serum prolactin.
Data obtained from immunoblot analysis showed that Fhit protein was most abundant in spleen and brain.
