Adiponectin, a protein produced exclusively in adipose tissue, occurs in serum in relatively high concentration.
Expression of Ngn1, Ngn2, Cash1, Gsh2 and Sfrp1 in the developing chick telencephalon.
In contrast, branching was not inhibited in lungs where TGF-beta2 or TGF-beta3 were restricted to the epithelium suggesting differences in the mechanism of signaling by TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2 or TGF -beta3 in lung.
Creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and leptin normalized per body fat were unchanged.
The MUKF-1 and MUKF-2 lines were female, whereas MUKF-3 was a male mESC line.
This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of CCR1, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR7 and CXCR4 in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.
Somatotropin increased carcass protein 28% but had no effect on carcass fat.
A tissue-specific expression of MUC1 and MUC4 but not MUC16 was found in human cornea and conjunctiva.
Influence of bone and soft-tissue operations on serum concentrations of growth hormone, somatomedin C and alkaline phosphatase.
In summary, this study indicates that adiponectin protein content in non-diabetic subjects remains high in abdominal subcutaneous fat, including gluteal fat, explaining the high serum adiponectin levels in these subjects.
CUX2 binding was also enriched near genes repressed by adeno-CUX2 in male liver or induced by CUX2 siRNA in female liver but not at genes induced by adeno-CUX2, indicating that CUX2 binding is preferentially associated with gene repression.
Serum TAC was positively correlated to serum leptin and adiponectin, and inversely to serum resistin concentrations.
Neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor (NGF), brain derived neurotrophin (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5) are naturally occurring molecules that regulate development of the placenta and brain.
Their daily breast milk intake and level of IGF-1, leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, protein and fat in breast milk were measured at 1, 2 and 3 months of lactation.
In adipose tissue, expression of PEMT, PCYT1A, and PTDSS2 were positively correlated and PCYT2 was negatively correlated with percent fat mass and body mass index (BMI).
Changes in FAT/CD36, UCP2, UCP3 and GLUT4 gene expression during lipid infusion in rat skeletal and heart muscle.
Adiponectin and vaspin are insulin-sensitizing proteins that are secreted from adipose tissue.
It inhibited fatty acid synthesis related proteins including FAS, FABP4, leptin, and perilipin.
Plasma galectin-3, muscle cytokines, muscle interleukin-1 beta (mIL-1?), mIL-6, mIL-8, muscle tumor necrosis factor-alpha (mTNF-?), mIL-10, and muscle myostatin were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
Thus Krt10 protein was expressed in all three tissues tested, but the expression pattern of Krt10 in primo-vascular tissue differed from those of blood and lymphatic vascular tissues, suggesting that structural and the regulatory roles of Krt10 in primo-vascular system are different from those in blood and lymphatic vessels.
