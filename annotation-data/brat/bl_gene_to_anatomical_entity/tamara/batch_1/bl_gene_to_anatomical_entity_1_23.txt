Rho1 keeps an eye on TORC1.
We examined protein distribution in various normal rat tissues and the Eker RCs by immunohistochemistry. Tsc2 protein is expressed in the mammary ducts, salivary glands, gastric glands, parathyroid, small and large intestine, ovary and uterus.
In vivo, endogenous PCSK9 regulates VLDLR protein levels in adipose tissue.
TRPV5 and TRPV6 are expressed in placenta and bone tissues during pregnancy in mice.
Mechanically, NXT activated insulin signaling pathway by increasing expression of INSR, IRS and FGF21, phosphorylation of Akt and AMPK? in the liver, INSR phosphorylation in the kidney, and FGF21 and GLUT4 expression in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.
LGR4 protein expression in the synovial membrane in the model group tissue was reduced.
Runx2 induced Tcf7 and Lef1 strongly, but Tcf7l1 and Tcf7l2 only slightly in Runx2(-/-) chondrocytes; the expressions of Tcf7 and Tcf7l2 were reduced in Runx2(-/-) cartilaginous skeletons and calvaria, and Tcf7 showed a similar expression pattern to Runx2.
Insulin decreases plasma ANGPTL3 by decreasing ANGPTL3 expression in the liver.
Regulation of prohormone convertase 2 protein expression via GPR40/FFA1 in the hypothalamus.
ProSAP2/Shank3 could be detected in the cardiovascular network, the neural tube, the pronephros, and the retina.
No associations of serum Hc, MMP-3 and MMP-9 levels in both serum and tissue with aneurysm diameter were noted.
Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulate via gradual formation from skin proteins, especially from long-lived proteins such as dermal elastin and collagen.
Overexpression of TEMs especially TEM1, TEM7, and TEM8 in colorectal tumor tissue compared to healthy tissue suggests their role in tumor blood vessels formation.
Surprisingly, PGHS-2 mRNA and protein were easily detected in normal thyroid tissue.
Insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt was decreased in the SHIP2-overexpressing fat, skeletal muscle, and liver.
Prealbumin protein in skin.
Sp1, E2F transcription factor 1). Research efforts using various animal models such as fatty liver, liver injury, and liver fibrosis contribute greatly to the elucidation of Egr1 function in the liver.
SP-A and SP-D are used as serum marker to evaluated activity of interstitial lung diseases.
We found that LPS: caused an LRP-1-dependent redistribution of ICV-injected A? from brain parenchyma to brain vasculature and decreased entry into blood; impaired peripheral clearance of IV-injected A?; inhibited reabsorption of CSF; did not significantly alter brain microvascular protein levels of LRP-1 or Pgp, or oxidative modifications to LRP-1; and downregulated LRP-1 protein levels and caused LRP-1 mislocalization in cultured brain endothelial cells.
Biochemical markers of bone formation (serum alkaline phosphatase, serum bone alkaline phosphatase and serum osteocalcin) and resorption (serum pyridinoline cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen and urine N-telopeptide of type I collagen) all decreased following treatment.
