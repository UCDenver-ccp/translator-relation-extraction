On the other hand, GLUT1 protein was suppressed in kidney and GLUT9 was induced in liver from experimental rats and LSE or allopurinol decreased GLUT9 but increased GLUT1 protein level in the liver and kidney, respectively.
Ephrin-B1 colocalized with nephrin at the late capillary loop stage of kidney development.
One of the anti-IL-4 antibodies used stained IL-4 protein associated with the basement membrane of the amnion epithelium.
In these groups, serum interleukin-6, serum insulin, blood sugar fasting, lipid profile, body mass index and insulin resistance was determined and correlated with genotypes.
Inflammation, airway mucus, airway smooth muscle, collagen, biglycan and decorin were quantified.
Surprisingly, we found neither VGLUT1-ir nor VGLUT2-ir or VGLUT3-ir in neuromuscular junctions of somitic and branchiogenic skeletal muscles.
The human cytosolic sulfotransferases that have been most studied, namely SULT1A1, SULT1A3, SULT1B1, SULT1E1 and SULT2A1, are expressed in different tissues of the body, including liver, intestine, adrenal, brain and skin.
Heart had the highest concentration of insoluble-collagen Hyp followed by lungs, kidney, liver, muscle, spleen and brain.
Protocadherin Celsr3 is crucial in axonal tract development.
We found TIP47 protein present in the intestine from chow and high-fat challenged mice; however, adipophilin protein was only present after high-fat challenges.
In normal salivary gland tissue WIF1 is expressed at a high level and HMGA2 is not expressed.
TNF alpha increased GLUT1 mRNA abundance in brain, liver, muscle and fatty tissue, and decreased liver phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) mRNA abundance.
The serum and urine KIM-1, NGAL, OPN, and MMP-9 levels were measured.
Markers for chemokines (CCL5, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL10), nerves (PGP-9.5)
NMDAR2B protein expression levels were high throughout the study in both forebrain and hippocampus.
These enriched lung-like populations expressed lung epithelial markers SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and CC10.
The kidney is the target organ of insulin with abundant insulin receptors.
There was no correlation between amount of Heinz bodies and the concentrations of blood methaemoglobin, serum haptoglobin or serum hemopexin.
PSD decreased BDNF, NGF, and GDNF levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of mice.
The mRNA expressions of SOD2, Bcl-2, NeuN, eNOS, endothelin-1 (ET-1), CD31, VE-cadherin and vascular remodeling of the hippocampus were examined.
