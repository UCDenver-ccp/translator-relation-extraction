PRICKLE1 and PRICKLE2 mRNAs were expressed together in brain, eye and testis.
The adapter protein SLy2 (SH3 protein expressed in lymphocytes 2), also named HACS1, NASH1 or SAMSN1, is expressed in hematopoietic tissues, muscle, heart, brain, lung, pancreas, endothelial cells and myelomas.
The kidneys were stained for TLR4, TLR2, and caspase-3.
Neither M-protein in the serum nor Bence Jones protein in the urine was detected.
All the vascular endothelia were CD34+/CD105+/vimentin+.
Gap junctions are comprised of connexin proteins (Cxs), of which Cx37, Cx40, Cx43, and Cx45 are expressed in vascular tissue.
Evidence for insulin degradation by muscle and fat tissue in an insulin resistant diabetic patient.
[Reduced insulin effect in subclinical fatty liver].
mRNAs of Pcdh1, Pcdh18 and Pcdh19 are also expressed in blood vessels of the cochlea.
Skp-2 protein is strongly induced by serum from undetectable levels in isolated SMCs but remains undetectable in aorta; Skp-2 mRNA is also lower in aorta.
The bladder endothelium expressed P-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, MIP-2, and MCP-1.
Inflammatory parameters, including C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate, and serum ceruloplasmin levels were analyzed in blood samples.
Osteopontin in human milk and infant formula affects infant plasma osteopontin concentrations.
After 2 hrs of reperfusion, carotid artery blood was collected for blood-gas analysis and detection of serum levels of IL-1beta, IL-8 and TNF-alpha.
The mammalian brain expresses three FABP subtypes: FABP3, FABP5, and FABP7.
In normal skin, ET-1 weakly bound to the skin, while UVB irradiation and TNF-alpha injection significantly enhanced ET-1 binding in the epidermis, pilosebaceous structures and blood vessels.
Various studies describe increased concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in brain tissue after acute brain injury.
