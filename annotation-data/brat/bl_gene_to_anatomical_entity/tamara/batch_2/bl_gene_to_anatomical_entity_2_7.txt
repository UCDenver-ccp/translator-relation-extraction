The IGF-I and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) levels in serum and the IGF-I levels in liver were similar in all groups.
Failure of endogenous gastrin release to affect serum insulin.
Our aim was to investigate whether serum and synovial-fluid (SF) concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), leptin, adiponectin, resistin or visfatin are associated with joint pain in hip and knee in end-stage osteoarthritis (OA).
Surprisingly, hepatic eIF2? inhibition also impaired insulin-stimulated muscle and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity.
CCL11 and CCL24 were highly expressed in lung tissue from 6 and up to 72 hours.
Mice overexpressing hepatic DGAT2 fed a high-fat diet develop fatty liver, but not insulin resistance, suggesting that DGAT2 induces a dissociation between fatty liver and insulin resistance.
Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was induced in both renal cortex and aorta.
The homeobox genes Emx1, Emx2, Otx1 and Otx2 are all expressed in the rostral brain of embryos at E10.
Secondary outcomes include HbA1c, insulin sensitivity, lipid levels, blood pressure, serum glutathione, adiponectin, IL-6, E-selectin, myeloperoxidase, C-reactive protein, Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4), soluble receptor for AGE (sRAGE), urinary 8-isoprostanes, faecal bacterial composition and short chain fatty acid profile.
Indeed Wnt11 expression relies on dorsal neural tube-derived Wnt1, while En1 expression depends on the presence of the ectoderm.
The primary structures of human pulmonary surfactant-associated proteins SP-A, SP-B and SP-C isolated from lung lavage of patients with alveolar proteinosis exhibit significant differences from lung surfactant proteins isolated from lungs of healthy individuals.
Among 277 subjects, body mass index, blood pressure, fasting serum insulin levels, and insulin resistance index (fasting glucose x fasting insulin/405) were determined.
We measured the levels of seven presynaptic proteins (synaptobrevin, synaptotagmin, SNAP-25, syntaxin, SV2, Rab3a, and synapsin I) by immunoblotting in postmortem tissue from four brain regions (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, caudate nucleus, and occipital cortex).
Rats were euthanized on day 21 and brain tissue was sectioned for analysis of Tph2, Htr1a, Slc6a4, Slc22a3, and Crhr2 mRNA expression throughout the brainstem dorsal and median raphe nuclei.
Cauxin is an abundant protein in feline urine.
IL-4, IL-13, IL-25, IL-33, TSLP and ezrin levels in serum were measured by ELISA at two time points -?before and 24?hours after bronchial allergen challenge.
Dietary obesity promoted the accumulation of lipocalin-2 protein in blood and arteries.
ASRGL1, SFRP4, and ECM1 localized to glandular epithelium and stroma, cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) to stroma and immune cells.
Aldosterone stimulated striatin and cav-1 immunoreactivity in both the cortex and medulla.
Heat-shock protein (hsp60, hsp70, hsp90) expression was quantified by Western blotting in muscle, liver and gill, and transcription of four cytokines (TGF-beta, IL-1beta, IGF-1, Mx-protein) was measured by real-time TaqMan PCR in anterior kidney and spleen.
