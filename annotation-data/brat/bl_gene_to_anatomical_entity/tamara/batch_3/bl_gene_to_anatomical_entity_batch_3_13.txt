In wild-type limb buds, Hand2 is part of the protein complexes containing Hoxd13, another essential regulator of Shh activation in limb buds.
Delineating the HMGB1 and HMGB2 interactome in prostate and ovary epithelial cells and its relationship with cancer.
Concentrations of bone turnover markers (serum bone alkaline phosphatase, serum osteocalcin, serum type I collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide and urinary deoxypryridinoline) and lumbar spine BMD (LsBMD) were also measured.
MsrB2 was noted in the spiral ganglion, tectorial membrane and stria vascularis.
Also serum adiponectin, resistin, and retinol binding protein-4 concentrations were different in athletes than in controls.
Nutritional assessment included the evaluation of body mass index (BMI), body fat (FAT) and muscle mass (MM), assessed by skinfold anthropometry, serum albumin, transthyretin and retinol-binding protein, energy and protein intake.
The endocrine cytokine leptin is mainly secreted by white adipose tissue and plasma leptin levels positively correlate with body fat mass.
At the end of treatment, fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and serum free fatty acids (FFAs) were measured.
Rats were pretreated with TLR-2 or TLR-4 short interference RNA before lung ischemia reperfusion and changes in lung vascular permeability were assessed.
The expression of HNF-6, insulin, and transcription factors that are regulated by HNF-6 in developing pancreas was compared in wild-type and Hnf6-/- embryoid bodies.
TRPM8 channels are not expressed in the liver, but TRPM8-expressing sensory afferents innervate the hepatic portal vein, suggesting a TRPM8-mediated neuronal control of liver insulin clearance.
In whole brain of chick embryos insulin receptors are highest at the end of embryonic development, while insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptors dominate in the early stages.
expression levels of DNMT1, PCNA, FGFR2, and POU5F1 mRNA compared with control embryos.
The expressions of HSP47, endothelin receptor A (ETAR) and endothelin receptor B (ETBR) significantly increased in the liver tissue of infected mice.
Purification of C-reactive protein, an acute phase protein of human serum.
Interestingly, although the overall expression of SIRT1 and DBC1 increased in tumor breast tissues, the correlation between SIRT1 and DBC1 expression was weaker in tumor tissue than in normal tissue.
In organ-cultured fetal and neonatal ovaries, DAPT reduced Notch 3 and Hey2 mRNAs, whereas DES increased Hey2 mRNA.
In addition two 46,XX SRY(+) males had the SRY protein in their gonadal tissues.
Kidney weight, protein, DNA, IGF-I and -II contents were measured.
Intracellular precursor forms of transferrin, alpha1-acid glycoprotein, and alpha 1-antitrypsin in human liver.
