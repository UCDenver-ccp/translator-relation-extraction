IL-6 did not affect serum concentrations of IL-2, IL-8, interferon-alpha, and interferon-gamma.
However, VEGF treatment increased the blood flow in bone of the distracted limb and VEGF-inhibitor treatment decreased bone blood flow.
The ratios of Cx37 protein to Cx37 mRNA in adult and embryonic kidney as well as skin were 29-303-fold larger than in lung, suggesting that Cx37 mRNA was translated at different efficiencies in kidney and skin versus lung.
Disparate effects of big ET-1 and ET-1 on renal tubule function suggest that big ET-1 might directly influence renal tubule function.
Breast milk leptin and adiponectin in relation to infant body composition up to 2 years.
The Shh/Gli2 pathway plays a critical role in tissue fibrogenesis and regeneration; Gli2 activation induces profibrogenic effects in various tissues, such as the liver and kidney.
At PND 29, soleus muscles were collected to analyse myofibrillar protein MuRF-1.
Surfactant proteins and thyroid transcription factor-1 in pulmonary and breast carcinomas.
In neonates and adults, we observed discrete p75NGFR-immunoreactivity (p75NGFR-ir) in the glomerular layer of the main olfactory bulb.
We investigated relations of serum leptin and adiponectin to serum C-reactive protein (CRP), using the INTERLIPID dataset on Japanese emigrants living in Hawaii and Japanese in Japan.
Dystrophin and utrophin: genetic analyses of their role in skeletal muscle.
His peripheral blood and cerebral spinal fluid were positive for PML-RARalpha fusion protein.
Kinetic analysis of the cooperation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp/Abcb1) and breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp/Abcg2) in limiting the brain and testis penetration of erlotinib, flavopiridol, and mitoxantrone.
CSF interleukin-6 (IL-6) in patients with CNS infection (374.24
Lung tissue expressions of endothelin-1, angiopoietin-1, and bone morphogenetic protein receptor-2 were similarly altered compared with previously observed after 3-month shunting.
TNF-alpha administration induced expression of several factors known to be critically involved in lung remodeling, such as MCP-1, IL-1beta, TGF-beta1, adhesion molecules, collagen type-I and TNF-alpha itself in the lungs of treated mice.
Tissues of adults and pools of embryos were used for catalase, glutathione-S-transferases and lactate dehydrogenase determinations.
We found that, although insulin signaling was impaired in muscle, insulin activation of IRS-1/PI3K, IRS-2/PI3K, protein kinase B, and aPKC was largely intact in liver and that rosiglitazone improved insulin signaling to aPKC in muscle by improving responsiveness to PI-3,4,5-(PO₄)₃.
ABC (ATP Binding Cassette) efflux transporters at the blood-brain barrier, P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), multidrug resistance associated protein 4 (ABCC4) and breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2), are important for protecting the brain from circulating xenobiotics.
Our results showed that p300 protein was mainly expressed in the cells expressed beta-tubulin III in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum cortex, medulla oblongata and hypothalamus.
