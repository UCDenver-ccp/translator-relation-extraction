The actions of GLP-2 are transduced by the GLP-2 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor expressed in gut endocrine cells of the stomach, small bowel, and colon.
Neither Krox20 nor Fgf3 mutant embryos, characterized by a downregulation or absence of Fgf3 in r5 and r6, display ectopic neuroblasts in the otic primordium.
Additionally, the UNO group had higher hippocampal BDNF levels and serum corticosterone levels, lower hippocampal TrkB and phospho-p44/p42 MAPK levels, and reduced neuron numbers relative to controls.
The expression of Pdx1, NF-κb, IKB genes in the pancreas and plasma TNF-α levels in T1- and T2DM; Nrf2, Glut2, COX2, and iNOS proteins in pancreatic tissue of T1DM and LPCLN2, NF-κb, IKB I in adipose tissue of T2DM reverted to normal in LXA4-treated animals.
cHA also significantly increased MMP-3 and MMP-9 expression in scar tissue.
The mean relative embryo, leg muscle and breast muscle weights of AFB1-treated groups were lower than the control group and decreased with increasing AFB1.
In addition, the domains of expression of several key transcription factors important to normal craniofacial and cardiac development including AP2, Msx2, Dlx5, and Dlx6 were reduced in Spry1;Wnt1-Cre transgenic embryos.
The cutaneous expression of both SDF-1 and CXCR4 was upregulated in the inflamed skin of K14-VEGF-A transgenic mice and in imiquimod-induced skin inflammation, with expression of CXCR4 by blood vessels and macrophages.
In those embryos, Gata4 and Nfatc1, as well as newly identified Cgnl1 and Dok4 were found to be preferentially expressed in endocardial cells, but not in yolk sac endothelial cells, while Cdh5 and Kdr were expressed in both cardiac and yolk sac endothelial cells.
Identification of spectrin and protein 4.1-like proteins in mammalian lens.
The effect of smoking on serum somatotropin, immunoreactive insulin and blood glucose levels of young adult males.
We found that the expression of Shh and Bmp2 is downregulated at E12.5 and E13.5 in the dental epithelium of the Msx1 mutant tooth germ where Bmp4 expression is significantly reduced in the dental mesenchyme.
Kallikrein-kinin and renin-angiotensin systems in rat renal lymph.
Activated recombinant forms of human MAT cleave ECM and basement membrane proteins such as fibronectin, collagen type IV, laminin, and particularly elastin, entactin, and cartilage proteoglycan aggregates.
Regression analysis revealed that CD34+, CD34+/KDR+ and CD34+/CD45- hematopoietic CPCs were associated positively with eGFR and negatively with blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine.
Both high-fat- and low-fat-fed PRR(Adi/Y) mice had elevated insulin levels.
There is increasing recognition that NTs (nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and NT3) and their receptors (high-affinity TrkA, TrkB and TrkC, and low-affinity p75NTR) are expressed in lung components including the nasal and bronchial epithelium, smooth muscle, nerves and immune cells.
Antecedent protein restriction exacerbates development of impaired insulin action after high-fat feeding.
At 24 hours, blood was collected and serum gastrin levels determined.
It is characterized by the expression of a number of skeletal muscle-specific proteins, including MyoD and muscle α-actin.
