Instead, NFAT inhibition effectively reduced IL-6, osteopontin, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, CD68 and tissue factor expression in the arterial wall and lowered plasma IL-6 in diabetic mice.
Results demonstrated that mild hypothermia suppressed apoptosis in the cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus, facilitated CIRP mRNA and protein expression in these regions, especially in the hypothalamus.
[Blood serum cholinesterase activity in diseases of the liver].
IGF-I mRNA and protein levels decrease in tissues such as liver and intestine with fasting and are restored with refeeding.
Regulation of embryonic lung vascular development by vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, Flk-1 and Flt-1.
For example, epithelially expressed Bmp4 induces Msx1 and Lef1 as well as itself in the underlying mesenchyme.
At d 42, birds fed on the protein-reduced diets had lower BUN, breast muscle weight and small intestine length, while feeding on the energy-reduced diets resulted in lower abdominal fat. 5. Upregulated myostatin mRNA expression in breast muscle and downregulation of leptin mRNA expression in abdominal fat were observed in birds fed on protein and energy-reduced diets, respectively.
The expressions of claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 in the blood-brain barrier of the ischemic brain tissue significantly declined, and retigabine notably increased the expressions of three proteins and their distributions along the microvessels.
Moderate expression was observed in kidney, heart, large intestine, testis, and lung, whereas sparse or essentially no mGSTK1 protein was detected in small intestine, brain, spleen, and skeletal muscle.
Aquaporin-2 (AQP-2) encodes the vasopressin-regulated "water channels" of the renal collecting duct and is excreted in human urine.
Serum liver enzyme and reduced glutathione, expression of P-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA in the liver were determined.
Expression of chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR2, CCR5 and CX3CR1 in neural progenitor cells isolated from the subventricular zone of the adult rat brain.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) enhances periodontal tissue regeneration.
Trp64Arg polymorphism also influenced percentage of body fat (P < 0.01) and plasma leptin level (P < 0.05).
Active matrix metalloproteinase-2 localized solely to the dermis, whereas matrix metalloproteinase-9 was consistently found in new epithelium.
CXCR4 was detected in articular cartilage.
Comparative study of brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA and protein at the cellular level suggests multiple roles in hippocampus, striatum and cortex.
We have recently identified AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in rat ovary.
While KATNA1 was expressed ubiquitously among tissues of young adult mice, KATNAL1 was highly expressed in the brain and the testis.
Propranolol also accentuated the sepsis-induced increase in both IL-6 and TNF-alpha protein in muscle.
