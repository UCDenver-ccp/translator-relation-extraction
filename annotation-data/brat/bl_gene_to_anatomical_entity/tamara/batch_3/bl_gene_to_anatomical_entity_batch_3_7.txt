Homozygous Nkx2-5 knockout mouse embryos express Msx2 ectopically throughout the myocardium, suggesting Msx2 affects conduction system development through a transcriptional cascade starting with Nkx2-5.
Combined treatment with anti-CD80 and anti-CD86 suppressed eosinophilia in the blood and the small intestine and suppressed IgE production.
In Otx2+/-; Crx-/- retinas, photoreceptor degeneration and downregulation of photoreceptor-specific genes were much more prominent than in Crx-/- retinas, suggesting that Otx2 has a role in the terminal differentiation of the photoreceptors.
This suggests that Islet1 and Pitx1 function in parallel during girdle development in hindlimbs, which is in contrast with the known requirement for Tbx5 in girdle development in forelimbs.
Serum zinc, body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum insulin, C-reactive protein (CRP) and, in a subset of 751 participants, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), were measured.
The release of IL-6 from peripheral tissues is associated with an increase in muscle protein loss in HD patients, suggesting that muscle release of IL-6 is linked to protein catabolism in these patients.
Insulin sensitivity did not correlate with subcutaneous fat, leptin, or TNFalpha.
SXR mRNA and protein are expressed in adult and fetal liver, lung, kidney, and intestine.
Elevation of serum MAGE-4 protein levels and prediction of hepatocellular carcinogenesis in patients with liver cirrhosis.
Furthermore, there was no difference in serum AVP concentration, pituitary AVP content or the number and affinity of AVP receptors in the kidney and liver at trough throughout the study period.
EsA caused proliferation and mammosphere formation inhibition of breast CSCs; induced breast CSCs apoptotic death; suppressed the growth of tumors generated from breast CSCs significantly; the expressions of stemness proteins including ALDH1A1, Sox2, and Oct4 were downregulated; proapoptotic proteins, Bax and cleaved caspase-3 were upregulated, whereas the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was reduced; IL-6/STAT3 pathway proteins including IL-6, phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr705), and STAT3 (Ser727) were downregulated significantly in EsA-treated breast CSCs and tumor tissues.
Dual immunofluorescence for tryptase and cathepsin-G demonstrated a colocalization of tryptase and cathepsin-G in skin MC secretory granules.
Cold exposure led to highly increased FGF21 serum levels in UCP1 KO mice, which were reflected in increased FGF21 gene expression in adipose tissues but not in liver and skeletal muscle.
Selective insulin action on skin, ovary, and heart in insulin-resistant states.
Splenic vein insulin sampling confirmed the spleen as the source of insulin, and histological examination showed implanted islet tissue in all cases.
Northern blot analyses showed no change in ubiquitin or PGP9.5 gene expression in hippocampus or cerebellum.
Developmental analysis of Lingo-1/Lern1 protein expression in the mouse brain: interaction of its intracellular domain with Myt1l.
Lasting Cx47 expression specifically in oligodendrocytes was detected in Cx47 single knockout and Cx32/Cx47 double knockout mice up to 12 weeks post-injection, including the corpus callosum and the internal capsule but also in more distant areas of the cerebrum and in the spinal cord.
Bmp7 knockout embryos show a marked paucity of brown fat and an almost complete absence of UCP1.
The IL-2 transgenic mice expressed human IL-2 mRNA in the thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lung, muscle and skin.
