Effect of chorionic villus sampling on serum alpha fetoprotein levels.
In muscle homogenates, increased expression of MyoD and decreased expression of myogenin and MRF4 were observed in COPD.
Northern blot analysis demonstrated that ACTN2 is expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle, but ACTN3 expression is limited to skeletal muscle.
The G protein-coupled receptor P2Y14 influences insulin release and smooth muscle function in mice.
Etoposide treatment reduced CPP32/caspase-3 activity in the liver, although it did not alter the serum TNF-alpha levels or hepatic TNFR1 mRNA expressions.
We show that Fsp1/S100A4 is expressed in the elastic and fibrocartilage, and demonstrate that the fsp1-Cre; Smad4 flox/flox mutants have normal body size, but exhibit a short ear phenotype due to the deletion of the Smad4 gene in the ear chondrocytes.
Following knockdown of FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4 in two-cell mouse embryos with or without resveratrol treatment; developmental competence of embryos and expression patterns of SIRT1, p53, p21, FASL, and CLEAVED CASPASE 3 proteins in embryos by immunofluorescence were assessed after 48 h.
The protein levels of PIAS1 in tissue were investigated.
We have successfully identified maternal-specific expression of Ube3a and its antisense counterpart (Ube3a-ATS) in brain, but not in liver.
The three markers for bone turnover event: serum total alkaline phosphatase, serum N-mid osteocalcin and type I collagen C-telopeptide, including serum calcium and were determined in 125 women in the present study.
However, endothelial cells in the palmar digital artery and vein were positive only for P2X2 and P2X3 receptor subunits.
However, only the TNF-alpha and IL-6 protein content was increased in muscle by Epi.
In normal thymus, the staining by anti-titin, anti-RyR, anti-LFA3, and anti-BB1 antibodies was weak and occurred exclusively in the medulla and perivascularly.
NPs augmented the expression of NLRP3 and caspase-1, leading to production of active caspase-1 in the lung.
At 4 weeks after SE, SRIF1-family (SSTR 2A, SSTR2B, and SSTR5) immunoreactivity was increased only in neuropil.
We measured the ability of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), interleukin-18 (IL-18), liver type fatty-acid binding protein (L-FABP), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7), to predict AKI (≥50% increase in serum creatinine from baseline).
[Immunoglobulins and transferrin in blood donors.
Heart tissue was used for analysis of activation of caspase-3 and STAT3.
During the follicular phase, in both the cervix and vagina, ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4 and EGF expression was higher in the luminal epithelium (LE) than in stromal and smooth muscle (SM) cells (P<0.05).
Shh is expressed also in the forebrain neuroepithelium (neural Shh) and the underlying notochord and prechordal plate.
