Osteosarcomas in juvenile Wwox(-/-) and lung papillary carcinoma in adult Wwox(+/-) mice occurred spontaneously.
We have determined that a functional UNC-112::GFP fusion protein colocalizes with PAT-3/beta-integrin in both adult and embryonic body wall muscle.
Changes in serum IL-6 and IL-18 levels and insulin sensitivity index were monitored throughout the study.
Leptin was measured in blood obtained from the umbilical cord vein.
Differential distribution of cubilin and megalin expression in the mouse embryo.
In addition, the ESOP-1 protein was found in the yolk sac-blood islands, the developing nervous system, and the adult reproductive system.
Further analyses identified that transferrin, not EGF or IGF-1, could simulate the effect of serum.
Objectives The renal activity index for lupus (RAIL) score was developed in children with lupus nephritis as a weighted sum of six urine biomarkers (UBMs) (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, ceruloplasmin, adiponectin, hemopexin and kidney injury molecule 1) measured in a random urine sample.
Body fat content of ob/ob was reduced by both leptin doses, whereas only 10 microg/d leptin decreased body fat in Ob/?. Fat pad weights were decreased similarly by leptin in both genotypes.
Recent studies have identified the genetic defect and the resulting loss of the protein dystrophin, and shown that dystrophin messenger RNA and protein are present in normal brain tissue.
Local bone marrow renin-angiotensin system in primitive, definitive and neoplastic haematopoiesis.
Western blotting was used to analyse the protein levels of PPAR-α, PPAR-γ, MCAD, LCAD, and p65 in the liver.
Titin and nebulin: protein rulers in muscle?
In the inner ear, the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex maintains the high concentration of K+ in the endolymph.
However, direct negative effects of insulin on bone quality are not expected since insulin is thought to be anabolic to bone.
BBs are immunonegative for TDP-43 but immunopositive for cystatin C, transferrin, peripherin and sortilin-related receptor CNS expressed 2 (SorCS2).
Using the p53 knockout mouse model, we demonstrate by Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR that Fas expression is reduced in spleen and liver from p53-/- mice compared to p53+/+ controls, while similar expression levels were observed in brain, heart, kidney, lung, skin, testis, and thymus between the two groups.
The loci included several genes with links to tooth and other organ development (KCNJ2, EDA, HOXB2, RAD51L1, IGF2BP1, HMGA2, MSRB3).
Brain tissue was assayed for interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 by ELISA.
If lung is in the differential versus head and neck, esophagus, anorectal, or genital SCC, a panel including TTF-1, napsin A and p16 may be helpful, since positive TTF-1 and/or napsin A would favor lung primary, and positive p16 would favor an extrapulmonary site.
