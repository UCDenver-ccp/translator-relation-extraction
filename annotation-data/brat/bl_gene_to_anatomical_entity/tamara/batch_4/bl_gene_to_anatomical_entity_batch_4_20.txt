The lifestyle intervention significantly improved the serum AFP level, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance and whole-body insulin sensitivity index.
To study the effects of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) plasma level on the morphology of major organs, we analyzed lung, heart, liver, kidney, bone marrow, and spleen isolated from 2-year-old growth hormone receptor knockout (GHR-KO) Laron dwarf mice (with low circulating plasma levels of IGF-1) and 6-month-old bovine growth hormone transgenic (bGHTg) mice (with high circulating plasma levels of IGF-1).
During frostbite-induced muscle regeneration, gene expression for myostatin and 4 MRF; i.e., Myf5, MyoD, myogenin and MRF4, showed contrasting responses.
The skin is a major site of MDM2 expression in mice, raising the possibility that MDM2 overexpression perturbs the normal pattern of MDM2 expression and inhibits differentiation of the epidermis.
The intracellular domain of nephrin is known to interact with another slit diaphragm protein, podocin.
Coexpression of desmosomal proteins and vimentin has been reported in a specific mesenchymal phenotype.
IL-1 beta, M-CSF, and GM-CSF were demonstrated in the stroma of intact and cultured lungs by immunostaining, results confirmed by Western blotting.
Radiosensitization of head/neck squamous cell carcinoma by adenovirus-mediated expression of the Nbs1 protein.
Sca1(+)CD29(+) and Sca1(+)CD106(+) mesenchymal SCs, CD34(+)CD105(+), CD34(+)CD90(+), and CD90(+)CD105(+) adipose SCs, as well as CD34(+)Tie2(+) endothelial progenitor cells were also located in the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis.
During preoperative Swan-Ganz catheterization blood samples were withdrawn from the pulmonary artery and capillaries for measurement of endothelin-1 (ET-1).
The fat-derived protein adiponectin is known to reverse the effects of insulin resistance and to lower blood glucose levels.
It was also found that mRNA and protein expression of filaggrin (a major structural protein in epidermis) in AD-like skin was significantly elevated by β-carotene administration.
Staphylococcus epidermidis increased the white blood cell count in the CSF, increased interleukin 6, interleukin 12p40, CCL2, and CXCL1 concentrations in plasma; increased the CCL2 concentration in the brain; and caused rapid (within 6 hours) TLR2-dependent brain activation of caspase-3 and TLR2-independent white matter injury.
The proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim is important for normal immune system homeostasis.
Importantly, the association between cord blood leptin concentrations and intrauterine growth status persisted after adjusting for adiposity, placental weight, maternal serum leptin concentrations and cord blood insulin concentrations.
The systolic blood pressure, plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma angiotensin II concentration were measured, and the protein expressions of prorenin, (pro)renin receptor, angiotensinogen, angiotensin II AT1 receptor, ERK1/2, TGF-β, p38MAPK and HSP27 in the myocardium were investigated.
Nocturnal serum IGFBP-1 increased and correlated inversely with insulin in both studies.
IL-17A negative patients demonstrated reductions post therapy in serum MMP1/TIMP4, MMP3/TIMP1 and MMP3/TIMP4 ratios and an increase in CS846 (all P < 0.05).
Including osteoprotegerin and collagen IV in a score-based blood test for liver fibrosis increases diagnostic accuracy.
Development and tissue-specific distribution of mouse small heat shock protein hsp25.
