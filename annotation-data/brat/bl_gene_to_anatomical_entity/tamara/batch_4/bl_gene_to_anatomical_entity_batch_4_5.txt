The following parameters were examined: clinicopathologic features of patients, percentage of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cell in blood and Foxp3 mRNA expression in CD4+CD25 high T cell concentration of serum cytokine.
Two targets (TLR2 and ABCC3) were further validated for protein expression by tissue microarray (TMA) based immunohistochemistry.
FGF21 expression was also significantly increased in liver and adipose tissue of Gcgr(-/-) mice.
In heart tissue, there were no significant differences between db/db and db/m mice in either ACE mRNA and protein or ACE 2 mRNA and protein.
Compartmentalization of acetylcholinesterase in the chick retina.
The cortical bone of Col1a2(+/G610C) tibias at 2-months had 3% higher tissue mineral density compared to Col1a2(+/+); Col1a2(+/G610C) vertebrae had lower cortical thickness (29%), bone area (37%) and polar moment of inertia (38%) relative to Col1a2(+/+).
The levels of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum total cholesterol, serum albumin and 24 h urine protein were recorded.
Reorganization of cholinergic terminals in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in transgenic mice carrying mutated presenilin-1 and amyloid precursor protein transgenes.
In obese subjects, exercise decreased body weight, BMI, %Fat, body fat mass, lean body mass, hs-CRP, leptin, and TNF-alpha, and increased L-scale, VO(2)max, HDL-cho, and adiponectin.
WT retinas show different levels of PAD4 expression in distinct retinal layers, with the most intense labeling in inner retinal layers, while PAD4KO mice lacked retinal PAD4.
In the present study we demonstrate that elevated PHD3, but not PHD1 or PHD2, expression is not restricted to the heart but does also occur in rat skeletal muscle and liver.
The CCN1 (CYR61) protein promotes skin growth by enhancing epithelial-mesenchymal transition during skin expansion.
Relationships between serum adiponectin, leptin concentrations and bone mineral density, and bone biochemical markers in Chinese women.
CSF IL-6 levels were significantly higher in neonates with signs of brain damage.
On semi-thin sections immunohistochemistry with bone markers osteocalcin, osteonectin, osteopontin, collagen type I and the cellular markers CD34 and CD68 was performed.
The Retinoblastoma protein p107 regulates the neural precursor pool in both the developing and adult brain.
The mRNA and the protein expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and collagen I (ColI) in kidney tissue was semi-quantitatively determined with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical staining, respectively.
Th1 cell transfer further induced expression of ICAM-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in the lung.
DDAH2 expression was approximately 150 fold greater in retinal and 70 fold greater in choroidal tissue compared to brain tissue suggesting an important tissue-specific role for DDAH2 in the retina and choroid.
Here we report that in chick and rat embryos these same blood vessels, which lie close to the neuroectoderm, express several molecules related to water and ion transport, namely AQP1, AQP4 and Kir4.1.
