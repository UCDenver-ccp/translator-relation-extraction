TGF-beta-treated microglia induce oligodendrocyte precursor cell chemotaxis through the HGF-c-Met pathway.
Furthermore, immunocytochemical staining of DMSO-induced HL-60 cells indicated that gp91(phox), p67(phox), and p47(phox) were detected only after myelocyte stages (myelocytes, metamyelocytes, band cells, and segmented cells), whereas p22(phox), p40(phox), and rac-2 were detected from the promyelocyte stage.
Immunohistochemical analysis using ULK1 and GABARAP antibodies showed that the ULK1 and the GABARAP proteins co-localized to many kind of neurons such as pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum.
Expression of early neural cell markers nestin denoting neural stem cells, NCAM specifying neural progenitors, and ?-III tubulin (TuJ) indicating post mitotic neurons escalated from day 4. Differentiation into specific neural cells astrocytes marked by GFAP, oligodendrocytes indicated by CNPase, and TH-positive dopaminergic neurons was observed during the second week of culture.
The immunophenotype of bone marrow and peripheral blood cells showed an increase of B lymphocytes (CD20+, CD21+, CD22+) and activated (CD30+) and NK cells (CD16+, CD56+).
We included immunoglobulins IgG, IgA and IgM, complement factors C3 and C4, and lymphocyte subgroups CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), CD28(+)CD4(+), and CD28(+)CD8(+) T cells, CD19(+) B cells, and CD3(-)CD16(+)CD56(+) natural killer cells (NK).
Thymic shared antigen 1 (TSA-1) is a plasma membrane protein of the Ly-6 superfamily expressed on thymocytes, thymic stromal cells, and other cells of the hematopoietic system.
IGTP was also observed to be co-localized with PCNA in astrocytes and active-caspase-3 in neurons, indicating its association with astrocyte proliferation and neuronal apoptosis after ICH.
Apelin (Apln) is expressed in coronary vascular endothelial cells including peritruncal endothelial cells.
The heightened APC activity of DN T cells reflected the lack of CD4 because the anti-CD4 mAb W3/25 promoted T-APC activity of CD4+ T cells to those levels expressed by DN T cells.
Cultures of glial cells and fibroblasts allowed and lead to the identification SERPINE2/Protease Nexin-1 (SERPINE2/PN-1).
Expression of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and monocyte/macrophage (Mo/Mo) cells, and vimentin (VIM)-positive astrocytes and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes were compared between groups.
The majority of IL-5+, IL-6+, and IL-13+ cells were also noted to be mast cells for each group.
Circulating endothelial progenitor cells were defined as CD45(-)/CD13(+)/flk-1(+)/CD117(+)/7AAD(-), Tie2-expressing monocytes as CD45(+)/CD11b(+)/Tie2(+) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells as CD45(+)/CD11b(+)/Gr1(+) cells.
Down-regulation of HOXA4, HOXA7, HOXA10, HOXA11 and MEIS1 during monocyte-macrophage differentiation in THP-1 cells.
Meanwhile, the primary trophoblast cells and decidual stromal cells (DSCs) secreted more CXCL16 and expressed higher CXCR6 compared to endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) in vitro.
Mycobacterium avium MAV2052 protein induces apoptosis in murine macrophage cells through Toll-like receptor 4.
ETO family protein Mtgr1 mediates Prdm14 functions in stem cell maintenance and primordial germ cell formation.
N8 protein expression is induced in a fibroblast cell line expressing adenoviral Ela protein, which acquired epithelial-like characteristics.
All cell lines expressed IR for the astrocytic marker, GFAP, the oligodendroglial marker, CNP, and for A2B5, a marker for O-2A progenitor cells, but were negative for the neuronal marker, microtubule associated protein-2, and the fibroblast marker, fibronectin.
