When HGF was added to the CD34+/CD45+ cells in the presence of SCF, the numbers of CD36+/CD11b- cells (very early erythroid lineage cells) and BFU-E increased.
In freshly isolated cells, expression of CD95, Bcl-2, and Bax was much more pronounced in chief cells than in parietal cells.
Dendritic cells were derived from CD34(+) cells with culture in GM-CSF, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and serum-free media or from monocytes with culture in GM-CSF, interleukin-4, and autologous serum.
Transforming growth factor beta 1 induces CXCL16 and leukemia inhibitory factor expression in osteoclasts to modulate migration of osteoblast progenitors.
CD4(+) T cells and CD14(+) monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using magnetic-activated cell sorting.
Melittin stimulated the proteolysis of ADAM10 and ADAM17 substrates in human neutrophil granulocytes, endothelial cells and murine fibroblasts.
The facet joints were assessed immunohistochemically by analyzing the number of infiltrating T cells (CD3, CD4, CD8), B cells (CD20), microvessel density (CD34), osteoblasts (CD56), bone marrow macrophages (CD68), and osteoclasts (CD68) per high-power field (hpf).
Furthermore, addition of macrophage colony-stimulating factor to the cell culture medium resulted in a threefold increase in the number of CD68(+) monocytes/macrophages.
The cells obtained expressed the EPC marker combination CD36, CD71 and glycophorin, but none of the lymphocyte, monocyte or NK markers.
Interferon-beta increases the stimulatory capacity of monocyte-derived dendritic cells to induce IL-13, IL-5 and IL-10 in autologous T-cells.
Fibroblasts expressed about the same amount of TGF-beta1 or TGF-beta2 as epithelial cells.
HTLV2-Env1 stimulated the proliferation of CD4+ T cells, whereas HTLV1-Env2 stimulated both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets.
CXCL16 and CXCR6 were intensively expressed on the synovium cells, respectively on macrophages, synoviocytes and endothelial cells and on lymphocytes, synoviocytes and endothelial cells.
Finally, Trib1-silenced macrophages failed to show MCP-1 induced chemokinesis and indicating involvement of Trib1 in controlling of macrophage migration.
Experimental fibrosis and inflammation models have demonstrated that disruption of chemokine pathways such as CCL2 (MCP-1) or its receptor CCR2, CCL5 (RANTES) or CCR1 / CCR5 and others may efficiently prevent collagen deposition, by targeting monocytes and macrophages, T-cell populations or NKT cells.
Regarding MNC subsets, monocytes, lymphocytes, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, HLA-DR, CD16+, CD25+, and CD19+ were determined.
In double-infected neurons the diffusion coefficient of labeled GluR2 at the surface of living neurons is significantly higher in GluR2/GluR3-infected neurons compared to GluR1/GluR2-infected neurons suggesting a higher mobility of GluR2/3 receptors compared to GluR1/2 receptors.
TLR4 and TLR7 proteins were particularly localized in endothelial cells on C12/PG0h, but prominent signals corresponding to TLR4 and TLR7 were detected in luteal cells at PG16h.
Dengue virus-infected fibroblasts also produced interleukin 6 (IL-6) and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulation factor (GM-CSF).
Fibrocytes are circulating, hematopoietic cells that express CD45 and Col1a1.
