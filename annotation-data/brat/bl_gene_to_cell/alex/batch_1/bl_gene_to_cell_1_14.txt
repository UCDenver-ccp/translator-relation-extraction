There is evidence that a proportion of human peripheral blood monocytes can proliferate in response to CSF-1, (also known as M-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF).
CD4+ CD45RA+ (naive) T cells were the major contributor to CD4+ T cell expansion.
Cultured human mesangial cells express Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 proteins.
Chemokine receptor expression on MBP-reactive T cells: CXCR6 is a marker of IFNgamma-producing effector cells.
Ctip2-, Satb2-, Prox1-, and GAD65-Expressing Neurons in Rat Cultures: Preponderance of Single- and Double-Positive Cells, and Cell Type-Specific Expression of Neuron-Specific Gene Family Members, Nsg-1 (NEEP21) and Nsg-2 (P19).
Western blot analyses revealed reduced levels of integral membrane protein 2B (ITM2B) and ADAM2 in sperm from Adam7-null mice, suggesting a requirement for ADAM7 in normal expression of sperm membrane proteins involved in sperm functions.
[Involvement of ERK5 and JNK in the BMP9-induced differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells into cardiomyocyte-like cells].
Both neurons and glia coexpress CXCR4 and CCR5.
LA7 cells express keratin 14 and vimentin, markers for myoepithelial cells.
A Th1 cell was defined as an interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) producing CD4+ cell, and a Th2 cell as an interleukin-4 (IL-4) producing CD4+ cell.
Scx was strongly expressed in Scx(+)/Osx(+) and Scx(+)/Osx(-) fibroblastic cells of the PDL that does not calcify; however, Scx(-)/Osx(+) osteogenic cells were dominant in the perialveolar osteogenic region.
Noggin and Wnt3a enable BMP4-dependent differentiation of telencephalic stem cells into GluR-agonist responsive neurons.
These observations elucidate a novel role for Gal3 in hepatocyte, adipocyte, and myocyte insulin resistance, suggesting that Gal3 can link inflammation to decreased insulin sensitivity.
Percentage of CD3+ CD4+ T cell and CD3-CD161a+ NK cell, ratio of CD4+/CD8+ were increased.
G-CSF administration also led to increased mobilization of CXCR4+ bone marrow cells, including RAM11+ macrophages, into infarcted areas.
Human osteoclasts were generated from CD14+ monocytes cultured with macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and RANKL.
Finally, we demonstrate that Grk2 is likewise expressed by microglial cells and Schwann cells, cell types in which CXCR7 does not act as a classical chemokine receptor.
Moreover, small interfering RNA knockdown of ENT1 in the cardiomyocyte cell line, HL-1, mimics findings in ENT1-null cardiomyocytes.
We used FACS analysis to quantify decidual leukocytes (CD45), NK cells (CD56+/CD16+ and CD56++/CD16-), antigen presenting cells (HLA-DR, DC-Sign, CD14) and T/B cells (CD8, CD4, alpha-beta-T-cell receptor, gamma-delta-T-cell receptor, CD25, CD19).
Cell surface expression of HFE protein in epithelial cells, macrophages, and monocytes.
