Double-staining revealed that HCN2-positive neurons were labeled by ChAT, indicating that these HCN2-positive cells are also cholinergic neurons.
In hepatocyte cell line, ivermectin up-regulated expression of Abcb1a, Abcb1b, Abcc2, Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, Cyp2b10; while Abcb1a, Abcb1b, Abcg2, Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, Cyp2b10 and Cyp3a11 levels were induced in intestinal cell line.
IL-5(+) Th2 cells expressed greater IL-4, IL-13, and GATA-3 relative to IL-5(-) Th2 cells.
Inhibition of p38 MAPK suppresses the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta in macrophages and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS).
CD20(+) CD27(+) CD43(lo-int) cells may represent a distinct B1 cell subset within CD27(+) B cells.
IL-10 is produced by CD4+, Tho, Th1, B lymphocytes, mast cells, eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages and keratinocytes.
Kindlin-3 is expressed in hematopoietic cells, platelets, and endothelial cells.
In testes, Zscan4 proteins were detected in spermatocytes at late pachytene/diplotene stages and in Sertoli cells.
An augmented presence of IL-5, eosinophils, neutrophils, CD68+ cells, and IL-12 was observed.
Both HIF-1? inhibition regimens attenuated medial elastin degradation, smooth muscle cell depletion, and mural angiogenesis and the accumulation of macrophages, T cells, and B cells.
Localization of wild-type and mutant neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis CLN8 proteins in non-neuronal and neuronal cells.
Inhibition of p38 MAPK decreased dose-dependently the mast cell generated TNF-alpha production as well as TNF-alpha-induced expression of P-selectin and neutrophil adhesion on endothelial cells.
Localization of a mouse sperm protein required for gamete fusion, IZUMO1, appears normal in Inpp5b-null sperm.
Rab27 acts through organelle-specific effector proteins, such as granuphilin in pancreatic beta cells and melanophilin in melanocytes.
CCR1 protein expression was restricted to monocytes, CD20-positive B cells and DC-SIGN-positive dendritic cells.
We found that HCV infects both CD14(+), CD16(+)(+) monocytic cells and CD14(+)(+), CD16(+)(+) monocytic cells but not CD14(+)(+), CD16- cells in individuals infected with HCV with or without HIV coinfection.
CXCL5 and CXCL8 were mainly produced by epithelial cells, whereas CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL3 had a high expression in blood cells.
We identified 11 homeobox genes (Dlx3, Dlx4, Emx2, Lhx2, Meis1, Pbx3, Pknox2, Pou6f1, Tshz2, Zhx1, Zhx3) that were expressed exclusively in neurons; 4 homeobox genes (Pax6, Six1, Tgif1, Zfhx3) that were expressed in all non-neuronal cell populations, with Pax6, Six1 and Tgif1 also expressed in some neuronal progenitors and precursors; 12 homeobox genes (Adnp, Cux1, Dlx5, Dlx6, Meis2, Pbx2, Pknox1, Pou2f1, Satb1, Tshz1, Tshz3, Zhx2) with expression in both neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations; and one homeobox gene (Hopx) that was exclusively expressed in the non-sensory epithelium.
Huntingtin is a cytoplasmic protein that is found in neurons and somatic cells.
HLA null cells and evaluating the frequency of KIR3DS1+/-KIR2DL5+/-, KIR3DS1+/-KIR2DS1+/-, KIR3DS1+/-KIR2DS5+/- NK cells secreting IFN-? and/or expressing CD107a.
