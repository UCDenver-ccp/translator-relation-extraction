In osteoblastic cells, several SXR responsive genes have been identified, including tsukushi, matrilin-2, CD14, and Msx2.
In vivo, the AC toxin, through its specific interaction with the CD11b/CD18 integrin, primarily targets phagocytic cells such as neutrophils and macrophages.
Upregulation of osteopontin expression via the interaction of macrophages and fibroblasts under IL-1b stimulation.
The increased RANKL expression by IL-3 induces mononuclear osteoclasts; however, it does not induce multinuclear osteoclasts.
Astrocytes secreted BDNF in a cell density-dependent way and propofol decreased BDNF secretion from astrocytes.
Paraffin embedded tissues were stained by current histochemical methods and immunohistochemically processed with a panel of antibodies against dendritic reticulum cells (DRC) (CD21, CD35), endothelial cells (QBEnd/10-CD34, CD31, Factor VIII RAg), B lymphoid cells (L26, MB2), T lymphoid cells (UCHL1, DF-T1, OPD4), monocytic cells (PGM1, KP1) and interdigitating dendritic cells (S100 protein, PGM1).
The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is found in many cells including neurons, endothelial cells and blood platelets.
pancreatic glucagon- and PP-cells, pyloric gastrin-cells, intestinal GLI-cells).
Treg are a heterogeneous population of cells, including the classical CD4+CD25+ subset expressing the transcription factor Foxp3, CD4 T cells secreting IL-10 (Tr1) or TGF-beta (Th3), but also some CD8 T cells, double negative T cells and gammadelta T cells.
The glycoprotein erythropoietin (Epo) promotes the production of red blood cells (RBCs).
Importantly, we found that the predominant expressions of TLR2 in monocyte were on CD19 B cells, and the predominant expressions of TLR4 were on CD14 monocytes/macrophages.
UCB-NK cells were induced from CD34(+) cells by stem cell factor plus IL-15.
Following granulocyte and monocyte apheresis, there was a suppressed tendency in the number of CD15+CD16- cells in patients with high bone marrow CD15+CD16- cell counts at baseline.
Furthermore, weaker immunohistochemical reactions for astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neuronal ?III-tubulin were observed.
Eventually, neurons activated caspase 3 and PUMA (p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis), hallmarks of neuronal apoptosis, and died.
However, the data show that the proportions of peripheral blood CCR5+ CD4+ and CCR3+ CD4+ T-lymphocytes and BAL CCR5+ CD4+ T-lymphocytes, but not BAL CCR3+ CD4+ T-lymphocytes, were significantly increased in TB patients.
Adoptive transfer of SJDCs, unlike NDCs, significantly increased CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells and CD4+CD25+IL-10+ T cells regulatory T-cell responses in vivo.
To analyse the function of GFAP in astrocytes, we established GFAP-expressing cell lines by transfection of mouse GFAP cDNA into mouse fibroblast L cells.
These CD14(-)CD36(+)CD61(+) nonadherent cells expressed general markers of hematopoietic and progenitor cells (CD45 and CD7) but no stem cell, T cell, B cell, NK cell, monocytes or dendritic cell markers.
Endothelial NOX4 breaks down the BBB, while neuronal NOX4 leads to neuronal autotoxicity.
