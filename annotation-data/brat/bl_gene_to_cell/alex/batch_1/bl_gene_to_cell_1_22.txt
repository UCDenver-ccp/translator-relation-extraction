IL-8 and the other CXC chemokines act preferentially on neutrophils, while the CC chemokines (MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, RANTES, MIP-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta) act on monocytes, but not neutrophils, and have additional activities toward basophil and eosinophil granulocytes, and T-lymphocytes.
Here we demonstrated that chromobox protein homolog 3 (Cbx3) is crucial for SMC differentiation from stem cells and that the chromodomain and chromoshadow domain of Cbx3 are responsible for Cbx3-induced SMC differentiation.
We will then correlate CRD scores with levels of IL-15 and the percentages of T cells, natural killer T cells, and natural killer cells expressing perforin and/or granulysin proteins.
PTHrP mRNA and protein were expressed in alveolar epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts, whereas PTH/PTHrP receptor mRNA and protein were expressed in all three cell types.
CCR3+ and MHC Class II+ dendritic cells, but not eosinophils or mast cells, co-localized within eotaxin-3+ nerve fiber bundles.
No SIRT1 or SIRT4 was found in lymphocytes.
Osteoblasts, osteoclasts, chondrocytes, fibroblasts, and vascular endothelial cells all express the Nf1 gene product, neurofibromin, and may be functionally compromised when levels are decreased or absent.
The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade promotes myoblast cell survival by stabilizing the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21WAF1 protein.
Hepatocytes contribute to soluble CD14 production, and CD14 expression is differentially regulated in hepatocytes and monocytes.
In neuronal cells, Shank2-AS and Shank2 can form a double-stranded RNA and inhibit Shank2 expression.
Cervicovaginal biopsies with and without schistosomiasis were immunostained for quantification of CD4(+) T lymphocytes (CD3, CD8), macrophages (CD68), and dendritic Langerhans cells (S100 protein).
Immunohistochemistry assigned the Stat1 protein in RA synovial tissue mainly to macrophages and T lymphocytes and the p47phox protein in particular to macrophages.
Dendritic cells were defined as the sum of CD80(+) and CD80(+)/CD14(+) cells.
Freshly isolated cells from subcortical white matter and hippocampus expressed oligodendrocyte progenitor cell markers such as A2B5, neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2), and oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (OLIG2) in ?20% of cells but no neural stem cell (NSC) markers such as CD133 (Prominin1), Nestin, SOX2, or PAX6.
In linear regression analysis, only steroid intake was a significant determinant of monocyte (subset) counts: total monocytes (? = 0.331; P < 0.001), CD14(++)CD16(-) monocytes (? = 0.374; P < 0.001), CD14(++)CD16(+) monocytes (? = 0.221; P = 0.010) and CD14(+)CD16(++) monocytes (? = -0.169;
RLN mRNA and protein expression were restricted to the Leydig cells, whereas both Leydig cells and seminiferous epithelial cells expressed RXFP1 mRNA and protein.
In COF, Notch proteins staining were showed extensively distribution in fibroblasts and osteoblasts.
HSNC clones produced various cytokines, including IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, granulocyte CSF (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), macrophage CSF (CSF-1), TGF-beta 1, and c-kit ligand, but could not produce IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, TNF-alpha, or TNF-beta.
Most of the activated glial cells expressing Flt-1 and Flk-1 were reactive astrocytes, although some were microglial cells.
Platelet-associated genes, such as thrombospondin 1, platelet glycoprotein IIIa, etc., were highly expressed in CD41(+) cells but not in CD41(-) cells and CD34(+) cells.
