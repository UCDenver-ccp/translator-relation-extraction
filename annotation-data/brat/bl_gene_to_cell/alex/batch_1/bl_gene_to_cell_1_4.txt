CD13+, CD71+; adipocytes CD10+, FIB86.3-,
First, we generated nestin+/PAX6+/SOX1+/OCT4- neural stem cells (NSCs) from HD-iPS cells using the method of embryoid body formation.
These observations suggest that Hck and Src serve partially overlapping functions in osteoclasts and that the expression of Hck in src-/- osteoclasts ameliorates their functional defects.
CXCL1, CXCL8); effects on numbers of T cells and CD11c-positive dendritic cells were more delayed.
MEKK3 is essential for lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor production in macrophages.
Using double-immunofluorescence staining, we identified that AAA stem cells express the macrophage marker CD68 but not the smooth muscle cell marker SM22 or the fibroblast marker FSP1.
Presympathetic neurons and AVP neurons in the PVN expressed RXFP1, but not relaxin.
The number of lymphocytes and monocytes and the percentage of CD3+, CD4+, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, CD62L+, CD54+ and CD54+CD16+ cells decreased, while the percentage of CD8+ cells was unaffected.
Among them are cells displaying the CD34+CXC chemokine receptor 4+collagen I+ phenotype, identifying them as fibrocytes, derived from the monocyte lineage.
Adding back Smad5 from a different source to the Smurf1-overexpressing cells restores the BMP-mediated osteoblast conversion.
Addition of recombinant Jagged-1 protein to primary cultures of hepatocytes stimulated hepatocyte DNA synthesis.
Most proliferating EGFP+ cells showed expression of the stem cell marker, Sox2, and formed clusters of two to four cells containing GFAP+/EGFP+ and GFAP-/EGFP+ cells.
Resistin induces monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion by increasing ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in endothelial cells via p38MAPK-dependent pathway.
The motor protein myosin-X transports VE-cadherin along filopodia to allow the formation of early endothelial cell-cell contacts.
The medium-sized cells were CD20+, CD79a+, Bcl2+, Bcl6+ and CD10+, enmeshed in a network of CD21-positive follicular dendritic cells.
In immature hematopoietic cells, tal-1 and GATA-1 genes are coexpressed in committed progenitors cells (CD34+/CD38(2+)), whereas they are not detectable in the most primitive cells (CD34(2+)/CD38-).
Dual-labeling studies showed that TrkA-labeled astrocytes were also immunoreactive for vimentin, a protein expressed by reactive astrocytes.
Compared with CD34+CD7- myeloblasts, CD34+CD7+ myeloblasts showed greater proliferative capacity, more active cell cycling, and less apoptosis.
In addition, nestin(+) microglia co-expressed vimentin and NG2, but not GFAP or neuronal markers.
Expression of monocyte/macrophage markers (CD13, CD14, CD68) on human keratinocytes in healthy and diseased skin.
