Our results demonstrate that the ischemic injury of neuronal cells increased cell cytoxicity and apoptosis, which were accompanied by sustained activation of the IRE1-alpha/TRAF2, JNK1/2, and p38 MAPK pathways.
Moreover, Atm-/- p21-/- primary embryonic fibroblasts exhibit increased CIN compared with either Atm-/- or p21-/- cells.
No evidence of TrkB-like protein expression in lymphocytes or follicular dendritic cells could be found.
IL-9 is a pleiotropic cytokine that affects the function of different target cells such as T cells, B cells, mast cells and airway epithelial cells by activating STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5.
MPs were measured by flow cytometry and labeled for specific cell markers of CD45 (leukocytes), CD66b (neutrophils), CD14 (monocytes), CD41a (platelets), CD51 (endothelial cells), CD3 (T lymphocyte) and CD235a (erythrocytes).
Co-culture of either BDNF over-expressing Schwann cells or Ntf3 over-expressing Schwann cells with SGNs from early postnatal rats significantly enhanced neuronal survival in comparison to both control Schwann cells and conventional recombinant neurotrophin proteins.
Numerous reports show that various cells express IL-8 mRNA and produce IL-8 protein rapidly, including monocytes, T lymphocytes, neutrophils, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and epithelial cells.
This suggests that CCL2 expressed by injured dorsal root neurons does not act as neuron-microglia signal in contrast to CCL21.
Fibroblast-like cells stained positively for alkaline phosphatase and osteopontin, whereas mononuclear cells stained positively for CD4.
A recombinant Sp17 protein was used with monocyte-derived dendritic cells and autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells to generate Sp17 specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs).
Monocytes (MOs) have the unique ability to differentiate into immature dendritic cells (iDCs) (MO?iDC) under the influence of interleukin-4 and granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (IL-4&GM-CSF).
Nerve growth factor (NGF) resulted in bipolar neuronal cells, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor led to multipolar neuronal cells.
IQGAP1? staining was observed in neurons (Map2? cells), in cancer stem cells (CSC; nestin?) and in several macrophages (CD31? or Iba1?).
Histology quantified stage of healing, lymphocyte infiltration, TRAP+ cells, and osteocalcin deposition.
Second, it is demonstrated that there is no granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), CSF-1, interleukin-3 (IL-3) and possibly stem cell factor (SCF) production by the marrow cells during the contact.
Associations were confirmed between AD and platelet GSK3? activity, lymphocyte CREB activity and plasma BDNF.
Deletion of the essential autophagy genes Atg5 or Atg7 in T cells resulted in decreased thymocyte and peripheral T cell numbers, and Atg5-deficient T cells had a decrease in cell survival.
In B lymphopoiesis, the earliest CD34+ CD10+ B-cell precursor (BCP) cells, further subdivided by expression of CD19, displayed the highest MIC2 density of BM leukocytes.
The secretory protein Slit2 and its receptors Robo1 and Robo4 are considered to regulate mobility and permeability of endothelial cells and other cell types.
Altered expression of carbonic anhydrase-related protein XI in neuronal cells expressing mutant ataxin-3.
