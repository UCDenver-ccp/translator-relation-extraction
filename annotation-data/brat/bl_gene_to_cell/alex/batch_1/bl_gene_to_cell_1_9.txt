LRRK2 Expression Is Deregulated in Fibroblasts and Neurons from Parkinson Patients with Mutations in PINK1.
Double staining was performed for elastase (neutrophils), tryptase (mast cells), and CD36 (macrophages).
By 6 hours, TNF synthesizing cells were identified as Mac-1 immunopositive, glial fibrillary acidic protein immunonegative microglia-macrophages.
Tissue samples were evaluated immunohistochemically by quantifying the presence of macrophages (CD68-PGM1(+), CD68-KP1(+)), hemosiderophages (Perls blue), T lymphocytes (CD2(+), CD3(+), CD4(+), CD7(+), CD8(+)), B lymphocytes (CD20(+)), natural killer cells (CD56(+)), mast cells (NaSDCl(+)), Schwann cells (S100(+)), and endothelial cells (CD34(+)) using a stereological technique.
The cultured cells expressed stem cell marker alkaline phosphatase, Oct4, Sox2, and SSEA-1.
Tenascin-C is an anti-adhesive substrate for fibroblasts, whereas fibrillin-2 stimulates cell attachment.
The horizontal cells, rod bipolar cells and amacrine cells were labeled by antiserum against calbindin, protein kinase Calpha, and calretinin, respectively.
Here we analyzed the expression of Smaug1/Samd4a variants and Smaug2/Samd4b in primary hippocampal neurons and non-neuronal cell lines.
In CML the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene was detected in CD34+/CD133+ cells, granulo-monocytes, eosinophils, erythrocytes, megakaryocytes and B-lymphocytes.
Whereas SGE-1X led to the recruitment of all leucocytes subtypes including CD4(+) T cells, CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils, the immune cell profile in the SGE-3X group differed dramatically, as CD4(+) T cells, CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils were decreased and CD8(+) T cells were increased.
Furthermore, IL-1 alpha, IL-2, IL-5, granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, low m.w.
All T-regulatory cell parameters, including percent lymphocytes CD4+/CD152+ and CD4+/CD25+/CD152+, and mean and median CD152 expression in CD4+/CD25+ lymphocytes, were higher in CHL than in B-NHL and benign.
TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta R1 and TGF-beta R2 chiefly expressed in the epithelial cells, also expressed in the vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts.
We used dual immunolabeling for BDNF and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in astrocytes, adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein (APC) for oligodendrocytes or type III CDH receptor (OX42) for microglia/macrophages.
In colon crypts, CD24(+) cells residing between Lgr5 stem cells may represent the Paneth cell equivalents.
Assessment of p16, p21, and p27 in granulocytic differentiation of human promyelocytic HL-60 cell line.
We replaced granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor with macrophage colony-stimulating factor from a serum-free culture containing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, stem cell factor, Flt3 ligand, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor-beta1.
The phenotype consisted primarily of CD3+/CD4+ lymphocytes with a reciprocal reduction in CD56+/CD16+ cells.
Immunohistochemistry revealed CXCR6 protein predominantly localised in normal epithelial cells and some scattered stromal cells.
To verify the cellular sources of NO, immunocytochemical staining of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was followed by staining with the microglia marker Mac-1 or the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) in microglia-enriched or astrocyte-enriched cultures.
