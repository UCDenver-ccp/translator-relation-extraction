Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF), macrophage-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage CSF, interleukin-3, and interleukin-6 levels in sera from children undergoing blood stem cell autografts.
Additionally, sorted CXCR5(+) CD4(+) T cells increased production of AMAs by autologous CD19(+) B cells.
Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining revealed increased osteoclast numbers in tibias of 2-month-old Col1a1-Cnn1 mice, and increased numbers of osteoclasts co-cultured with Col1a1-Cnn1 osteoblasts.
OVOL2 is a critical regulator of ER71/ETV2 in generating FLK1+, hematopoietic, and endothelial cells from embryonic stem cells.
Phenotypically the ALAK cells included both CD56+/CD3- NK cells and CD56-/CD3+ T cells.
Through comparative analysis of expression in platelets and other blood cells we demonstrated that G6b, G6f, and LRRC32 are restricted to the platelet lineage, whereas LAT2 and SUCNR1 were also detected in other blood cells.
Cytotoxic activity of monocytes may be mediated by their production of TNF-alpha, and IL-2 has been shown to induce TNF-alpha production in monocytes and alveolar macrophages.
Natural killer cells prime the responsiveness of autologous CD4+ T cells to CTLA4-Ig and interleukin-10 mediated inhibition in an allogeneic dendritic cell-mixed lymphocyte reaction.
Alarmins from corneal epithelial cells upregulate CCL11 and VCAM-1 in corneal fibroblasts.
Using an affinity-purified anti-myogenin antibody, three stages of mouse myoblast C2C12 cells during myogenesis could be identified: proliferating myoblasts as myogenin-negative mononucleated cells, differentiating myoblasts as myogenin-positive mononucleated cells, and myotubes as myogenin-positive multinucleated cells.
In addition to the polarized activation of STAT4 in (Th)1 cells and STAT6 in (Th)2 cells, we found that STAT3 and STAT5 are selectively activated in (Th)1 cells after differentiation.
The EP3 or EP4 knockout suppressed S100A4+ fibroblasts, CXCL12+, and/or CXCR4+ stromal cells as well.
Ala1,3,11,15-ET-1 did not induce neuronal degeneration and activation of microglia/macrophage in these brain regions.
We examined whether MV infects Langerhans cell-like dendritic cells (LCs) generated from CD14(+) monocytes in the presence of GM-CSF, IL-4, and TGF-beta1.
It suppressed CD3(+)/CD69(+), CD4(+)/CD25(+), CD8(+) T-cell, CD19(+), B220/CD23(+) B-cell, MHCII(+)/CD11c(+), and Gr-1(+)/CD11b(+) cell activations.
B6 cells produced significantly more MCP-1 and VCAM-1 proteins in response to MM-LDL than C3H cells.
We analysed the proportions of CD25(+)CD4(+) T cells and natural killer T cells (NKT cells), and the expression levels of Foxp3, CTLA-4, CD28, ICOS, PD-1 and BTLA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and purified CD4(+) T cells.
Interestingly, TmC-2 stimulated CD29-mediated cell-cell or cell-finbronectin adhesions in monocytes, while CD43-mediated cell adhesion was down-regulated.
RT-PCR, flow cytometric and immunofluorescence assays showed that TLR3 is expressed in CD34(+) cells, megakaryocytes, and platelets.
Selective inhibition of PED protein expression sensitizes B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
