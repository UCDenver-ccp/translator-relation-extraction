Colonic stromal cells, but not epithelial cells or resident CD11b+ phagocytic cells, produced CCL2 in response to C. rodentium in a Nod2-dependent manner.
Immunofluorescent double staining showed that VSIG4 was present on CD68(+) macrophages, but absent from CD3(+) T cells, CD31(+) endothelial cells, and CK-18(+) epithelial cells.
Our results showed that these cells are clonogenic, express skeletal progenitor cell markers Pax7, ALDH1, Myod, and Desmin and the stem cell markers Nanog, Sox2, and Oct3/4 significantly elevated over controls.
Immunofluorescence results demonstrated colocalization of CCL25+ cells and CD68+ macrophages.
Postmigratory, premyelinating oligodendrocytes express Dcc but not netrin 1, whereas mature myelinating oligodendrocytes express both.
Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Interleukin-3 (IL-3) and Interleukin-5 (IL-5) have overlapping, pleiotropic effects on hematopoietic cells, including neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes and early progenitor cells.
A significant positive correlation was found between VEGF-C in cancer cells and VEGF receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) in vascular endothelial cells, but not between VEGF-C in cancer cells and VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells.
CASK-interactive proteins, Caskin1 and Caskin2, are multidomain neuronal scaffold proteins.
The cytokines macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) promote differentiation of monocytes into macrophages with distinct phenotypes and unique functional abilities.
Sclerostin is an osteocyte-derived protein that has a potent inhibitory effect on osteoblast activity.
Changes in the expression of Klf4, NFIa, NFIb, Ptbp1 and SOX9 indicated that fibroblasts were differentiated into an astrocytic lineage.
DTT increased CD11b expression on lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils.
CD45+ hematopoietic cells within the SVF contain CD14+ cells that co-express the CD34 progenitor marker and the endothelial cell antigens VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2/KDR), VEGFR1/Flt1, and Tie2.
Chorein is expressed in a wide variety of further cells, yet nothing is known about the impact of chorein on cells other than neurons, erythrocytes and platelets.
Here, we show that telomerase activity is not detectable in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), which have the phenotype SH2+, SH3+, SH4+, CD29+, CD44+, CD14-, CD34- and CD45-, and have the capacity to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts.
A decrease in vaspin expression in KCs stimulated the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-?, IL-1?, IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 by co-cultured dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils.
Silencing of NRP2, but not NRP1, affected cell positioning of adult newborn neurons.
Mechanistically, insulin resistance in adipocytes results in production of the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), which recruits monocytes and activates proinflammatory macrophages.
In transfected baby hamster kidney cells, Rat1 fibroblasts, and normal IM9 lymphoblasts, PTP1D directly binds activated insulin receptor.
The expression level of Tyrp1 and Tyr in PIG1(normal melanocyte cell lines) cells was analyzed by western blotting.
