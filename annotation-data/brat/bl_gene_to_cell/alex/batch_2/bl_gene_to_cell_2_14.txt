Tumor cells were positive for GFAP, S-100 protein, and p53 and negative for neuronal antigens.
Endogenous NO inhibits insulin release in isolated beta cells and insulin-degrading enzyme activity in hepatocytes, while NO release from endothelial cells has been suggested to enhance insulin action.
Thus, macrophage-FABP4 has a novel role in pulmonary host defense against P. aeruginosa infection by facilitating crosstalk between macrophages and neutrophils via regulation of macrophage CXCL1 production.-Liang,
With the use of macrophage cell lines expressing functional or nonfunctional Nramp1, we found significantly elevated Lcn2 mRNA and protein levels in Nramp1-expressing cells.
SNPs in PEAR1 associated with increased platelet response to CRP-XL and increased PEAR1 protein expression after platelet degranulation.
NF-kappaB mediates lipid-induced fetuin-A expression in hepatocytes that impairs adipocyte function effecting insulin resistance.
[Expression of HLA-G protein in trophoblast cells].
Myxoid cells reacted to S-100 protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and neuron specific enolase.
In both PLNs and ILNs PTHrP protein was localized to high endothelial venules, lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages.
EMD stimulates CTGF expression, and the interaction is modulated via TGF-beta in osteoblastic cells.
Furthermore, LRP1-deficient microglia in cell culture expressed significantly decreased levels of interleukin-1? and interleukin-6 when treated with LPS.
Human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine derived from activated T cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages.
ENT contained neurons and glial cells expressing various markers of maturity, such as synaptophysin, neuronal nuclei-specific protein (NeuN), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and were electrophysiologically active.
Further, ETS1-CD4 and LEF1-CD4 dual staining demonstrated that both salivary gland epithelial cells and lymphocytic infiltrates had increased levels of ETS1 and LEF1.
Primary cultures of neurons and astrocytes express Mct8, Lat1, and Lat2.
Mechanistically, reduced tolerization of Nod2-null macrophages was mediated by recognition of bacteria through Nod1 because it was abolished in macrophages deficient in Nod1 and Nod2.
Additionally, NIC was elevated in Trp53(-/-) thymocytes as compared to Trp53(+/+) thymocytes.
However, GFAP C294S shows defective or delayed network formation in GFAP-deficient cells, including SW13/cl.2 cells and GFAP- and vimentin-deficient primary astrocytes.
CXCR4 and CXCL12 were homogeneously expressed within tumor cells, while CXCR7 was mainly detected in tumor endothelial cells and CXCL11 in pericytes.
Stress decreased lymphocyte responsiveness to PHA and PWM, percent of CD4+ cells and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ cells.
