The percentages of activated monocytes/macrophages, T cells, and possibly B cells; of gamma/delta T cell receptor (TCR)-bearing T cells; of CD4- CD8- alpha/beta TCR-bearing T cells; and serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were high in patients with active visceral leishmaniasis.
TNF-alpha inhibits toll-like receptor 4 expression on monocytic cells via tristetraprolin during cardiopulmonary bypass.
We show that CD14 is actively synthesized by neutrophils as a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol-anchored protein, indistinguishable in size from monocyte CD14.
CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, CD19(+) B cells, and CD14(+) monocytes were purified from PBMCs.
Circulating CD14+ monocytes are precursors of phagocytes, such as macrophages and dendritic cells.
Additionally, CD19-positive B-lymphocytes represent practically the only lymphocyte population capable of expressing CD35.
Serial sections were stained immunohistochemically for TRAF6 as well as CD68 (macrophage), CD3 (T cell), CD20 (B cell), CD38 (plasmocyte), CD79a (B lineage cells from pre-B cell to plasmocyte stage), and CD34 (endothelial cell).
In vivo control of diabetogenic T-cells by regulatory CD4+CD25+ T-cells expressing Foxp3.
It is known that glial cells (astrocytes and microglia) express various chemokine receptors like CCR1, -3, -5, and CXCR4.
The morphology of parvalbumin-positive neurons closely resembled that of neurons containing calbindin, a related calcium-binding protein.
Recombinant CXCL9 and rCXCL10 caused migration of CD4+, CD8+, CD4+CD8+ T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, and rCXCL11 increased migration of CD4+ T and NK cells in PBMCs.
These findings indicate that TNF-alpha attenuated cell death of Prnp(-/-) neuronal cells by induction of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L),and that decreases in Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) played crucial roles in the apoptosis of Prnp(-/-) neuronal cells.
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 are important chemotactic proteins for macrophages and neutrophils, the predominant inflammatory cells associated with COPD.
To determine their ability to differentiate into osteoclasts, NCD14+ monocytes were further cultured with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) together with RANKL or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha).
CD34+ cell-derived hematopoietic precursors amplified with FLT3-ligand, thrombopoietin and stem cell factor became, after a 6-day induction with GM-CSF, IL-4 and TGF-beta1, HLA-DR+, CD1a+, CD83-, CD86-, CD80- cells.
A panel of monoclonal antibodies specific for inflammatory cells (T lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells) and different adhesion molecules (E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, LFA-1, VLA-4) was used.
In thrombi, TLR-4 and TLR-2 were overexpressed on CD14-labelled monocytes, and TLR-2 was increased on CD66b-labelled granulocytes, in comparison with leucocytes in AB.
The captured cells expressed neuronal NOS (marker of macula densa), NOX2, and NOX4 but not NOX1.
Expression of ATF3 protein in wild-type mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells is below the detectable levels, whereas, JDP2 disrupted MEF cells display noticeable level of ATF3 protein.
ME was analyzed by flow cytometry for CD45- and CD45+ cell populations or used to isolate stromal fibroblast cells.
