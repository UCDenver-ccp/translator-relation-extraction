The tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production of monocytes, the serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels, the CD11b expression on either monocytes or granulocytes, and the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stimulated with culture supernatants of monocytes were compared between the 2 groups.
We previously demonstrated that monocytes/macrophages express RCAS1.
This cell specificity appeared to be related to N-cadherin, since granulosa cells and oocytes express N-cadherin and a N-cadherin antibody attenuates the effect of granulosa cell contact.
As to AVP neurons, great quantities of AVP cells were strongly double labeled with pERK1/2 while there were nearly no Fos-ir nuclei in AVP-ir cells.
Histopathological and immunohistochemistry procedures were done in order to get a panel of inflammatory positive cells for CD3 (T lymphocytes), CD45RA (B lymphocytes), CD18 (beta 2 integrin), CD163 (ED2 protein), CD54 (ICAM-1), and MAC 387 (monocytes and macrophages).
Olfactory nerve glial cells were immunoreactive for the S100 beta protein and nestin, an intermediate filament found in early neuronal progenitor cells and Schwann cells.
Progenitor cells expressing MEF2, GATA-4, and nestin (which identify the cells as myocytes) and Flk1 (which identifies the cells as endothelial cells) were identified.
Fractalkine (Fkn) is a chemokine that affects cells expressing its receptor, CX3CR1, including CD16-positive (CD16+) monocytes/macrophages (CD16+ Mos).
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was expressed in monocytes and B cells, IL-10 in monocytes, and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 in monocytes and T cells from patients with active disease.
Certain factors (IL-1, IL-6, IL-3) are active at the level of the pluripotential stem cell, whereas others (eg macrophage-CSF, granulocyte-CSF, Epo) facilitate differentiation of lineage restricted cell populations.
NANOG protein was detected in germline stem cells (gonocytes) within the developing testis.
Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were strongly positive for histiocytic markers: CD163, CD68, lysozyme, and PU.1, as well as strongly positive for dendritic cell markers: S100 and fascin, but were negative for CD1a (Langerhans cell marker), CD21/CD35 (follicular dendritic cell markers), B-cell, and T cell markers.
Endothelial colony-forming cells expressed markers associated with induced pluripotent stem cells, including SOX2, POU5F1, c-MYC, and KLF4.
Receptor EphA2 was expressed in osteoclast precursors and osteoblasts.
In mammals, three nucleoplasmin/nucleophosmin (NPM) family proteins-NPM1, NPM2 and NPM3-expressed in oocytes are presumed to cooperatively regulate sperm chromatin remodeling.
Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is produced by endothelial cells and cardiac myocytes.
Leukosialin, also called CD43 or sialophorin, is a major sialoglycoprotein expressed widely in various leukocytes (granulocytes, monocytes/macrophages and T-lymphocytes).
SIRT2 regulates insulin sensitivity in insulin resistant neuronal cells.
We found TNF to stimulate neurons (i) to produce CCL2, CCL7 and CXCL10, chemokines acting on mononuclear phagocytes and (ii) to stimulate the expression of the macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF/Csf1), which leads to elongation of microglia processes.
MSC differentiation was assessed with antibodies to hepatocyte-specific marker cytokeratin 18 (CK18), cholangiocyte-specific protein CK19, smooth muscle cell-specific protein ?-SMA, the endothelial cell marker CD31, or the active fibroblast marker FAP?.
