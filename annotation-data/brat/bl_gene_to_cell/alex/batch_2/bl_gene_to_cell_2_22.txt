Compared to melanocytes increased PAX2 protein levels were detectable in melanoma cell lines.
The growth of JAK2V617F-mutated HEL cells and PV erythroblasts was inhibited, indicating that JAK2-mutated cells depend on HGF and IL-11 for their growth.
In addition, we have found that USSCs and USSC-derived neuron-like cells express transcripts of genes associated with development and/or survival of dopaminergic mesencephalic neurons including En1, En2, Nurr1, Ptx3, Pax2, Wnt1 and Wnt3a.
CD34- Orbital Fibroblasts From Patients With Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy Modulate TNF-? Expression in CD34+ Fibroblasts and Fibrocytes.
Adipocytes expressed angiopoietin-1, while adipose endothelial cells expressed angiopoietin-2 and tie2.
Overexpression of ATF4 in endothelial cells significantly increased the secretion of MCP-1 and promoted THP-1 monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion.
Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) are primary macrophages obtained by in vitro differentiation of bone marrow cells in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF or CSF1).
Both CSAD and GADL1 are being expressed in neurons, whereas only CSAD mRNA was detected in astrocytes.
All cell lines contained interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-5, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) transcripts, whereas granulocyte M-CSF, TNFalpha, IL-3, IL-4, and IL-7 were diversely expressed.
Distribution of circulating T, B, and natural killer lymphocytes, monocytes, and CD33(hi) myeloid, CD16+, and plasmacytoid dendritic cell subsets.
VPAC1R was expressed by dermal endothelial cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, mast cells, and keratinocytes, whereas VPAC2R was expressed only in keratinocytes.
TNF-alpha stimulates IL-8 production in healthy epidermal keratinocyte cell lines.
All cells colocalized with the stem cell and cochlear-supporting-cell marker Sox2 as well as the supporting cell and Schwann cell marker Sox10; however, they did not colocalize with the Schwann cell marker Krox20, spiral ganglion marker NF200, nor glial fibrillary acidic acid (GFAP)-expressing supporting cell marker.
Roles of TLR2, TLR4, NOD2, and NOD1 in pulp fibroblasts.
Osteoblasts release osteoclasts from calcitonin-induced quiescence.
Interestingly, gliosome preparations were found to be enriched for different classes of known astrocyte proteins, such as VAMP3 (involved in astrocyte exocytosis), Ezrin (perisynaptic astrocyte cytoskeletal protein), and Basigin (astrocyte membrane glycoprotein), as well as for G-protein-mediated signaling proteins.
We hypothesised that RACK1 recruits proteins to FAK, to regulate FAK activity in neuronal cells.
Tenascin and fibronectin expression in human mesothelial cells and pleural mesothelioma cell-line cells.
Morphologically, CD4+/Leu-7+ cells are typical large granular lymphocytes undistinguishable from CD16+ effector NK cells.
Mononuclear phagocytes in early demyelinating stages comprised CCR1+/CCR5+ hematogenous monocytes and CCR1-/CCR5- resident microglial cells.
