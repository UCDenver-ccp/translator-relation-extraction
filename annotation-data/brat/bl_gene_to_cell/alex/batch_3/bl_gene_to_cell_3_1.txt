RT-PCR analyses showed that PDL cells expressed the osteoblast markers, Runx2, osterix, and osteocalcin.
Although both CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells produced TNF-alpha and TNF-beta in response to toxin stimulation in the presence of HLA class II+ cells, the former T-cell subset was the major source of producers of TNF-alpha and TNF-beta.
GM-CSF induced pim-1 protein in several myeloid cell lines, most of which demonstrated a proliferative response, but did not induce pim-1 protein expression in neutrophils or monocytic cells.
CD34 was expressed by endothelial cells and CD11b+ macrophages/microglia invading the injured tissue as observed 2 weeks following injury.
Synthesis of thromboplastin protein by a murine macrophage-like cell line.
SSc monocytes exhibit a different phenotype than normal monocytes, expressing high levels of ColI, CD14 and CD34.
NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophage cell lines by prion protein fibrils as the source of IL-1? and neuronal toxicity.
Immune cells (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, B cell, NK cell and macrophages) infiltration and astrocytes/microglial activation were attenuated in CCR5-/- mice.
Furthermore, staining for CD45RB (as opposed to CD68) facilitated the identification of Ki67+ microglia, indicating that CD68 could underestimate proliferating microglia.
Characteristics of IL-3 derived and IL-3 dependent lymphocyte cell lines.
These microparticles were mostly CD31+/CD45- (endothelial), partly CD45+/CD66b+ (granulocyte), and negative for B and T cell markers.
C-Reactive protein enhances the formation of monocyte-platelet aggregates and also promotes P-selectin expression and platelet adhesion to endothelial cells.
Generally, NGF specifically recognizes neurons with the NGF receptor, whereas GFAP does the glia, and CNTF does the motor neurons.
Cox-2 and osteopontin in cocultured platelets and mesangial cells: role of glucocorticoids.
Ligation of CR1 (C3b receptor, CD35) on CD4+ T lymphocytes enhances viral replication in HIV-infected cells.
The histiocytic cells were positive for antibodies against S-100 protein and CD1a, but negative for anti-CD68.
Osteoclast precursors in synovial tissues are CD14+ monocyte/macrophages.
Parvalbumin+ Neurons and Npas1+ Neurons Are Distinct Neuron Classes in the Mouse External Globus Pallidus.
ILT2/LIR1(+) T cells demonstrated diverse TCRBV repertoires in contrast to KIR(+) T cells, while numbers of peripheral ILT2/LIR1(+) T cells were greater than KIR(+) T cells and the majority of ILT2/LIR1(+) T cells did not coexpress KIR.
First, APC was highly expressed in migrating neuroblasts and APC deletion disturbed the differentiation from Mash1-expressing transient amplifying cells to neuroblasts with concomitant accumulation of ?-catenin.
