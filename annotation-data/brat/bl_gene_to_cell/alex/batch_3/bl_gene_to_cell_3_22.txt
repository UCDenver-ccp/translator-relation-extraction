Keratinocyte cadherin desmoglein 1 controls melanocyte behavior through paracrine signaling.
Normal macrophages, macrophages stimulated by bacillus Calmette-Gu?rin, and liver cells lack this particle and the associated group of cationic proteins.
The Tsg118 protein is predominantly expressed in proliferating somatic cells and in male germ cells.
Ganglion cells were positive for NSE and synaptophysin, while Schwann cells stained positively with S100 protein and GFAP.
They strongly implicate reactive astrocytes with GLT1 and GADD45 transcripts in preventing secondary neuronal death.
B2AR-mediated increase in Treg-cell suppressive function was associated with decreased IL-2 mRNA levels in responder CD4(+) T cells and improved Treg-cell-induced conversion of CD4(+) Foxp3(-) cells into Foxp3(+) induced Treg cells.
CXCR4 was induced on both lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages, whereas CCR5 and CCR3 were induced on monocytes/macrophages but not on lymphocytes.
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and Wnt3a, which are secreted by osteocytes, osteocalcin (OCN) and IGF-1, which are produced by osteoblasts and sclerostin which is secreted by both cell types, might impact skeletal muscle cells.
We show here that the intracellular serpin, proteinase inhibitor 6 (PI-6), is present in monocytes, granulocytes, and myelomonocytic cell lines.
Human lymphocytes are selected by backgating on populations of CD45+high CD14- cells.
They have been designated sperm histone H2B(1) Psammechinus and sperm histone H2B(2) Psammechinus.
Protein kinase C (PKC)?-mediated G?q stimulation of ERK5 protein pathway in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts.
This suppressive function of decidual CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells required cell-to-cell contact.
Many neoplastic cells, otherwise typical of PXA, expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein, while neuronal cells with marked atypia were immunopositive for synaptophysin and neurofilament protein.
Samples were measured for the number of leukocytes and lymphocytes, as well as for CD3+, CD4+, CD28+CD4+, IFN-gamma+CD4+, IL-4+CD4+ cells.
Compared to the sham NG neurons, diabetes induced the expression of HCN2 in the A-fiber neurons besides overexpression of HCN1 and HCN3; and enhanced the expression of HCN2 and HCN3 in C-fiber neurons.
On in vitro differentiation assays, NSCs produced beta-III tubulin(+) neurons, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP(+)) astrocytes, and O4(+) oligodendrocytes.
STAT3 regulates CD4+ T cell survival and differentiation.
Wnt modulators, SFRP-1, and SFRP-2 are expressed in osteoblasts and differentially regulate hematopoietic stem cells.
HL60 cells, therefore, express CD40 protein during differentiation not only toward monocytes but also toward granulocytes, at least transiently.
