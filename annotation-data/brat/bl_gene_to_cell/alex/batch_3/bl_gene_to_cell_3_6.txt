Flow cytometric analysis included CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(-)FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs), ?? T cells, B cells, NK cells and dendritic cells.
Lymphocyte subsets, natural killer cell activity, percentage of CD56+CD16+ (percentage of natural killer cells), and percentage of CD11b+CD8+ (percentage of suppressor T lymphocytes) were measured perioperatively.
In RA monocytes/macrophages, neither CXCL16 expression, nor CXCL16 regulation is different from healthy controls.
Within lymphocytes, the percentage of CD45RAbright+ CD4+ cells decreased, together with a decline of that of CD4+ cells.
Compared with the expression in peripheral lymphocytes, prominent expression of EphB6 protein was demonstrated in CD4+CD8+ double-positive mouse thymocytes.
Expression and regulation of antiviral protein APOBEC3G in human neuronal cells.
TNF-alpha and GFAP-IR satellite cells surrounded p55-IR neurons.
Peripheral CD56+/CD16+ natural killer (NK) cell concentration, CD56+/CD16- NK cell concentration, white blood cell (WBC) concentration and lymphocyte concentration were statistically correlated to herpes viremia.
Insulin/insulin-like growth factor I and other epigenetic modulators of myelin basic protein expression in isolated oligodendrocyte progenitor cells.
The survival of cultured neurons was not impaired by NPC1 deficiency, nor was death of Npc1(-/-) and Npc1(+/+) neurons in microglia-neuron co-cultures increased by NPC1 deficiency in microglia.
We found distinct changes of T cell/monocyte (CD4/CD14) and B cell/monocyte (CD20/CD14) ratios between clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)/multiple sclerosis and other neurologic diseases or other inflammatory neurologic diseases.
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells induce alternative activation of human monocytes/macrophages.
In addition to iNOS, lovastatin and NaPA also inhibited LPS-induced expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 in rat primary astrocytes, microglia, and macrophages.
During T-cell activation, several cytokines including IL-6, IL-7 and IL-15, play crucial roles in the development of T cells into memory T cells.
The adipocyte-myocyte axis in insulin resistance.
IL-33 induced activation of both ERK and p38 MAPK in endothelial cells but only ERK in epithelial cells.
An analysis of PBMCs stimulated with IL-2 indicated that IL-2 exposure induced p-ERK in CD56bright NK cells and CD14+ monocytes, but not in CD3+ T cells or CD21+ B cells.
Leukocyte infiltration during aggravation of acute pancreatitis is mediated by leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction via leukocyte integrin CD11b/18.
Dexamethasone increased expression of CD14, CD36, and CD68, molecules characteristic of monocytes/macrophages and induced CD14+CD83- cells, a subset distinct both from immature DC and mature DC.
The BrdU-positive cells not expressing markers for mature neurons colabel with nestin, an intermediate filament protein typical of neuronal precursors.
