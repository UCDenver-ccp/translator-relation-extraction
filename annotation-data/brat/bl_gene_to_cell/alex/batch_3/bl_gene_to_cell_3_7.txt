TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 are constitutively expressed in astrocytes and neurons.
The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 have been identified as the major coreceptors for HIV-1 on CD4+ cells and macrophages.
The pNSCs expressed the neural stem cell markers Pax6, Sox1, Sox2, and Nestin; were negative for Oct4; could be expanded for multiple passages; and could be differentiated into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, in addition to the brain region-specific neuronal subtypes GABAergic, dopaminergic, and motor neurons.
In TP63/KLF4-induced keratinocyte-like cell-state reprogramming, OVOL2 greatly facilitated the activation of epithelial and keratinocyte-specific genes.
Peripheral and central neuronal ATF3 precedes CD4+ T-cell infiltration in EAE.
Antibodies against monocytes (CD14) and macrophages (CD68) were applied to attribute the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-10 to resident renal or infiltrating cells.
Flow cytometry revealed Ang II-induced increases of cardiac CD45+F4/80+CD11b+ and CD45+F4/80+CD11c+ macrophages and CD45+CD4+ lymphocytes.
In comparisons of chemokine receptor expression on naive (CD45RA+) and memory (CD45RO+) CD3+ lymphocytes, there were greater percentages of memory CD3+/CD4+ lymphocytes expressing CCR4, CCR5, and CXCR3 than naive CD3+/CD4+ lymphocytes in RA PB and RA SF, and greater percentages of memory CD3+/CD8+ lymphocytes expressing CCR4, CCR5, and CXCR3 than naive CD3+/CD8+ lymphocytes in RA SF, suggesting receptor up-regulation upon lymphocyte activation.
A small number of vascular endothelial cells, macrophages, and T cells also expressed Ets-1 protein.
As expected, FLFCs constitutively produced macrophage colony stimulating factor and induced CD34(+) differentiation into macrophages independently of cell-to-cell contact.
DM patients had a T-cell signature comprising increased CD4+ and TH17 cell frequencies and increased immune cell expression of IL-6.
NANOS2 rescues NANOS3 functions in the maintenance of primordial germ cells, whereas NANOS3 fails to replace NANOS2 functions in the male germ cell pathway.
Flow cytometry was used to identify and follow three cell-populations: Th17-cells (CD4+IL-17+ T-cells), natural regulatory T-cells (CD4(+)CD25(bright)FoxP3(+); nTregs) and IL-10 producing Type-1 regulatory T-cells (CD4+IL-10+ T-cells; Tr1).
Adhesion of lymphocytes to stimulated vascular endothelial cells occurs via ICAM1-dependent and ICAM1-independent pathways.
Developing megakaryocytes are distinguished from progenitor cells by the appearance of platelet proteins such as platelet factor 4 (PF 4).
Conversely, preprotachykinin A-immunoreactive neurons constituted only 6% of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons, 4% of calbindin-immunoreactive neurons and 1% of somatostatin-immunoreactive neurons.
Using immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that PHACTR1 protein is expressed strongly in human atherosclerotic plaque macrophages, lipid-laden foam cells, adventitial lymphocytes and endothelial cells.
Tob1 was stabilized in both Skp2(-/-) mouse fibroblasts and Skp2 knockdown HeLa cells.
CD4(+)CD25(+) T-cells control autoimmunity in the absence of B-cells.
Double staining for TNF-alpha and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) suggested that the TNF-alpha-positive cells are most likely microglia, not astrocytes.
