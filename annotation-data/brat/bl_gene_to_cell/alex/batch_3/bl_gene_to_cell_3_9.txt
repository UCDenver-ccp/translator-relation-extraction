The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is expressed in maturation stage ameloblasts, odontoblasts and bone cells.
nerve growth factor (NGF), mast cells (c-kit), macrophages (CD68), and T cells (CD3).
The present study suggests that P2X-4, with pharmacological properties distinct from those of P2X-1+, P2X-2, and P2X-3, mediates extracellular ATP-induced biological effects in non-neuronal cells, including endocrine cells, as well as in neuronal cells.
In contrast, IL-3 increased the number of CD45+ hematopoietic cells in stromal-cell cultures.
In addition, microglia, macrophages, and neutrophils isolated from the brain abscesses of MyD88 KO mice produced significantly less TNF-alpha, IL-6, MIP-1alpha/CCL3, and IFN-gamma-induced protein 10/CXCL10 compared with WT cells.
We show here that co-culture of na?ve T cells with flagellin-exposed monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) generates CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) T cells that transiently express FOXP3 together with CD25 but do not suppress proliferation of CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells.
Immunohistochemical data revealed the presence of clusterin in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells whereas apolipoprotein E was mainly expressed in non-neuronal cells.
Bam32/DAPP1 and SKAPs function to promote activation of monomeric guanosine triphosphatases, including Rac and Rap, and promote integrin activation, lymphocyte adhesion to matrix proteins, and cell:cell interactions between B and T lymphocytes.
Expression of CCR5 and CCR3 by CD8-, CD8+ T cells and CD14+ monocytes was increased in SF compared to PB cells in patients with RA and other arthritides.
HIV-1 infection significantly induced CD4+ T-cell intrinsic Caspase-1 activity, whereas Caspase-1 inhibition, but not Caspase-3 inhibition, significantly blocked CD4+ T cell depletion.
Regarding the morphology, most GluR1-undetectable/GluR2-expressing neurons were pyramidal cells in layers II/III, V, and VI, whereas most GluR1-expressing/GluR2-undetectable neurons were nonpyramidal cells in layers II-VI.
GLP-1 and GLP-2 were localized to epithelial cells, GLP-1 also at myenteric neurons.
hRPE cells were stimulated with thrombin TNF-alpha, monocytes, and TGF-beta2.
Neuronal TGF-beta1 mediates IL-9/mast cell interaction and exacerbates excitotoxicity in newborn mice.
In addition, besides intense BMP2 expression in almost all neurons, we found BMP2 expression in astrocytes and ependymal cells.
Other cytokines, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IFN alpha beta, granulocyte-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, IL-3, TNF-alpha, and TNF-beta were compared to IL-1 for their ability to induce a PMN influx into the peritoneum.
Zbtb32 was higher in T cells stimulated with DCIR2(+) DCs, and overexpression of Zbtb32 in T cells inhibited diabetes development, T-cell expansion, and IFN-? production.
Dll4 - Notch1 signalling directs endothelial cells into migrating tip or proliferating stalk cells.
Like neurons, HEK293 cells expressed GLUT1, GLUT3, and SVCT2.
Th2-type cytokine, IL-4 significantly increased, whereas IL-6, CD4+T cells, CD4+/CD8+ ratio and CD3+ T cells decreased.
