Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor blockade promotes ccr9(+)  lymphocyte expansion in Nod2 deficient mice.
Effect of gastrin and anti-gastrin antibodies on proliferation of hepatocyte cell lines.
Cathepsin G, a polymorphonuclear cell protease, affects the fibrinolytic system by releasing PAI-1 from endothelial cells and platelets.
ANGPTL4 was also strongly expressed in synovial lining cells, endothelial cells, stromal cells, CD68+ macrophages and plasma cells within RA synovium.
The immunocytochemistry techniques were used to identify the NSc and mature protein expression with neuron marker beta-tubulin, astrocyte marker GFAP, and oligodendrocyte marker CNPase.
Foxp3 expression in cutaneous T-cell lymphocytic infiltrates.
Immunohistochemical analysis was used to examine changes in substance P and macrophage/microglia-specific Iba1 protein immunoreactivity.
The levels of total T lymphocytes (CD3(+)), T helper lymphocytes (CD3(+)CD4(+)), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CD3(+)CD8(+)), memory T cells (CD3(+)CD8(+)CD45RO(+)), naive T cells (CD3(+)CD8(+)CD45RA(+)), Th2 cells (CD3(+)CD30(+)), B cells (CD19(+)), NK cells (CD56(+)), naive T regulatory cells (CD4(+)CD25(+)), precise T regulatory cells (CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+)) were detected by flow cytometry.
Double immunofluorescence staining revealed that CXCL12 expressed in neurons and astrocytes, and CXCR4 exclusively co-localized with neuronal cells.
Evidence of tricellulin expression by immune cells, particularly microglia.
Detection of the steroid receptor interacting protein, PAK6, in a neuronal cell line.
On both monocyte-derived macrophages and the myelomonocytic cell lines, Fc alpha R/CD89 expression was induced by calcitriol alone and additively in combination with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.
However, with increasing concentrations of SFRP-1, the number of TRAP-positive mononuclear cells increased suggesting that SFRP-1 inhibits osteoclast formation by inhibiting the fusion of mononuclear cells (osteoclast precursors).
The leukocyte-specific, cytoskeleton-binding pp52 (LSP-1, WP-34) protein is widely expressed in multiple leukocyte lineages, including B and T lymphocytes, granulocytes, and macrophages.
Rat CD14+ and CD11b+ monocytes in PBSC were partly positive for CD34, CD45, CD44, Oct3/4 and Sox2, suggesting monocytes with progenitor capacity.
Varying CXCR7 expression levels and blocking CXCL12/CXCR7 interactions in primary T cells suggest that CXCR4/CXCR7 heterodimers form in primary lymphocytes and regulate CXCL12-promoted chemotaxis.
Platelet morphological parameters including platelet count, platelet crit, mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW), as well as platelet activation as evidenced by measuring soluble platelet selectin (sP-selectin) level and the release of beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG), transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1) and platelet derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA) were evaluated.
The higher values of activated B lymphocytes (CD19+ CD23+) contrasted with impaired T cell activation, indicated by lower values of CD4+ CD38+ and CD4+ HLA-DR+ lymphocytes, a lower frequency of CD8+ CD38+ and CD8+ HLA-DR+ cells; a decreased frequency of CD4+ CD25HIGH regulatory T cells was also observed.
Marlin-1 (Jakmip1) is a microtubule-associated protein predominantly expressed in neurons and lymphoid cells.
PAX8 and PAX5 are differentially expressed in B-cell and T-cell lymphomas.
