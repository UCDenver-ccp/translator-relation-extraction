In addition to BV-2 microglial cells, p70, p402 and p40 also induced the production of TNF-alpha in mouse primary microglia and peritoneal macrophages.
We precisely analyzed the expression of human Fas antigen and Bcl-2 protein on CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and monocytes.
Crystals activate monocyte-macrophages and synoviocytes to produce high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, like TNF alpha und interleukin-1 and different chemokines.
The TRPM1+ macrophages had been eliminated, a few TRPM1/2+ cells were found while many of the cells were TRPM2+.
Requirement of HMGB1 for stromal cell-derived factor-1/CXCL12-dependent migration of macrophages and dendritic cells.
In experimental models, NEFA metabolism is influenced by adipocyte proteins such as adipocyte and keratinocyte lipid binding proteins (aP2/ALBP and mal1/KLBP) and fatty acid translocase (CD36).
MMP-1, MMP-9, and MMP-10 were mainly secreted by keratinocytes, whereas MMP-2, TIMP-1 and -2 by fibroblasts.
Mucosal lymphocytes isolated from normal human intestine expressed CD4 (14,530+/-7970 antibody-binding sites [ABSs]/cell), CCR5 (2730+/-1524 ABSs/cell), and CXCR4 (2507+/-1840 ABSs/cell), but intestinal macrophages, which also expressed CD4 (2959+/-2695 ABSs/cell), displayed no detectable CCR5 or CXCR4 ABS.
This protein normally resides inside monocytes and neutrophils and in these cells it forms heterodimers with the S100A8 protein.
The expression of CD14 and CD16 characterizes three monocyte subsets: CD14(++)CD16(-), CD14(++)CD16(+), and CD14((+))CD16(+) cells; the latter two are often denoted as 'proinflammatory' CD16(+) monocytes.
Our data indicate that Ascl1 alone or Ascl1 and NeuroD1 is sufficient to reprogram cochlear non-sensory epithelial cells into functional neurons.
While membrane localization of E-cadherin/beta-catenin was decreased in fibroblast-like cells, enhanced levels of E-cadherin/beta-catenin were detected in motile cell clusters.
Samples were exposed to specific antibodies against neurons (? tubulin), astrocytes (GFAP) and oligodendrocytes (OSP).
Pericytes synthesize renin.
Immunohistochemically, the osteoblastic and chondroblastic cells were positive for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2/4 and BMP receptor (BMPR) II.
CD1a+, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD68+ and cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen-positive cells in Bowen's disease.
Immunofluorescence revealed that AANAT protein is localized in C-cell cytoplasm, and MT? protein in both cell populations.
Allodynia was highly correlated with overexpression of CXCL10 and CXCR3, which were expressed in microglia at the early stage and in both microglia and astrocytes at the late stage, as shown by increased CXCL10 and CXCR3 immunoreactivities and double-labeled cells.
Slides were evaluated under light microscope and VCAM1 and ICAM1 positive cells (endothelial cells and leukocytes) were counted.
In normal tissue specimens, VMAT2, but not VMAT1, was expressed in mast cells, megakaryocytes, thrombocytes, basophil granulocytes, and cutaneous Langerhans cells.
