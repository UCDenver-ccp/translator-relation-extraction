BrdU reactive cells expressed the neuronal specific protein NeuN in 1% of BrdU stained cells and the astrocytic specific protein glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in 8% of the BrdU stained cells.
Reducing RFX1 in CD4(+) T cells is sufficient to cause lupus-like T and B cell hyperactivity, whereas overexpressing RFX1 suppresses T cell reactivity.
Single-cell analysis for BDNF and TrkB receptors in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells.
In peripheral blood cells, the highest levels of Nod2 were observed in CD14(+) (monocytes), CD15(+) (granulocytes), and CD40(+)/CD86(+) (dendritic cells) cell populations.
Murine pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) proliferate and form macrophage (M) colonies by cultures with granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).
Osteoblast (Runx2, Osteocalcin) and osteoclast (RANKL, Cathepsin K, TRAP) related genes were analyzed by Immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR.
cells per microliter for classical CD14++(high))CD16?, intermediate CD14++CD16+(mid) and non-classical CD14+(low))CD16++ monocytes.
The different expression patterns of TFF3 and TFF1 in the cardia suggest a stepwise maturation of surface mucous cells from TFF3/MUC5AC-positive cells close to the isthmus to TFF1/TFF3/MUC5AC-positive cells at the pit.
Immunocytochemistry was used to assess differentiation: CD133 (stem cell marker), Nestin (progenitor marker), Sox2 (progenitor marker), ?-tubulin III (neuronal marker), glial fibrillary acidic protein (astrocytic marker), and myelin basic protein (oligodendrocytic marker).
Selective deletion of Smurf2 in the osteoblast lineage recapitulates the phenotype of germline Smurf2-deficient mice, indicating that SMURF2 regulates osteoblast-dependent osteoclast activity rather than directly affecting the osteoclast.
Fibrinogen is a ligand for Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and enhances monocyte-endothelial cell interaction by coupling Mac-1 on monocytes to ICAM-1 on endothelial cells.
CD4+ CCR5+ and CD4+ CCR3+ lymphocyte subset and monocyte apoptosis in patients with acute visceral leishmaniasis.
TCR1+ lymphocytes were not abundant in comparison with TCR2+ lymphocytes in the epithelium.
Macrophage phagocytic function was similar between Plg(+/+) and Plg(-/-) mice.
CD103 marks a subset of human CD34+-derived langerin+ dendritic cells that induce T-regulatory cells via indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1.
CD3+CD8+ T cell, CD3+CD4 T cell, CD4+CD25+ Treg cell and NK cell were determined before and after chemotherapy.
Aged injured animals presented a diminished area of COX2 expression, but a significantly larger density of COX2(+) cells, with higher numbers of COX2(+) neurons during the first 24 hpl and COX2(+) microglia/macrophages later.
At later stages of inflammation, expression of EphA1, EphA3, EphB3, and EphB4 on leukocytes and endothelial cells decreases, thus promoting adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells.
We deleted Rb/p53, Rb/p53/PTEN or PTEN/p53 in adult subventricular stem cells; in ectopically neurografted stem cells; in mature parenchymal astrocytes and in transplanted astrocytes.
We pathologically evaluated the expressions of astrocytic Cx43/Cx30 and oligodendroglial Cx47/Cx32 relative to those of other astrocytic and oligodendrocyte/myelin markers among the autopsied cases.
