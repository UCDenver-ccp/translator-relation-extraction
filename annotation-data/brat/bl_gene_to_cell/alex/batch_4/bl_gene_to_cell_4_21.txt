Human peripheral blood monocytes expressed low levels of CCR8, while macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-derived human macrophages expressed significantly elevated surface levels of CCR8.
PDE9A gene expression was, however, significantly higher in the reticulocytes and neutrophils of SCD individuals, compared to control cells; Western blotting confirmed the production of PDE9A protein in SCD neutrophils and K562 cells.
Thus, vagotomy did not lead to parietal cell hypoplasia or gastrin cell hyperplasia despite profound alterations in parietal cell and gastrin cell function.
Platelet endothelial aggregation receptor 1 (PEAR1) may affect platelet-platelet contact and aggregation.
In this study we show that Hook1 and Hook3 are expressed in neurons while Hook2 is predominantly expressed in astrocytes.
Furthermore, sorted CD26(++)CD4(+) T cells contain >90-98% of Th17 cells, indicating that CD26(++) T cells harbor the Th17 lineage.
Macrophage colony-stimulating factor augments beta-amyloid-induced interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and nitric oxide production by microglial cells.
Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a potent chemotactic factor for neutrophils and T lymphocytes.
Additionally, cultures of astrocyte cell lines in presence of supernatants harvested from HTLV-1-infected T cell cultures resulted in significant increase in the mRNA of CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL10, IL-13, IL-8, NFKB1, TLR4, TNF, MMP8 and VCAM1, as compared with the values obtained when we applied supernatants of non-infected T- cell lines.
Platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1, CD31), expressed on the surfaces of leukocytes and concentrated in the junctions between endothelial cells plays an important role in transendothelial migration of neutrophils and monocytes.
COX-1 was expressed in microglia, and COX-2 and TSPO were expressed in microglia and neurons.
We found CFTR protein expression in monocytes, but this expression was limited or undetectable in neutrophils.
The SRG3 protein is expressed about three times higher in thymocytes than in peripheral lymphocytes.
Immunohistochemical studies characterized two types of cells: (1) polygonal cells expressing neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin A, and synaptophysin and (2) S100 protein-positive sustentacular cells.
Wnt5a, Fz5, and Ror2 were expressed in macrophages/foam cells within the plaque.
N-cadherin (CDH2), the neuronal cadherin, stimulates cell-cell contacts during migration and invasion of cells and is able to suppress tumour cell growth.
Adiponectin and leptin were also detected in osteoblast-induced cells.
Lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), macrophage-1 molecule (Mac-1) and very late appearing antigen-4 (VLA-4), all ligands of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, were present on the transmigrated neutrophils and macrophages.
Insulin inhibited lipolysis in control adipocytes but had a reduced effect on low-protein adipocytes.
In expression analyses we show that VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 are preferentially expressed by cultured SVZ-derived doublecortin+ neuroblasts, while VGLUT3 is found on GFAP+ glial cells.
