Upon in vitro polarization of DO11.10 na?ve T cells, Th1- and Th2-polarized cells dominantly expressed CXCR3 and CCR4, respectively, while Th17-polarized cells expressed CCR6 and CCR4.
Several proteins strongly expressed by osteocytes are involved in these processes, e.g., sclerostin, DMP-1, PHEX, FGF23 and MEPE, while others are upregulated during differentiation of osteoblasts into osteocytes, e.g., osteocalcin and E11.
Although C5a induced degranulation in LAD2 and CD34(+) cell-derived mast cells, it did not activate RBL-2H3 cells expressing MrgX1 or MrgX2.
Overexpression of MKP-1 in fibrosarcoma cells and fibroblasts reduced proliferation, while expression of a phosphatase-resistant p38 protein (p38(N316)) enhanced proliferation of normal fibroblasts.
After 7 days of differentiation into neurons, neuronal cells derived from control iPS cells were positive for ?III-tubulin and MAP2.
MLN B cell numbers correlate with ileitis severity in SAMP1/YitFc mice, and cotransfer of SAMP1/YitFc MLN B cells along with CD4(+) T cells increases ileitis severity in SCID mice compared with transfer of CD4(+) T cells alone.
Furthermore, molecular alterations in astrocyte TAAR1 levels correspond to changes in astrocyte EAAT-2 levels and function.
However, only CXCR4 and CCR5 were used to enter primary T cells and monocyte-derived macrophages, respectively.
Stromal cells such as mesangial cells, endothelial cells, and macrophages are sources of renal HGF; thus, HGF mediates epithelial-stromal and endothelial-mesangial interactions in the kidney.
More than 50% of these fetal cells expressed the CD34, CD31, or von Willebrand factor endothelial cell markers.
In cardiomyocytes and H9c2 cells, prokineticin-2 or overexpressing PKR1 activates Akt to protect cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress.
Interleukin-HP1 (HP1)/IL-6 is a 25-30-kD protein produced by macrophages, fibroblasts, and certain T cell lines.
RT-PCR analysis with primers targeted outside of the transmenbrane region revealed that membrane-anchored G-CSFR is expressed at all maturation stages of purified myeloid cells, including CD34+CD13+ cells (blasts), CD11b-CD15+ cells (promyelocytes or myelocytes), CD11b+CD15+ cells (metamyelocytes and mature neutrophils), and CD14+ cells (monocytes).
CXCL8, CXCL6, CCL3, CCL20, CCL22) and B-cell activating cytokines (i.e.
For testing platelet-leukocyte-conjugates, antibodies against CD45, CD14 and CD41 were used.
The recruitment and enhanced production and function of granulocytic and phagocytic cells involves a number of T-lymphocyte PRFs including GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-5, IL-4, and IL-6.
Expression of interleukin-8 receptors (CXCR1, CXCR2) and CD14 of circulating neutrophils and monocytes was assessed by flow cytometry.
Nephrin forms a complex with adherens junction proteins and CASK in podocytes and in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells expressing nephrin.
Distinct functions of Vav1 in JNK1 activation in Jurkat T cells versus non-haematopoietic cells.
Our study demonstrates a T cell intrinsic role for Adam10 in activation of Notch1 during thymocyte development.
