MSX2 in ameloblast cell fate and activity.
Antibodies directed specifically to Cx43 protein confirmed the expression of macrophage gap junction protein in these cells.
The expression levels of COL2A1 and COL10A1 genes were higher in cultured chondrocytes than in situ chondrocytes; moreover, the expression of COL1A1 was almost undetectable on cultured chondrocytes; likewise, COL2 and SOX9 proteins were detected by immunofluorescence.
Strong adhesion between L-selectin-positive and CD11a+ intravascular mononuclear cells and CD34+ and intercellular adhesion molecule 1-positive endothelial cells were observed.
Stk38 knockdown resulted in decreased Rbm24 protein level in cardiomyocytes.
Macrophages as APC and the dendritic cell myth.
However, in contrast to radiosensitive Atm-/- fibroblasts and radioresistant Atm-/- neurons, survival of Atm-/- astrocytes after IR was similar to wild-type astrocytes.
Relative expression of Tet1, BDNF, NTF3, A20, FLIP, HSP70, HSP90, HSP27, and Bcl2 in neuron-like cells was detected by qPCR.
Differential regulation of phagosome maturation in macrophages and dendritic cells mediated by Rho GTPases and ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins.
CXCR3 was co-localized with neuronal marker NeuN, while CXCL10 was derived from microglia.
Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a hemopoietic growth factor that is expressed in activated T cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and endothelial cells.
Mast cells are potent regulators of endothelial cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression.
p53, a transcriptional activator of caspase-6, is upregulated in neuronal cells and tissues expressing mutant huntingtin.
Median baseline lymphocyte CD4+ count was 385 (IQR:204-565) cells/?l and median nadir lymphocyte CD4+ count 197 (86-306) cells/?l.
Addition of insulin to hepatocytes maintained in hepatocytes.
Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) promotes keratinocyte cell attachment and migration on collagen and fibronectin.
The extent of microglia (CD11b/c-highly positive, CD45-slightly positive cell), macrophage (CD11b/c-highly positive, CD45-highly positive cell), lymphocyte (CD11b/c-negative, CD45-highly positive cell), and cytotoxic T-cell (CD8a-positive cell) infiltration into each rat's tumor, tumor periphery, and contralateral tumor-free hemisphere was analyzed using flow cytometry.
Levels of Lyn and Syk protein are similar in B cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils from releaser and nonreleaser donors.
These cells expressed PDGFR?, CD9, S100?, and SOX10 and mostly differentiated into GFAP-positive astrocytes and MBP-positive oligodendrocytes.
The upregulation of CD29 and VLA proteins only affected T lymphocytes (CD2+/CD8+/CD4+ cells).
