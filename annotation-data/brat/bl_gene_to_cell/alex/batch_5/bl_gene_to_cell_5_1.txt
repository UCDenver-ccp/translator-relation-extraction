Neural stem cells expressed nestin but not GFAP, while differentiated astrocytes were immunopositive for GFAP but displayed low levels of nestin expression.
Motor neuron progenitor markers (Olig2, Nkx6.1 and Pax6) and motor neuron markers (Isl1, Isl2 and Hb9) were expressed.
Immuhistochemical data revealed the presence of EAAT2 and EAAT3 surrounding noradrenergic neurons and EAAT2 on glial cells in the LC.
Ezrin-expressing lung adenocarcinoma cells and podoplanin-positive fibroblasts form a malignant microenvironment.
Most CCR4-expressing CD4+ T cells expressed both E-selectin ligand and cutaneous lymphocyte antigen.
RANKL is a transmembrane protein expressed in various cells type and particularly on osteoblast and activated T cells.
The osteoclast-like giant cells and some of the mononuclear cells are strongly positive for CD68, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin.
H(2)O(2) (200 microM) stimulated ERK1/2 and p90RSK activity in lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts.
Infected fibroblasts increased expression of mRNA coding for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.
We previously reported that aquaporin 4 (AQP4) has a neuroimmunological function via astrocytes and microglial cells involving osteopontin.
Sputum macrophages, as well as sputum neutrophils in neutrophilic asthma, expressed NLRP3 and caspase-1 protein.
Similarly, in the present study, vatalanib significantly increased CD68+ myeloid cells, and CD133+, CD34+ and Tie2+ endothelial cell signatures.
Effects of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) on protease production from monocyte, macrophage and foam cell in vitro: a possible mechanism for anti-atherosclerotic effect of M-CSF.
CD4+CXCR5+Tfh cells are significantly increased in salivary and peripheral blood in pSS patients with aberrant CD19+CD27+ memory B cells and CD19+CD27high plasma cells, suggesting that CD4+CXCR5+Tfh cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of pSS by promoting the maturation of B cells.
Fucoidan increases TNF-alpha-induced MMP-9 secretion in monocytic cell line U937.
In relation to the recovery of hematopoiesis, CD16+ lymphocyte (especially CD16+ CD57- lymphocyte) percentages at the third weeks correlated significantly to the recovery of granulocyte, reticulocyte, and platelet.
However, Thpp, Th1 and Th2 cells, but not naive cells, expressed several CC chemokines including CCL1/TCA3, CCL5/RANTES, CCL3/MIP-1 alpha, CCL4/MIP-1 beta, and CCL9/MIP-1 gamma.
We examined by flow cytometry, the proportion of CD4+ T cells and CD4+CD25highCD127low Treg cells as well as the expression of FoxP3, GITR, CTLA-4, and FAS by CD4+CD25highCD127low Treg cells.
BDNF treatment also promoted other phenotypic differentiation of striatal neurons: BDNF increased the frequency of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons and calbindin-immunoreactive neurons and neuropeptide content for neuropeptide Y and somatostatin.
Neuronal neurofibrillary tangles, plaque neurites, microglia, astrocytes and macrophages expressed TGF-beta 2 immunoreactivity.
