Total cell content of CR3 (CD11b/CD18) and LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) in neonatal neutrophils: relationship to gestational age.
We suggest that in neurons, just as in non-excitable cells, the STIM1 and ORAI1 proteins are involved in SOCE.
Differentiated cells express neuronal markers, including neurofilaments, neuron-specific enolase, and growth-associated protein-43 as well as neuronal polarity markers such as tau and microtubule-associated protein 2.
MBP + oligodendrocytes are differentiated from progenitor cells which express Olig2.
Fibulin-5 regulates keloid-derived fibroblast-like cells through integrin beta-1.
A crosstalk triggered by hypoxia and maintained by MCP-1/miR-98/IL-6/p38 regulatory loop between human aortic smooth muscle cells and macrophages leads to aortic smooth muscle cells apoptosis via Stat1 activation.
IL-6 alone does not induce any cytotoxicity from thymocytes nor does IL-6 change the time course of thymocyte-LAK cell generation in IL-2 culture.
The transition between fibroblast-like cells and ?-smooth muscle actin (SMA)+ MF possibly begins with CD14+ monocytes, evolving to CD14+ CD34+ fibrocytes, followed by ?-SMA+ protomyofibroblast (PMF) maturation.
Based on whole-cell recording of Kiss1-Cre-green fluorescent protein (GFP) neurons, INaP was 4-fold greater in AVPV/PeN vs ARC Kiss1 neurons.
However, KLRG1 ligation by E-cadherin inhibits effector T-cell function, whereas binding of CD103 to E-cadherin enhances cell-cell interaction and promotes target cell lysis.
CD14, CD16, CD33, CD45, and CD54 expression of adherent macrophages, were also evaluated to detect LPS activation of macrophages using flow cytometry.
TNF-alpha and TNFR1 overexpression and JNK/p38MAPK phosphorylation occurred in neurons and microglia in early symptomatic mice, suggesting that this activation may contribute to motor neuron damage.
Epithelial cells damaged or activated by the allergen produce IL-33, TSLP and IL-25, activating ILC2 and dendritic cells.
Immunofluorescent tissue analysis after TLR7 stimulation showed IL-10 expression in T cells, macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells.
IL-13 as well as IL-4 induces monocytes/macrophages and a monoblastic cell line (UG3) to differentiate into multinucleated giant cells in the presence of M-CSF.
CD5(+)CD19(+) B cell, CD5(+)CD43(+)CD19(+) B cell, and CD27(+)CD43(+) B cell counts were significantly lower in the patients with previous chronic GVHD, and this effect of GVHD was similar in both CD5(+) and CD5(-) within the CD27(+)CD43(+) B cell subset.
Neuregulin-1 increases connexin-40 and connexin-45 expression in embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.
LPCs from LPC0 to LPC2 presented a heterogeneous cell population, with cells positive for LESC markers K14, K15, ABCG2 and p63, differentiated corneal epithelial cell-specific markers K3 and K12, and for the fibroblast marker S100A4.
From these data we propose a model where the CD24(+) adipocyte progenitors become further committed to the adipocyte lineage as CD24 expression is lost, generating CD24(-) preadipocytes.
The trafficking kinetics of Glut4, the transferrin (Tf) receptor, and LRP1 were quantified in adipocytes and undifferentiated fibroblasts.
