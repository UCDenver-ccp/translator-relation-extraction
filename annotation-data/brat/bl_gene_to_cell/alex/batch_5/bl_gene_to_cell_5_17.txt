During NPC differentiation toward neurons, ETV5 represses NEUROG2 expression and blocks the appearance of glutamatergic neurons.
Differing numbers of CD68+ foam cells (15% to 60%) expressed E-cadherin but all the CD68+ macrophages without signs of transformation into foam cells were negative for E-cadherin.
Myd88(-/-) Kupffer cells, but not Trif(-/-) cells, exhibited normal caspase-1 activation upon TLR4 engagement in vitro.
Induction of hepatocyte-like cells from mouse embryonic stem cells by lentivirus-mediated constitutive expression of Foxa2/Hnf4a.
FGF10 influenced the expression of CTSB and SPRY2 in cumulus cells and BMP15 in oocytes.
IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-3, colony stimulating factor (CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF) caused significant histamine release from cells from a similar number of AIDS patients and controls.
Embryonic bone morphogenetic protein and nodal induce invasion in melanocytes and melanoma cells.
Second, the viruses replicated actively during the maturation of CD34+ stem cells toward CD1a+ DC and CD1a- CD14+ cells.
The VE-induced increase in the percentage of CD4+CD8- thymocytes was due to an increase in the TCR2+CD4+CD8- thymocyte subset, whereas the decrease in the percentage of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes involved all TCR defined T cell subsets.
Reg4+ deep crypt secretory cells function as epithelial niche for Lgr5+ stem cells in colon.
Dendritic cells regulate T-cell deattachment through the integrin-interacting protein CYTIP.
The monocyte/macrophage CD69 expression rate was significantly negatively correlated with the absolute value of CD4(+) T cells (r = -0.872,
CD4+CD25+ cells were 15 times more frequent in PBMC from patients than HC; the vast majority of these CD4+CD25+ cells were FOXP3-, and most of CD4+ T cells were CCR4+ and CCR9+ cells.
In the remaining cases TAL1 expression was restricted to a minor population (< 5%) of larger, strongly TAL1-positive cells which comprised erythroid cells, CD34+ CD3- precursors and an unidentified TAL1+ CD45- population which morphologically resembled monocytes/macrophages.
Smad3 null inflammatory cells and fibroblasts do not respond to the chemotactic effects of TGF-beta and do not autoinduce TGF-beta.
Nkx2.5/GATA4 expression in a subpopulation of resident neural stem cells provides the appropriate phenotype for their potential differentiation to a nestin+ cardiac myocyte-like cell.
Finally, overexpression of Ets-1 induced the expression of SERCA3 in endothelial cells and in fibroblasts.
Th1 cells produced IL-2, IFN-gamma and Lymphotoxin T (LT) and Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13.
P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), a sialomucin on human leukocytes, mediates rolling of leukocytes on P-selectin expressed by activated platelets or endothelial cells under shear forces.
Adipocyte SIRT1 controls systemic insulin sensitivity by modulating macrophages in adipose tissue.
