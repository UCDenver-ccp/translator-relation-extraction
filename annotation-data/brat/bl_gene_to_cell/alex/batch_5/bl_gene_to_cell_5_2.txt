Dectin-1 is a major beta-glucan receptor expressed in the innate immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells.
CD14 is present in macrophage, monocyte, and granulocyte cell membranes.
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) controls osteoblast cell cycle regulatory proteins and suppresses mature osteoblasts apoptosis.
Inflammatory cell infiltrate consisted of CD4-Mac1+ macrophages.
The expression of SIRT1 could be observed in neurons and microglia, and the enhanced SIRT1 was mainly located in neurons after SAH.
Overall, this indicates that Dok1 and Dok2 are novel adaptors for TLR2 in glial cells and importantly indicates that Dok1 and Dok2 differentially regulate TLR2-induced pro-inflammatory signaling in astrocytes and microglia.
Fixed prestimulated T cells induced monocytes to secrete both IL-10 and TNF-alpha, and in addition, enhanced LPS-stimulated monocyte production of IL-10 and TNF-alpha in a dose-dependent manner.
In addition, the relative density of calretinin-labeled neurons was approximately twice that of the calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive neurons.
In vitro MSC induced Foxp3+ T cells, and down-regulated IL-17+, IFN?+ T cells and pathogenic IL-17+IFN?+ or IL-17+Foxp3+ T cells.
In the CNS, the main producers of CCL11 were neurons, whereas CCR3 was detected on neurons and CSF producing ependymal cells.
In vitro, T lymphocyte transendothelial migration across PECAM-KO endothelial cells is enhanced, regardless of expression of PECAM-1 on transmigrating T cells.
CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cells as well as NK1.1(+) cells and CD11b(+) monocytes and macrophages did not express any detectable BDNF, NGF, NT-3, or trkB under any conditions.
Endothelin-1 mediates erythropoietin-stimulated glomerular endothelial cell-dependent proliferation of mesangial cells.
The expression of beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) by astrocytes is well documented; however, data concerning oligodendrocytes remain controversial.
Immature neuron and oligodendrocyte marker expression positively correlated with TGF? and ErbB4 mRNAs, whilst astrocyte transcripts positively correlated with EGF, FGF2, and FGFR1 mRNAs.
miR?153 promoted neural differentiation and protected neural cells by upregulating the neuron markers ??enolase, neuronal nuclei, and the functional proteins SNAP23, SNAP25 and PRX5.
IGF-1 suppressed THP-1 macrophage ability to oxidize lipids and form foam cells.
Mast cells, activated eosinophils, T cells, IL-4+ cells, IL-5+ cells, eotaxin+ cells, RANTES+ cells and CCR3+ cells were all increased in the lesions of KD as compared with those in normal tissue.
Follistatin-like protein 1 enhances NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1? secretion from monocytes and macrophages.
Robust expression of gdf9 and bmp15 in ectopic oocytes was associated with the surrounding Sertoli cells.
