Immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Iba1, an actin cross-linking molecule restricted to macrophages and microglia, was used to evaluate astrocytes and microglia, respectively.
K6PC-5 activates SphK1-Nrf2 signaling to protect neuronal cells from OGDR.
The multifunctional membrane protein CD36 is expressed on platelets, mature monocytes and macrophages, microvascular endothelial cells and mammary epithelial cells.
Regulation of phagocytic leukocyte activities by C-reactive protein.
These include makers for endothelial progenitor cells (CD146/MCAM/MUC18/S-endo-1, CD34, CD133/prominin, Tie-2, Flk1/KD/VEGFR2), hematopoietic stem cells (CD34, CD117/c-Kit, Sca1), mesenchymal stem cells (CD146/MCAM/MUC18/S-endo-1, STRO-1, Thy-1), neural stem cells (CD133/prominin, nestin, NCAM), mammary stem cells (CD24, CD29, Sca1), and intestinal stem cells (NCAM, CD34, Thy-1, CD117/c-Kit, Flt-3).
Isolation of apoptotic germ cells showed that even though protein levels of TACE/ADAM17 were higher in apoptotic germ cells than in nonapoptotic cells, the contrary was observed for ADAM10.
enhanced PPAR? protein expression in monocytes.
Astrocytes bound 40,000-100,000 EGF molecules per cell, while oligodendrocytes bound only 6,000-10,000 EGF molecules per cell.
In addition, CD40 activated endogenous GCKR in primary B cells, implicating GCK family proteins in CD40-mediated B-cell functions.
Moderate amounts of CD38+ and CD11c+ cells (macrophages) and few CD16+ and CD56+ lymphocytes were found in all cases.
When the monocyte-like THP-1 cells were induced to differentiate to adherent macrophages they started to express alpha 6 and beta 5 integrin subunits.
Cell counts were executed with white blood cells (WBC), lymphocytes, CD3(+) (T lymphocytes), CD4(+) (Helper T lymphocytes), CD8(+) (Cytotoxic T lymphocytes), CD21(+) (B lymphocytes) cells in addition to calculating CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio.
Here, several independent approaches show that GATA1 interacts with several proteins in the megakaryocyte cell line L8057 and in primary megakaryocytes.
This subset expressed both macrophage (CD14, CD33, CD68) and DC markers (CD205, CD209) and produced larger amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-23, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, than typical intestinal resident macrophages (CD14-CD33+ macrophages).
The effect of MSC treatment on neuroinflammation was analyzed by immunohistochemical analysis of astrocytes, microglia/macrophages, neutrophils and T lymphocytes and by measuring cytokine levels [interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-1?, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor-?, interferon-?, RANTES, macrophage chemotactic protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein 2 and transforming growth factor-?1] in brain homogenates.
In all brain regions examined, GLUT4 immunoreactivity was exclusively found in neurons, and GLUT4-immunoreactive cells were colocalized with neurons expressing GLUT3 mRNA.
CD14(+) monocytes cultured in the presence of TNF-alpha and GM-CSF converted to CD14(+) CD1a(low) adherent cells with little capacity to stimulate T cells.
Padi4 is mainly expressed in myeloid cells and granulocytes.
The T cell-secreted lymphokine interleukin 13 (IL-13) exerts pleiotropic effects on monocytes (Mphi) and B cells.
Under such conditions, microglia presented an antigen, myelin basic protein (MBP), to MBP-specific T-cell lines.
