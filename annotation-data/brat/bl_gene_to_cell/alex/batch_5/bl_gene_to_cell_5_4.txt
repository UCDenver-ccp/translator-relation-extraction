Gly1 amacrine cells constitute approximately 15% and Gly2 amacrine cells approximately 38% of all cells in the amacrine cell layer.
PEDF increased the levels of IL-10 mRNA and protein in THP-1 cells and human macrophages derived from peripheral monocytes.
T-regulatory (Treg, CD4+ FOXP3+) cells constitute a unique subpopulation of CD4+ T cells that inhibit T-cell responses and prevent disease development/exacerbation in models of autoimmunity.
IL-3, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor potentiate basophil mediator release stimulated by eosinophil granule major basic protein.
Our data represent evidence that, compared to CD14(++)CD16(-) monocytes, CD14(+)CD16(++) monocytes have an increased expression of smooth muscle cell-associated genes.
Expression of OPG protein and RANKL protein in MG63 osteoblast-like cells, and expression of RANK protein in RAW264.
Sortilin was found to bind with ABCA1 protein and suppress macrophage ABCA1 expression, resulting in a decrease in cholesterol efflux from macrophages.
These data indicate that TGF-beta 1 exerts its inhibition on cell cycling independent of p21 and p27 in hematopoietic cells.
In RA patients, the percentage of CD18+ lymphocytes was decreased and that of CD11b+ neutrophils was increased.
While CD14++ CD16- monocytes showed no difference, CD14++ CD16+ and CD14+ CD16++ monocytes showed a strong increase of TGFb abundance.
ICAM-1 (CD54) plays an important role in the cell-cell interaction and migration of leukocytes.
By applying neutralizing antibodies against CCL2/MCP-1 and using CCR2-deficient monocytes, we confirmed CCL2/MCP-1 as the exclusive factor secreted by nef-expressing astrocytes capable of attracting monocytes.
TLR2 and TNF-alpha transcripts were expressed mainly in microglia/macrophages.

To investigate the distribution of T-lymphocyte subsets (CD4+ and CD8+ cells) and the expression of IL-5 and IL-10 protein-positive cells in nasal polyps.
Ligation of CD31/PECAM-1 modulates the function of lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils.
Double immunostaining with LN-1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) clearly distinguished LN-1-positive microglia and GFAP-positive astrocytes.
Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is known to stimulate granulocytes, monocytes, and macrophages.
WB-F344 cells, a hepatocytic precursor cell line, also expressed Gas6 and Axl.
