The expression of two adhesion molecules, ICAM1 (CD54) and ICAM3 (CD50), infiltrating cells positive for their ligand, LFA1 (CD11a), and the markers of total leukocytes (CD45), T cells (CD3), granulocytes/monocytes (CD15), and macrophages (CD68) in renal interstitium were examined by an indirect immunoperoxidase method.
Regulatory T cells express higher levels of RGS1, RGS9 and RGS16 than naive cells.
The MS findings were completely verified for neuronal SAHH2 and SRSF1 whereas the presence in both cell types of GABT and EAA2 was only validated in neurons.
dsRNA activates epithelial cells and dendritic cells in different directions, resulting in allergy-related Th2-skewing tendency in epithelial cells, and Th1-skewing tendency in dendritic cells.
The cumulative incidence of diabetes was monitored until 30weeks of age, islet histology was examined, and lymphocytes including T cells, B cells, CD4+ IFN-?+ cells, CD8+ IFN-?+ cells, CD4+ IL-4+ cells, and regulatory T cells were analyzed.
A conditionally immortalized human podocyte cell line demonstrating nephrin and podocin expression.
As the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins are expressed in the microvilli of many epithelial cells, we have examined the expression and distribution of these proteins in Schwann cells and neurons in vitro and in vivo.
TGF-beta 1 selectively induced clusterin mRNA in astrocytes, as no clusterin mRNA was detected in neurons, oligodendrocytes, or microglia.
Intriguingly, FOXO3 inhibits ASCL1-dependent neurogenesis in NPCs and direct neuronal conversion in fibroblasts.
Amounts of beta-actin decrease and gamma-actin increase in the order, outer pillar cells, inner pillar cells, Deiters' cells and hair cells.
Differential expression of Fas antigen and Bcl-2 protein on CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and monocytes.
Confocal microscopy confirmed that HGF/SF could be found in both GFAP positive astrocytes and LN3 positive microglia cells, as well as rare scattered cortical neurons.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed that most of these cells displayed a T-cell phenotype with important proportions of regulatory T cells (CD3+/CD4+/FOXP3+) and mast cells.
TMAO treatment significantly increased the colocalization of NLRP3 with Asc or NLRP3 with caspase-1, caspase-1 activity, IL-1? production, cell permeability in carotid artery endothelial cells (CAECs) compared to control cells.
Further, we demonstrate that p70 is the principal IL-2 binding protein on both resting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and that both p70 and p55 can be induced on normal B cells and monocytes.
Matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP-7), or matrilysin, is a secreted protease expressed by glandular and mucosal epithelial cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts and macrophages.
In macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-deficient osteopetrotic mice, monocytes, tissue macrophages and osteoclasts are deficient.
Many cells expressed neuronal markers including nestin, beta-tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins.
Sections were double-labeled for markers selective for neurons (NeuN), astrocytes (GFAP), olidgodendrocytes (CNPase and MBP) and macrophage/microglia (ED1).
P450scc immunoreactivity was present in Purkinje neurons expressing either of the neuronal microtubule associated proteins MAP1b/5 or MAP2a/b, but was absent from GFAP and HNK-1 positive cells.
