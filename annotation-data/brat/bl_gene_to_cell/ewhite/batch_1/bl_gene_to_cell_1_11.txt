mice, carbonylated proteins, GPx-1 and GPx-4 expression were mainly detected in podocytes and mesangial cells.
Here we show, with global proteomic analysis of macrophage cell lines treated with either IFN? or IL-4, that PARP9 and PARP14 regulate macrophage activation.
Furthermore, MSRB2 expression was found in melanocytes while MSRB1 and MSRB3 were both expressed within vascular endothelial cells.
The main cellular sources of interleukin-5 (IL-5) are T lymphocytes and mast cells.
All HR6 cells coexpressed the "sensory neuron membrane protein 1" (SNMP1) and were associated with supporting cells expressing the pheromone-binding proteins PBP1 and PBP2.
E-cadherin, a protein responsible for intercellular adhesion between epithelial cells, is also expressed in the monocyte/macrophage lineage.
The generation of subtypes of neurons was directed by the force expression of cell-type specific TFs Lhx8 or Foxa2/Lmx1a.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes neuronal survival and protection against neuronal damage.
FTY treatment decreased IL-6 and TNF-alpha expression in synovial fibroblast cells and the number of inflammatory cells overall.
Neo1 expression was limited to Neo1-expressing Ly6Chi monocytes, and Neo1 deficiency induced monocyte polarization toward an antiinflammatory and proresolving phenotype.
In cultured endothelial cells and macrophages, addition of Lp(a) increased mRNA of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin and MCP-1 in endothelial cells and TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and MCP-1 in macrophages in a dose-dependent manner.
Integrin alpha1beta1 is abundant on smooth muscle cells, whereas the alpha2beta1 integrin is the major collagen receptor on epithelial cells and platelets.
Microinjection of Rho GDI, a negative regulator of the Rho family members, into Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells resulted in perturbation of epithelial cell morphology and of cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesions, and comicroinjection of dominant active Cdc42 or Rac1 reversed the action of Rho GDI, suggesting that the active form of Cdc42 or Rac1 is required for maintaining the cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesions.
Meanwhile, Iba1(+) microglia and GFAP(+) astrocyte cells were significantly (P<0.05)
Granulocyte-macrophage colony formation by C57BL bone marrow cells was initiated in agar cultures either by the granulocyte-macrophage stimulus, GM-CSF, or by the predominantly macrophage stimulus, M-CSF.
Immunohistochemical staining showed that the GFP signals were detected in GFAP positive astrocytes, NeuN positive neurons, and Calbindin positive purkinje cells.
Neither non-resorptive cells (macrophages, UMR 106 cells), nor osteoclasts prevented from resorption by calcitonin, showed evidence of cytotoxicity after incubation on bone slices with Cl2MBP.
Our results show that neutrophils, monocytes and NK cells express higher levels of both AnxA1 and FPR2/ALX compared to T or B cells.
Stimulation of hemopoietic cells with IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, granulocyte-macrophage-CSF and Steel factor-(SLF) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of protein substrates.
A similar induction was also observed for IL-1beta, IL-6, colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1, and granulocyte macrophage-CSF.
