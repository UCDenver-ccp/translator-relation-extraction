To elucidate how Rac1 is regulated in platelets, we captured Rac1-interacting proteins from platelets and identified Rac1-associated proteins by mass spectrometry.
Cocultures of both MSCs with CD4+ T-cells resulted in recruitment of CD45RA+ FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells.
During endotoxin activation of PGS2 expression in healthy monocytes, granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is activated and, in turn, promotes PGS2 gene activation.
Innate lymphoid cell type 3-derived interleukin-22 boosts lipocalin-2 production in intestinal epithelial cells via synergy between STAT3 and NF-?B.
BAL neutrophils were as prevalent as monocytes/macrophages or epithelial cells, and immunohistochemistry revealed that neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and epithelial cells were major sources of the IP-10 and IL-7.
Transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into induced neuronal cells (iNs) by the neuron-specific transcription factors Brn2, Myt1l, and Ascl1 is a paradigmatic example of inter-lineage conversion across epigenetically distant cells.
Insulin cell mass is altered in Csf1op/Csf1op macrophage-deficient mice.
These converted cells expressed the cell markers SSEA-1, SSEA-4, NCAM and Thy-1 glycoconjugates of NSC and neurons, and differentiating cells showed characteristic neuronal morphology.
Furthermore, we found that oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and ependymal cells also express BMP6 protein.
Thus it appears that in both murine and human lymphocytes, p64 and p58 served as T-cell-specific substrates, while p61 and p55 were specifically associated with B lymphocytes.
Increased TLR4-dependent expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) was also observed in endothelial cells and macrophages.
CD4+ nadir lymphocytes; 96.6% had VL < 50?copies/mL and 674?cells/?L CD4+ lymphocytes.
HDAC5 shRNA increases, whereas HDAC5 overexpression decreases SOST expression in the novel murine Ocy454 osteocytic cell line.
Supernatants from HMEC-1 exposed only to Stx2 exhibited enhanced exposure of platelet P-selectin and platelet-THP-1 cell interactions.
Endothelial-monocyte activating polypeptide II (EMAP II) and allograft-inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1) are two proteins produced by activated monocytes and microglial cells.
Seven different cell-specific markers were used to characterize proliferating cells as oligodendrocytes (myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, galactocerebroside, CNPase), astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein), microglia/macrophages (Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4) or T-lymphocytes (CD3).
We found a numeric decrease in helper T cells (higher in CD4(+)CD45RA(+) than in CD4(+)CD29(+)) and B cells, and a rise in activated, CD4(+)CD25(+) lymphocytes that was correlated with lymphocyte depletion.
The MCPIP-1 protein level was higher in epithelial cells than in myeloid cells.
Single oocyte-like cells expressed genes OCT4A, SOX-2, NANOG, NANOS, STELLA, CD9, LIN28, KLF4, GDF3, and MYC, characteristic for pluripotent stem cells.
Granulocyte-macrophage CSF was optimally induced by IL-15 and IL-18.
