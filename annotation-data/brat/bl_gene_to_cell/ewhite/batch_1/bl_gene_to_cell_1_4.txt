Intriguingly, mammalian sperm could fuse with skeletal myoblasts, requiring PtdSer on sperm and BAI1/3, ELMO2, RAC1 in myoblasts.
Our results show that B-CLL cells but not normal B cells constitutively express Notch1 and Notch2 proteins as well as their ligands Jagged1 and Jagged2.
In addition to induction of CCL2 and CCL7 in both preadipocytes and adipocytes, EGF enhanced specifically CXCL1 and CXCL5 in adipocytes, indicating the potentiation of CXCR2-mediated pathway in adipocytes.
Sfxn3 protein level is much higher in neurons than in astrocytes.
Interestingly, Cx30 was mostly present between ciliated cells whereas Cx31 was found between basal cells.
Tropoelastin (TE), the soluble monomer of elastin, is synthesized by elastogenic cells, such as chondrocytes, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells (SMCs).
Human monocytes are a heterogeneous cell population classified into three different subsets: Classical CD14++CD16-, intermediate CD14++CD16+, and non-classical CD14+CD16++ monocytes.
We did not find any differences in ratios of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells or CD8+CD28- T cells in lymphocytes between patients and healthy subjects.
Neurons from EGF/FGF-2 neurospheres also contained smaller populations of calbindin- and calretinin-positive interneuron-like cells.
After LNT treatment, CD4+ IFN-gamma+ T-cell percentages increased significantly (p < 0.05), whereas CD4+ IL-4+ T-cell and CD4+ IL-6+ T-cell percentages decreased significantly (p < 0.02).
Increased expression levels of TNFR1 and TNFR2 were also detected on leukocytes, particularly on lymphocytes and monocytes.
Nevertheless, MGC formation from monocytes was enhanced by adding either macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), MGC formations from macrophages were observed only when macrophages were cultured with GM-CSF plus CM.
Expression of TRPV4, TRPV6 and TRPM6 was significantly higher in epithelial cells whereas TRPV2, TRPC1/4 and TRPC6 were almost exclusively expressed in stromal cells.
Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) is an extremely potent chemoattractant for macrophages, mononuclear leukocytes, and fibroblasts.
The stem cell-enriched CD34+/CD38+ and CD34+/CD38- fractions of AML cells were found to express Hsp32 mRNA in excess over normal CD34+ progenitor cells.
We found that genetic STAT3 haplodeficiency in macrophages attenuated macrophage activation, complete STAT3 deficiency increased macrophage activation through compensatory upregulation of STAT1 signaling, and deficiency in C/EBP? or HIF1 attenuated fibroblast-driven macrophage activation.
In FTS culture, CD34(+)CLA(+) cells produced greater absolute numbers of CD34(+) cells, granulocyte-macrophage-, erythroid-, and DC (including Langerhans cell-related) progenitors compared to CD34(+)CLA(-) cells.
2. Of the haematopoietic cell lines tested, promonocytic U937 cells express P2Y2 and P2Y6, but not P2Y1 or P2Y4; promyelocytic HL-60 cells express the P2Y1, P2Y2 and P2Y6 receptors but not the P2Y4 receptor; K562 cells express P2Y1 but not P2Y2, P2Y4 or P2Y6; and Dami cells express P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4 and P2Y6 receptors.
Knockdown of SOX6 in proliferating ATDC5 cells significantly repressed the stimulation of osteoblast multiplication, whereas depletion of RUNX2 in hypertrophic ATDC5 cells retarded the expression of osteoblastic markers.
Renal cells and inflammatory cells also express chemokine receptors, especially CCR-5, CCR-1, CCR-2, and CXCR3.
