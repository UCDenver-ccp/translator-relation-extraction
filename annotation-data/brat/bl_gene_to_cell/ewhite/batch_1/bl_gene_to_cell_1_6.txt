Stimulation of CD4+ T cells with allogeneic dendritic cells resulted in the formation of three distinguishable populations: CD44+, CD44++ and CD44+++.
Since the myoglobin-ferritin conjugate serves for myoglobin-specific T cells to help myoglobin-specific B cells, the myoglobin in the conjugate is not altered in a way that would prevent recognition by myoglobin-specific B cells.
The identified TLR8 RNA motifs signal via TLR8 and fail to induce IFN-alpha from TLR7-expressing plasmacytoid dendritic cells but induce the secretion of Th1-like and proinflammatory cytokines from TLR8-expressing immune cells such as monocytes or myeloid dendritic cells.
Quantification of MSX2 mRNA in primary hematopoietic cells demonstrated higher levels in CD34+ stem cells as compared to peripheral blood cells and mature CD3+ T-cells.
Binding of bone marrow cells to platelets involves both P-selectin and GPIIb integrin on platelets.
The comparatively low incidence of alpha1-M staining thymocytes, together with the presence of alpha1-M on glass-adherent cells and on leucocytes from congenitally athymic rats, suggest that this protein is associated predominantly with B cells and monocytes.
Since memory CD4(+) T cells can be generated from effector CD4(+) T cells, properties of Bcl6-deficient effector CD4(+) T cells were compared with those wild-type effector CD4(+) T cells 10 days after immunization.
Positive selection by use of MACS? Technology coupled to transcriptomics was assessed for eight different peripheral blood cell types, CD14+ monocytes, CD3+, CD4+, or CD8+ T cells, CD15+ granulocytes, CD19+ B cells, CD56+ NK cells, and CD45+ pan leukocytes.
Potent inhibition of sulfatase activity could be achieved by directly exposing murine macrophages to interferon-alpha (IFN alpha), IFN beta, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha, but not interleukin-1, interleukin-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, transforming growth factor-beta, platelet-derived growth factor, or the T-cell product IFN gamma.
Microtubule-associated protein 2(MAP2), a cytoskeletal protein of the neuron, is a marker of early ischemic neuronal damage.
ADAM3 is barely present in Adam2-null sperm, despite normal levels of this protein in Adam2-null testicular germ cells (TGCs; sperm precursor cells).
C-reactive protein, white blood cell and platelet count.
In addition, CD34+ hematopoietic cells, monocytes (CD68+ cells), and myofibroblasts (alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive [alpha-SMA+] cells) were counted.
Cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes secrete chemerin protein, which triggers CMKLR1 signaling in adipocytes and other cell types and stimulates chemotaxis of CMKLR1-expressing cells.
TNP-470 also decreased the number of VEGF-expressing cells, myofibroblasts, macrophages, PCNA-positive cells, and Cdk2-expressing cells.
IFNAR2 was detected in most lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes, although IFNAR2 expression was higher in the monocytes and granulocytes than in the lymphocytes.
Helper T cells can be divided into Th1 type cell which produces IL-2 and IFN-gamma and Th2 type cell which produces IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6.
In addition, diffuse sheets of rhabdoid cells were immunopositive for vimentin, nestin, neuron-specific enolase, and INI1.
AQP7 was expressed abundantly by round and elongated spermatids and ejaculated spermatozoa, AQP8 by all germ cells and spermatozoa, and AQP9 rarely by spermatocytes or Sertoli cells.
When cultured on MS-5 stromal cells in the presence of stem cell factor, Flt3-L, interleukin 7 (IL-7), and IL-3, isolated CD34+ cells differentiated into lymphoid (B and natural killer cells) as well as myeloid (macrophages and granulocytes) lineages.
