In addition, the AdIGF-I-MSCs cell-free supernatant induced the expression of IGF-I and HGF in primary cultured hepatocytes.
In contrast, tumor-exposed, IL-2/CD40-stimulated macrophages rescued elderly-derived T cell IFN-? production, suggesting that IL-2/CD40-activated macrophages could rescue T cell immunity in aging hosts.
The following parameters were determined: IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C4, granulocytes (CD11c), lymphocytes, B lymphocytes (CD19, CD19-CD15), T lymphocytes (CD3), T helper cells (CD3-CD4), T suppressor cells (CD3-CD8), CD4/CD8 ratio, NK cells (CD16), monocytes (CD14, CD11c-CD14), IL-2 receptor expression (CD25), HLA-DR expression (total HLA-DR, HLA-CD3), total cytotoxic activity (CD57), T cell cytotoxic activity (CD8-CD57), and NK cell cytotoxic activity (CD16-CD57).
Fibroblasts and histiocytes revealed diffuse positive immunostaining for vimentin and focal immunostaining for cytokeratin and desmin.
CD74-silenced macrophages showed that the adhesion molecules ALCAM, ICAM4, and Syndecan-2, as well as macrophage adhesion to trophoblasts were diminished.
Background: Epithelial cells typically express E-cadherin where as N-cadherin expressed by mesenchymal cells.
In vitro, endogenous Lmnb1 depletion favors NSC differentiation into glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive cells over neurons, while overexpression of human Lamin B1 (LMNB1) increases the proportion of neurons.
CD163 positive macrophages and glycophorin A (a protein specific to erythrocytes) were determined immunohistochemically.
The majority of these cells expressed the early neuronal protein betaIII-tubulin upon FACS; within the week thereafter, most matured as morphologically evident neurons that coexpressed betaIII-tubulin and microtubule-associated protein (MAP)-2.
They show that myoblasts with a normal dystrophin gene can restore dystrophin expression in dystrophin-deficient myoblasts.
Moreover, astrocytes (GFAP(+) cells) as well as microglia and macrophages (Iba1(+) cells) were important sources of IL-27.
Orc2, Orc3, and Orc5 also are detected in non-proliferating cells like cardiac myocytes, adrenal cortical cells, and neurons, suggesting an additional role of these proteins in non-proliferating cells.
CB CD34+CD38- cells cultured on MSCs generated higher proportions of CD34+CD38- HPCs and colony-forming cells than those cultures on a layer of adipocytes, indicating an inferior hematopoietic support by adipocytes.
Differential regulation of chemokine CCL5 expression in monocytes/macrophages and renal cells by Y-box protein-1.
PEP7 induced production of osteoblast-specific proteins in MG-63 cells.
Leucocytes express L-selectin, activated platelets express P-selectin, and activated endothelial cells express E- and P-selectin.
TGF-beta induces fibroblast activation protein expression; fibroblast activation protein expression increases the proliferation, adhesion, and migration of HO-8910PM [corrected].
Embryonic Cells Redistribute SUMO1 upon Forced SUMO1 Overexpression.
In nasal lavage, interleukin-8 (IL-8), albumin, total cell number, and percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and epithelial cells were determined.
We propose that TREM-1 activation orchestrates monocyte/macrophage proinflammatory responses and foam cell formation through coordinated and combined activation of CD36 and TLR4.
