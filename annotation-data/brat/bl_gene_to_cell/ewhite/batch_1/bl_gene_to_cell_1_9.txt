The number of multipotential progenitors (colony-forming units-granulocyte/erythroid/ macrophage/megakaryocyte [CFU-GEMM]) detected in CD34+d/d cells was twice that observed in CD34+HLA-DR- cells and eight times that in CD34+b/b cells.
IFNgamma partially supported survival of wildtype neurons but supported survival of SOCS1 null neurons as effectively as NGF or LIF.
This study was to explore whether sorting SP could enrich for the Musashi1 (Msi1) positive cells from Msi1 high expression cells (Msi1(high) cells) derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in vitro.
The B cell leukemia 11A protein (BCL11A/Evi9/CTIP1) has been implicated in hematopoietic cell development and malignancies.
RT-PCR analysis of microdissected DRG neurons and of the sensory neuronal cell line F11 confirmed the neuronal expression of TNFR1 and excluded that of TNFR2.
In wound situ, the fibroblasts, mononuclear phagocytes and endothelial cells expressed IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha after the firearm.
Within the lymphoid compartment, T cells appear to express high level of TIPE2 protein, while B cells and B cell zones of lymphoid organs were devoid of TIPE2.
Chemokine CCL2/MCP-1 is known to attract CCR2(+) monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs).
IL-3 and IL-4 also induced IL-33 introcrine in the peritoneal exudate cells from the macrophage-deficient op/op mice, suggesting that macrophage is not the only target of IL-3 and IL-4 in the heterogeneous peritoneal exudate cells.
RBP4 effects are markedly attenuated in JNK1-/- JNK2-/- macrophages and TLR4-/- macrophages.
High levels of circulating CD4+/CD25+/LAG-3+/FoxP-3+ immunoregulatory T cells were present before, during and after treatment and in vitro removal of these cells increased the antileukemic T-cell reactivity.
Rhbdd3 inhibits TLR3-triggered IFN-? and granzyme B expression of NK cells in cell-cell contact dependence of accessory cells such as dendritic cells and Kupffer cells.
We detected expression of CXCR4, but not CXCR2, in all PaCa cells and fibroblasts.
Furthermore, macrophages expressed CD44 and ALDH1.
Like CSF-1, IL-34 promotes the differentiation and survival of monocyte, macrophages and osteoclasts.
Hepatocytes degraded approximately four times more insulin than Kupffer cells, while endothelial cells degraded only negligible amounts of insulin.
IL-6 alone also had no effect on ICAM-1 expression in either astrocytes or microglia, but it inhibited induction of both ICAM-1 mRNA and protein expression in these cells.
APCs were obtained incubating peritoneal monocyte-macrophage cells with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (immature APCs) or GM-CSF and IFNgamma (mature APCs).
Nearly all CD19(+) B cells and CD19(+)CD27(+) memory B cells expressed BAFF-R.
Connexin 43 is expressed by macrophages, neutrophils and mast cells.
