Conversely, TLR8 agonists directly activated purified myeloid dendritic cells, monocytes, and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (GM-CSF/IL-4/TGF-beta).
ICAM-1 and LFA-1 mediated the enhanced adherence of neutrophils to hypoxia/reoxygenation cardiomyocytes.
Cultured mesangial cells expressed TLR1-4 and TLR6, while murine macrophages expressed TLR1-9.
Stimulated endothelial cells and activated platelets express P-selectin, which reacts with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) for leukocyte rolling on the stimulated endothelial cells and heterotypic aggregation of the activated platelets on leukocytes.
Thus, NFAT2, GATA-3, and Stat6 have surprisingly different roles in NKT cells than in conventional T cells.
The effects of HIV-Tat treatment, namely MMP-9 production, enhanced monocyte/endothelial cell adhesion, and monocyte-dependent endothelial damage, were mimicked by treating the monocytes with IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha, but not with IL-6 or IL-8.
In the immune system, neuropilins (NRPs), including NRP-1 and NRP-2, are expressed in thymocytes, dendritic cells, regulatory T cells and macrophages.
The chemokine receptors CXCR5 and CCR7 are principal regulators for targeting T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells into secondary lymphoid organs.
Endothelial sprouts were guided by CD31+/CD34+/CD105+/vimentin+ endothelial tip cells.
CD34-positive, but vWF-negative endothelial cells were observed, particularly in the sinusoids and vascular endothelial cells.
Immunohistochemistry was performed using anti-CD68 (macrophages), CD45 (leukocytes) and CD31 (endothelial cells) antibodies to assess inflammation.
TLR8-mediated NF-kappaB and IRF7 activation are abolished in human IRAK-deficient 293 cells and IRAK4-deficient fibroblast cells.
Moreover, IFN-?+?cells were increased among CXCR3+CD8+ T cells compared to CXCR3-CD8+ T cells (CXCR3+CD8+ T cell, 28.0???4.2% vs. CXCR3-CD8+ T cell, 9.5???1.5%, P?=?0.016).
HIV infects CD4(+) macrophages and lymphocytes.
Abundant expression of CXCL9 (MIG) by stromal cells that include dendritic cells and accumulation of CXCR3+ T cells in lymphocyte-rich gastric carcinoma.
Chondrocyte-osteoblast co-culture assay further revealed that Fgfr3 deficiency in chondrocytes promoted differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts by up-regulating the expressions of Ihh, Bmp2, Bmp4, Bmp7, Wnt4, and Tgf-?1, as well as down-regulating Nog expression.
Early neurons of the rostral tegmentum co-express Brn3.0 and Lim1/2, and caudal tegmental neurons express Islet1/2.
All of the participating cell types, lymphocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts have receptors for TGF-beta and many of them secrete TGF-beta as well.
Short half-lives of ataxia-associated aprataxin proteins in neuronal cells.
Activation of TLR4 by LPS increases the expression of chemokines IL-8 and CXCL10, which recruit leukocytes and activated T-cells, respectively.
