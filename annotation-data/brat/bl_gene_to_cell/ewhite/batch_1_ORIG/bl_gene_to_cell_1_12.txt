CD19, CD20, CD22 and CD79a.PAX-5 protein, also known as B-cell-specific activation protein is a B-cell-specific
In the present study, we demonstrated that APCs could also be converted into functional neurons using the three transcriptional factors (Ascl1, Brn2, Myt1l) that could convert fibroblasts into neurons.
The absolute counts of CD14+ macrophages/monocytes and CD23+ macrophages/monocytes were high, and were positively correlated during the acute stage of KD.
Immunohistochemistry revealed expression of COX-2 protein in neuronal and glial cells.
Wear particles are recognized by monocytes/macrophages through TLRs coupled with the adaptor protein MyD88.
Surprisingly, T cells selectively deficient in TORC1 do not divert to a regulatory T cell pathway, implicating both TORC1 and TORC2 in preventing the generation of regulatory T cells.
Human monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood by positive selection for CD14 expression and cultured with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), to obtain M-CSF-induced macrophages (M-M?).
Thus, resting and activated human astrocytes express preferentially TLR3 and, upon TLR3 engagement, produce IL-6 and chemokines active on T cells, B cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells.
Chemoattraction of T cells expressing CCR5, CXCR3 and CX3CR1 by proximal tubular epithelial cell chemokines.
The HO-1 was induced primarily in microglia/macrophages.
The results showed that NK cells expressed all these proteins, while NK cell-deprived peripheral blood leukocytes and purified T lymphocytes did not express radixin.
Therefore, overexpression of SOCS3 in adipocytes causes local adipocyte insulin resistance, but it is not sufficient to cause systemic insulin resistance.
In contrast, histone H4 K16 acetylation was found to be markedly higher in dendritic cells than in monocytes and macrophages.
Sox17, GATA4, GATA6, FoxA2, HEX, HNF4? and C/EBP? were expressed in fetal and adult liver cells, but not in iPS cells.
A significant morphological and numerical correlation between CD3, CXCR3, and CCR5-positive cells indicated a CXCR3/CCR5 double-positive T cell population.
Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF), also known as CSF2, and granulocyte CSF, also known as CSF3, are important survival and proliferation factors for neutrophils and macrophages.
FCN1 expression by isolated monocytes and granulocytes and ficolin-1 levels in monocyte culture supernatants were assessed in 21 FCN1-genotyped individuals.
Cultured microglial cells expressed CD68, a monocyte marker.
Connexins are proteins that form gap junctions, and connexin 43 (Cx43) is present in macrophages, lymphoid cells, myelogenous cells, fibroblasts and others.
A1 hybrid neurons express neuron-specific markers such as neurofilament-L (NF-L), NF-M, NF-H, MAP-2, and beta tubulin III.
