Bcl-2 protein varied in plasma cell dyscrasias.
TLR7 expression on antigen-presenting cells is detected in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD34+-derived dendritic cells, and B-cells, whereas TLR8 is mainly expressed on cells of the myeloid lineage, such as monocytes, macrophages, and myeloid dendritic cells.
Furthermore, we found that oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and ependymal cells also express myostatin protein.
CCR7+ myeloid dendritic cells together with CCR7+ T cells and CCR7+ macrophages invade CCL19+ nonnecrotic muscle fibers in inclusion body myositis.
Dendritic cells generated from CD34+ progenitor cells with flt3 ligand, c-kit ligand, GM-CSF, IL-4, and TNF-alpha are functional antigen-presenting cells resembling mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells.
Here we demonstrate IL-4 induction of both IL-25 and IL-17Rb protein in human lung tissue culture, primary alveolar macrophages, and the THP-1 monocytic cell line.
may protect SH-SY5Y cells against 6-OHDA-induced cell injury and that gene expression of SLC41A1, NIPA1, MagT1, and CNNM2 might be involved in dopaminergic neurons.
They expressed typical neural stem/progenitor cell markers, including Sox2, vimentin, and nestin, and differentiated into mature neurons and glial cells.
Immature DC were generated by incubation of peripheral blood monocytes with interleukin-4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor for 7 days and were characterized by a CD1a+/CD40+/CD80+/CD86+/HLA-DR+/CD14- phenotype.
CD34+ mononuclear cells cultured with stem cell factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-3, and IL-5 in Iscove's MEM, and proliferated until the 2nd week, when the cell number reached a plateau.
TSST-1-activated T cells consisted of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, indicating that TSST-1 activates these two T-cell subsets.
Further study in Smad3-deficient fibroblasts demonstrates that p38 and ERK1/2 could be activated by TGF-beta1 and result in fibroblast differentiation.
Binding of lactoferrin and transferrin to the human promonocytic cell line U937.
Both cell lines expressed stem cell markers (CD44, SOX2 and BMI1), mesenchymal cell markers (CDH2, VIM and SNAI2) and a neurogenic marker?(NEFL).
By contrast, astrocytes have low APC/C-Cdh1 activity and therefore Pfkfb3 is present in these cells.
WIF-1 knockdown, either in fibroblasts or in keratinocytes, significantly stimulated tyrosinase expression and melanosome transfer, whereas melanocytes with WIF-1 overexpression significantly reduced those parameters.
Recombinant porcine granulocyte monocyte-colony stimulating factor (reporGM-CSF) protein was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9) cells using baculovirus expression system.
Anti-SR-PSOX/CXCL16 and anti-CXCR6 antibody block monocyte adhesion, showing that SR-PSOX/CXCL16-CXCR6 interaction mediates monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion.
Furthermore, Brn-2 and Tst-1/SCIP expression was restricted to the RT4 stem cell line and glial derivative, while Oct-2 was expressed predominantly by the RT4 stem cell line and neuronal derivatives.
Platelet alpha2-macroglobulin and alpha1-antitrypsin.
