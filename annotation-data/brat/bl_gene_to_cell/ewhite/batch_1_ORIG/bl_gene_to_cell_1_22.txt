Moreover, Wnt3a, ?-catenin, and Cyclin D1 were also expressed in both neurons and astrocytes.
Oocyte regulation of metabolic cooperativity between mouse cumulus cells and oocytes: BMP15 and GDF9 control cholesterol biosynthesis in cumulus cells.
IL-6 or IL-6/sIL-6R dose-dependently inhibited inward TRPM7 currents, in both primary cultured neurons and HEK293 cells overexpressing TRPM7.
We analyzed CD14+ monocyte HLA-DR expression, lymphocyte immunophenotypes, the proportion of CD4+CD25+ Foxp3high regulatory T cells (Treg cells) and Th17 cells, cytokines (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-10, TGF-beta, IL-6, IL-17A), evaluated the mRNA levels of Foxp3 and ROR-gammat, and serum immunoglobulin and complements.
BrdU-labeled cells rather than neurons, were mainly co-labeled with nestin and GFAP.
Ubc9 promotes the stability of Smad4 and the nuclear accumulation of Smad1 in osteoblast-like Saos-2 cells.
Hepatocytes express functional NOD1 and NOD2 receptors: a role for NOD1 in hepatocyte CC and CXC chemokine production.
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are expressed in several cell types of the mammary gland including stromal fibroblasts (e.g., MMP3, MMP2), epithelial cells (e.g., MMP7 or MMP9), adipocytes (e.g., MMP2) and lymphoid cells (e.g., MMP9) (Crawford et al. 1996; Lund et al. 1996; Wiseman et al. 2003).
ANGPTL2 was co-expressed in both, fibroblast-like and macrophage-like synoviocytes.
VEGFR2 was expressed by neurons, astrocytes and endothelial cells.
CDKN2/p16 inactivation and p16 immunohistochemistry in astrocytic gliomas.
Lysozyme, alpha 1-ACT, alpha 1-AT, transferrin, and albumin were never demonstrable in interdigitating reticulum cells, dendritic reticulum cells, or lymphoid cells.
CXCR5(lo)ICOS(lo) CD4(+) T cells secreted larger amounts of IL-21 and IL-10 than CXCR5(hi)ICOS(hi) GC-Tfh cells upon activation, and they induced proliferation and differentiation of na?ve B cells into Ig-producing cells more efficiently than GC-Tfh cells.
CS fibroblasts increased CCL2 expression and macrophage migration.
Those cells expressed the epithelial cell markers p63 and cytokeratin-14, and the ameloblast markers ameloblastin and enamelin, whereas they did not express the endodermal cell marker Gata6 or mesodermal cell marker brachyury.
At least two oocyte-derived growth factors, GDF9 and BMP15, are required for EGFR expression by cumulus cells.
Principally, SOCS1 and SOCS3 regulate T cells as well as antigen-presenting cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells.
GATA-1- colonies contained phenotypically normal macrophages, neutrophils and megakaryocytes, indicating that GATA-1 is not required for the in vitro differentiation of cells in these lineages.
In contrast, PRCR significantly reduced PPAR?, SOX-9 and RUNX2-positive cell numbers, and significantly reduced the numbers of TSC-derived adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteocytes.
The relative ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA expression levels in unloaded macrophages, as well as their protein levels in loaded macrophage foam cells, were similar in the two study groups.
