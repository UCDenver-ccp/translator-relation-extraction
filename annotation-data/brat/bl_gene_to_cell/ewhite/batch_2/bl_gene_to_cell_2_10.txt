Immunofluorescent triple staining of neurons (NeuN), astrocytes (GFAP), and microglia (IBA1) was performed 90 days after 2VO.
Unexpectedly, phospho-Smad2 and phospho-Smad3 were decreased in Smad7-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, whereas phospho-Smad1/5/8 was similarly expressed in wild-type and Smad7-deficient MEF cells.
Double immunofluorescence studies revealed colocalization with NeuN (mature neurons), beta III tubulin (immature neurons), GFAP (astrocytes), and CD68 (activated microglia).
While NTF3 knockdown resulted in decreased viability and differentiation of NT2D1 cells, and POU3F2 knockdown downregulated NTF3 expression, recombinant NTF3 significantly rescued viable neuronal cells from NTF3- or POU3F2-knockdown cell cultures.
Investigated subpopulations consisted of total lymphocyte count, CD4+, CD8+, T regulatory Foxp3+ (Tregs), Th17 lymphocytes and white blood cell (WBC) count.
This biologic selectivity suggests that granulocytes may respond differently to inflammatory mediators such as granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF).
A protocol is presented for cell culture of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) differentiated human monocyte-derived macrophages.
Double immunofluorescence analysis of AQP4 and S100 protein, a known marker for FS cells, marginal layer cells, and pituicytes, clearly revealed that FS cells and marginal layer cells in the adenohypophysis and the pituicytes in pars nervosa are positive for AQP4.
Haemonectin, a granulocytic-cell-binding protein, is related to the plasma glycoprotein fetuin.
Sorting for HER2(high)  and HER2(low)  cells revealed an upregulation of stem cell markers NANOG, OCT4 and SOX2 in the HER2(low)  cell fraction.
The presence or activity of vascular endothelial cells (CD34), macrophages (F4/80), osteoblasts (alkaline phosphatase [ALP]), and osteoclasts (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase [TRAP]) were evaluated using histochemical analyses.
Neural stem cells (NSCs), when stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), have the capacity to renew, expand, and produce precursors for neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes.
Angiopoietin 2 stimulates TIE2-expressing monocytes to suppress T cell activation and to promote regulatory T cell expansion.
Emergence of mouse erythrocyte receptor, CD21, CD23, and PCA-1 in hairy cells during deoxycorformycin therapy.
Selective enhancement of GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-8 production by monocytes and macrophages of asthmatic subjects.
In 13 noradrenergic LC neurons, GIRK1, GIRK2, GIRK3, and GIRK4 mRNAs existed in 12, 13, nine, and six neurons, respectively.
Indian HIV patients had fewer CD4+CCR5+ T cells and CCR5-expressing activated CD4+ T cells, but higher CXCR4-expressing activated CD4+ T cells compared with controls.
In cultured articular chondrocytes, IL-1 beta, IL-1 alpha, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage CSF cytokine genes were expressed only after induction by IL-1 beta.
In the present study, we show that megakaryocytes and platelets express connexin 37 (Cx37).
CD2+/CD14+ monocytes rapidly differentiate into CD83+ dendritic cells.
