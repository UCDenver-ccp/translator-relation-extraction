Several studies showed that AQP3 is essential for T cell function and macrophage migration and that AQP5 and AQP9 regulate neutrophil cell migration and impact sepsis survival.
M1 macrophages are typically derived from myeloid progenitors with murine macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF, also known as CSF-1), while M2 macrophages are thought to be derived from mature M1 macrophages by treatment with interleukin-4 (IL-4) or IL-13.
Malignant CD14+ monocytes and CD34+ haematopoietic progenitor cells were isolated from peripheral blood/bone marrow mononuclear cells.
CD19(+)IL-10(+) regulatory B cells affect survival of tongue squamous cell carcinoma patients and induce resting CD4(+) T cells to CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells.
Expression of SIGIRR protein, a negative regulator of TLR4, was higher in M1 macrophages than in monocytes.
The induced CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells were co-cultured with autologous CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells to estimate the suppressive ability of the induced CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells to CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells.
These cells are capable of differentiation into neuronal and glial cell phenotypes and the differentiated cells express the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and the neuronal marker microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2), respectively.
The majority of cells positive for CXCR3 coexpressed CD3, whereas Gr1-positive granulocytes were negative for CXCR3 expression.
RAC1 in keratinocytes regulates crosstalk to immune cells by Arp2/3-dependent control of STAT1.
Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin M similarly induce osteoclast formation in cocultures of osteoblastic cells and bone marrow cells.
NGF and BDNF) and their receptors, some pro-inflammatory cytokines (L-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma), microglia and astrocytes, and the cholinergic neuronal cells in the forebrain.
However, HIF-1? regulation in CD4(+) T cells (T cells) remains elusive.
Moreover, a significant induction in the expression of osteopontin, ALP, and Runx2 in osteoblasts, type I collagen in fibroblasts, and vinculin in endothelial cells could be observed in the irradiated cells.
Neonatal adipocytes and Schwann cells also expressed NGF mRNA and protein, while adult adipocytes and Schwann cells displayed only NGF-ir.
OX42-positive microglia/macrophages rarely contained activated caspase-3.
Hyperexpression of NOD2 in intestinal mast cells of Crohn's disease patients: preferential expression of inflammatory cell-recruiting molecules via NOD2 in mast cells.
The response of PYK2 to sperm-oocyte interaction appeared unrelated to gamete fusion since PYK2 was recruited to sperm - binding sites under conditions where sperm - oocyte fusion was prevented and since PYK2 suppression or ablation did not prevent sperm - oocyte fusion.
SHH and GLI2 localized to epithelial cells, whereas Patched-1, Smoothened, and GLI1 were observed mainly in fibroblasts and inflammatory cells.
monocytes into dendritic cells greatly diminished expression of DCIR4, while that into macrophages did not significantly affect DCIR4 expression.
ETs induced Fos protein expression in both granule cells and glia but not in Purkinje cells.
