These exosomes can be directly internalized into astrocytes and increase astrocyte miR-124a and GLT1 protein levels.
ATDC5 cells were induced to develop into hypertrophic chondrocytes via Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium.
Granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor reduces the affinity of SHP-2 for the ITIM of CLECSF6 in neutrophils: a new mechanism of action for SHP-2.
Three major cell types were identified on the basis of their morphological and immunocytochemical phenotype: neuronal-shaped cells expressing the neuronal markers neuron specific enolase, microtubule associated protein 2, neural cell adhesion molecule and beta-tubulin III; glial-like cells immunoreactive for glial fibrillary acidic protein and flattened cells immunolabelled with antibodies against beta-tubulin III and nestin, most likely neuronal precursors.
In contrast, for co-expressing lymphoid differentiation antigens, the proportion of CD34+CD38+ cells (38.34 +/- 6.09%) was relatively higher than that of CD34+CD10+ cells (11.52 +/- 1.24%) or CD34+CD2+ cells (9.84 +/- 2.30%).
Intraepithelial tumor infiltrating lymphocytes: CD8+, CD4+, FOXP3+, CD56+, tumor associated macrophages: CD68+, and GZB+ cells were calculated in 85 vulvar squamous cell carcinomas with previously defined p16Ink4a and high-risk HPV-status.
BrdU incorporation was noted in insulin-, glucagon-, and somatostatin-containing cells and also in non-endocrine cells.
Moreover, MSC-DCs can efficiently generate CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells from CD4+CD25-Foxp3-T cells.
We identified 73 different sperm proteins, including two less characterized human sperm proteins, Annexin A7 (ANXA7) and c14orf105.
Endothelin-1 is secreted abluminally by endothelial cells, and binds ETA and ETB2 receptors expressed on vascular smooth muscle cells, and ETB1 expressed on endothelial cells.
Stromelysin-3 mRNA and protein colocalized with endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages within the lesion.
Mast cells and T cells in Kimura's disease express increased levels of interleukin-4, interleukin-5, eotaxin and RANTES.
PTHrP (1-37) promptly enhanced MKP1 protein and gene expression and MKP1-dependent catalase activity in osteoblastic cells.
CD44(+)CD24? cells expressed stem cell markers and differentiated to CD44(+)CD24(+) cells by immunofluorescence assay and fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis.
In all the groups studied, monocytes were most numerous cells; large granular lymphocytes (phenotype: CD56++CD16-CD3), macrophages (CD68+) and immunonegative lymphocytes were observed in equal proportions; the least numerous populations were those of NK-cells (CD56+/-CD16+), plasmocytes and granulocytes.
Kindlin-3 is expressed in platelets, hematopoietic cells, and endothelial cells.
Negative regulation of platelet clearance and of the macrophage phagocytic response by the transmembrane glycoprotein SHPS-1.
Furthermore, ODN 2059 induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by B lymphocytes and IL-6 and IL-12 production by PBMC, monocytes, and macrophages.
Activation of thymocytes and T cells by interleukin-6.
In these conditions of PAR4 induction, ERK2 and p38 activation were involved in platelet spreading but not in platelet adhesion.
