CD14- dendritic cells share expression of class II MHC and costimulatory ligands with CD14+ monocyte progeny, but only the CD14- HLA-DR+ dendritic cells are highly stimulatory of resting unprimed T cells.
CXCL1 expression originated from neurons and endothelial cells while MIP-1? was expressed by neurons and microglia.
Interleukin 15 (IL-15) is a glycoprotein secreted primarily by macrophages and monocytes.
These results suggest that colon cancer cell-derived TNF-alpha stimulates TNF-alpha and CSF-1 production by macrophages, and that CSF-1, in turn, induces macrophage VEGF-A and MMP-2 in an autocrine manner.
PAF receptor (PAFR) may be expressed on cellular and nuclear membranes of various cell types, especially leukocytes, platelets, endothelial cells, neuronal cells and microglia.
APC, be they monocytes/macrophages, B cells or T cells.
PreHD monocytes released lower levels of IL-8, IL-10 and IL-13, with no reduction observed in HV monocytes.
Immunohistochemical staining for TNF-alpha and macrophages on adjacent sections confirms that the main part of TNF-alpha-positive cells are polymorphonuclear neutrophils and shows that most of the cells located just beneath the layer of TNF-alpha-positive neutrophils are macrophages with weak TNF-alpha immunoreactivity.
CD14? monocytes and a monocytic cell line, THP-1, were stimulated with NPCMD in vitro.
Induction of VEGF-C by IFN-? was detected also in other myeloid cells, such as blood-purified CD1c(+) DCs, CD14(+) monocytes and in monocyte-derived macrophages.
The marker for chondrocyte hypertrophy, collagen X was highly expressed in Sox9 transduced chondrocytes but lower in OSKM or Sox9+ OSKM cells (P < 0.05).
Furthermore, hemopexin did not affect actin organization in cells that do not express nephrin, specifically human glomerular endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and HEK293 cells.
CD34+ and CD34- OECs were negative for hematopoietic cell marker CD45 and expressed the endothelial cell surface markers CD31, CD146, CD105, and VEGFR-2.
Mast cells and CD68-positive macrophages, MMP-1, MMP-9 and CD34-positive blood vessels were seen in all cases.
Both isoforms caused pulmonary infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils, whereas mm IL-33 also caused pulmonary eosinophilia and goblet cell hyperplasia and increased expression of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17, MCP-1, and KC.
Immunolabeling for ADAM10 or ADAM17 in combination with markers for astro- and microglia revealed an increased labeling of ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the denervated outer molecular layer that was associated with reactive astrocytes but not with microglia.
Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) independently stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of macrophages from bone marrow progenitor cells.
ATF3, LISCH7), neuronal growth (e.g.
Importantly, CXCR4 mRNA was higher in stem cell-enriched CD44+/CD24- patient-derived breast cancer cells compared to non-enriched cells.
Overexpression of Cdk6 and Ccnd1 in chondrocytes inhibited chondrocyte maturation and caused p53-dependent apoptosis without enhancing proliferation.
