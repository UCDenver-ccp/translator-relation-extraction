C5a receptor (C5aR, CD88) is a receptor originally described on neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages but recently found on hepatocytes, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and tissue mast cells.
In vitro, MIP-3 alpha was increased in cultured keratinocytes treated with IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha and was present in immature and mature dendritic cells, THP-1 monocytic cells and activated T cells.
An another marker of human Th2 and Tc2 cells, CRTH2 molecules was also expressed on CCR4+ CD4+-T cells and CCR4+ CD8+-T cells.
Additionally, CD19-positive B-lymphocytes represent practically the only lymphocyte population capable of expressing CD35.
In vivo control of diabetogenic T-cells by regulatory CD4+CD25+ T-cells expressing Foxp3.
These findings indicate that TNF-alpha attenuated cell death of Prnp(-/-) neuronal cells by induction of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L),and that decreases in Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) played crucial roles in the apoptosis of Prnp(-/-) neuronal cells.
FEV, GATA2 and LMX1B in combination with ASCL1 and NGN2 directly and efficiently generated serotonergic neurons from human fibroblasts.
TLR2 mRNA expression by PBMCs and TLR2 protein expression by monocytes and granulocytes were significantly increased in the G+ bacteremia group.
To determine their ability to differentiate into osteoclasts, NCD14+ monocytes were further cultured with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) together with RANKL or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha).
CD34+ cell-derived hematopoietic precursors amplified with FLT3-ligand, thrombopoietin and stem cell factor became, after a 6-day induction with GM-CSF, IL-4 and TGF-beta1, HLA-DR+, CD1a+, CD83-, CD86-, CD80- cells.
The expression of MX1 in neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages is mediated by TLR4 but not TLR2.
No significant differences between groups were found in the levels of TNF?, IgG, IL-10, IL-8, leucocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, Th cells or B cells.
ACKR2 and ACKR3 mRNA and ACKR4 protein were mainly localized to luminal epithelial cells and weakly to glandular epithelial cells in the endometrium.
Insufficient apoptosis of fibroblast-like synoviocytes and inflammatory cells in RA could increase the expression of PDCD5 protein.
Compared with the non-CHB group, more CD68-positive macrophages, CD20-positive B cells, and CD15-positive neutrophils infiltrated the synovium in the CHB group (all p?<??0.05).
Since regulatory T cells (Treg cells) may express receptors for specific chemokines, we cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells with supernatants of HT29 cells previously treated with Bifidobacterium strains and analyzed FOXP3 and CD25 Treg markers and CCR6, CXCR3, CCR4, and CCR3 expression on CD4(+) lymphocytes.
Reflecting this background, FL cells are immunohistochemically positive for BCL2 as well as GC B cell markers CD10 and BCL6.
Functional analysis of ZFP36 proteins in keratinocytes.
Human CCR4+ CCR6+ Th17 cells suppress autologous CD8+ T cell responses.
The detection of a small number of CD1a+/CD68+/BG+ dendritic epidermal cells may identify these cells as a link between the CD1a+/CD68+/BG+ Langerhans cells and the CD1a-/CD68+/BG- cell population and suggests that these cells represent a transitional form of myelomonocytic cells during their phenotypic and morphologic transformation into resident epidermal Langerhans cells.
