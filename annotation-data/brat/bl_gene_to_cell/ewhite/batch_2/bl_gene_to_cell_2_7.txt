These were derived from monocytes cultured either with IL-4 and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (IL-4-Mo-DC) or with IL-4 and granulocyte-macrophage CSF plus TNF-alpha.
Furthermore, it is likely that ET-1 and TGF-beta were released by stretched cardiac fibroblasts and endothelial cells to induce TGF-beta1 mRNA expression in stationary cardiomyocytes.
Small neurons also displayed calbindin- and calretinin-immunoreactivity.
SIRT1 was detected in all leukocyte subsets including lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes.
As progenitors of neutrophils, Lin-c-kit?Sca-1- cells expressed FPR2.
The adipokine adiponectin is well known to affect the function of immune cells and upregulation of CCL2 by adiponectin in monocytes/macrophages has already been reported.
Megakaryocytes derived from CD34-positive cord blood cells produce interleukin-8.
In human monocytic cell line U937, GM-CSF increased MCP-1 expression in protein and mRNA levels.
Insulin signaling pathway protects neuronal cell lines by Sirt3 mediated IRS2 activation.
Human Th1 lymphocytes preferentially express CCR5 and CXCR3 while Th2 lymphocytes express CCR3, CCR4 and CCR8.
Ascl2 over-expression in Lovo and SW480 cells inhibited a goblet cell phenotype, as determined by reduced CDX2 and MUC2 expression.
Conditioned medium from Wnt5a-treated macrophages promoted macrophage chemotaxis mainly dependent on CCL2.
We found Akt hyperactive in fibroblasts and mammary epithelial cells lacking Prdx1.
Western blot was used to assess the protein levels of SIRT2, ?-SMA, collagen III, fibronectin, and MDM2 in tubular epithelial cells and fibroblasts.
And also both oligodendrocyte and astrocyte related proteins like O4 and GFAP were expressed by ELF-EMFs.
In Cx43 lacking astrocytes cocultured with neurons, the induction of Cx30 allows the restoration of dye coupling within islets of Cx30-positive astrocytes, indicating that intercellular channels formed by Cx30 are functional.
During the differentiation of THP-1 monocytic cells or primary human monocytes to macrophages, we observed that AICAR inhibited the expression of PPAR? target genes, such as fatty acid-binding protein 4 or CD36.
Loss of GPR56 protein was also evident in well-differentiated glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes and betaIII-tubulin-positive neurons.
From thymocyte cell suspensions depleted of CD2+, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD56+, and CD16+ cells, we further removed cells expressing HLA class I-specific inhibitory receptors including CD94/NKG2-A, p58.1, and p58.2 by immunomagnetic bead separation.
Both THP-1 monocytes and endothelial cells express SR-PSOX/CXCL16, and THP-1 monocytes express CXCR6, the specific receptor for SR-PSOX/CXCL16.
