Recombinant LIF and IL-6 skew monocyte differentiation into TAM-like cells by enabling monocytes to consume monocyte-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF).
Astrocyte conditioned medium increased ZO-1 protein content.
In addition, protein expression of TGF-beta1 and NT-3 receptors in microglia, GDNF receptors in astrocytes, and NT-3 receptors in neurons was increased by in vitro ischemia.
Analysis of leukocytes isolated from the spleen of challenged NSG-UC mice corroborated CD64, CD163 and CD1a expressing CD14+ monocytes, CD1a expressing CD11b+ macrophages and HGF, TARC, IFN? and TGF?1 mRNA as inflammatory markers.
Immunohistochemical studies revealed that AQP1 was localized in fibroblasts (especially in the subepithelial area) and endothelial cells of blood vessels, AQP2 was localized in the cytoplasm of epithelial  cells and acinar cells, AQP3 was localized in the basolateral sites of epithelial cells and acinar cells, AQP4 was localized in the basolateral sites of acinar cells, and AQP5 was localized in the apical sites of epithelial cells and acinar cells.
T-cell activation was measured by proportions of T-cells expressing surface marker CD38 and HLADR (CD4+CD38+HLA-DR+ and CD8+CD38+HLA-DR+ cells).
It acts in concert with platelet P-selectin and PSGL-1 in monocyte stimulation.
The effects of Rac1 and Cdc42 in promoting chondrocyte hypertrophy and of Rac1, Rac2 and Cdc42 in osteoclast are discussed.
These cells, which in appearance resemble fibroblasts, expand in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor and display monocytic and hematopoietic stem cell markers including CD14, CD34, and CD45.
ANGPTL4 protein was observed by immunofluorescence in osteoclasts and osteoblasts in vivo.
Similar to the bullwhip cells, the conventional glucagon-expressing amacrine cells were immunoreactive for calretinin, HuD, Pax6, and AP2alpha.
One leukocyte mucin, PSGL-1, tethers flowing leukocytes to P-selectin on activated platelets or endothelial cells, and also helps tether leukocytes to L-selectin on other leukocytes.
PCDH1 mRNA and protein were expressed in airway epithelial cells and in macrophages.
Phenotypic analysis indicated that phagocytes were typically CD14(+)CD16(-) macrophages, with occasional CD14(+)CD16(+) macrophages.
Cultured keratinocytes expressed neurotrophin-4, whereas dermal fibroblasts expressed neurotrophin-3.
In numerous cells types, such as mesangial cells or myoblasts, endoglin regulates negatively TGF-?-induced ECM protein expression.
Differentiation of drNPCs generated large numbers of ?III-tubulin and MAP2 positive neurons as well as some GFAP-positive astrocytes, which likely had a neuronal supporting function.
IL-4 was mostly found in lymphocytes and plasma cells in nasal polyps and IL-5 in eosinophils and lymphocytes.
Depending on NOD1/NOD2 ratio in specific cell types, meso-DAP-containing muropeptides can be recognized either primarily via NOD2 (in monocytes) or via NOD1 (in monocyte-derived macrophages and HEK293T-derived cells).
In vitro, visfatin/Nampt significantly induced the expression of interleukin 6, keratinocyte chemoattractant and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 in chondrocytes and osteoblasts.
