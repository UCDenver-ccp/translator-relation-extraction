GAS6 inhibits granulocyte adhesion to endothelial cells.
expression through SMAD2/SMAD3, thus affecting the H3K27me3 marker on adipocyte-specific genes and the trans-differentiation from myocytes to adipocytes.
Insulin stimulates gene expression of ferritin light chain in osteoblast cells.
ABCA1 expression, but not ABCG1 expression, increased in the macrophage foam cells treated with BRL37344-treated HepG2 cell supernatants.
Brain injury was assessed by immunohistology for myelin basic protein (MBP), IBA1 (microglial marker), GFAP (astrocyte marker), OLIG2 (oligodendrocyte marker), NeuN (neuronal marker), CD3 (T cells), and CD14 (monocytes).
Moreover, in CD45-null mice, the maturation of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes into CD4+CD8- or CD4-CD8+ thymocytes is severely impaired.
Furthermore, CD4+Nrp1(high) T cells express high levels of Foxp3 and suppress CD4+CD25- T cells.
In contrast to NWT cells, which consisted of CD4+, CD8+ and CD56+ (NK) cells, purified CD4+ T cells were less responsive to immunomodulation by CTLA4-Ig and IL-10.
HLA-DR antigen expression in epithelial cells, B-cells, suppressor and helper lymphocytes, Langerhans' cells, and monocytes/macrophages were studied immunohistochemically in frozen sections using anti-human HLA-DR, anti-CD22, anti-CD8, anti-CD4, anti-CD1a, and anti-LeuM5 monoclonal antibodies.
c-Kit and stem cell factor regulate PANC-1 cell differentiation into insulin- and glucagon-producing cells.
beta-Amyloid1-40 increases expression of beta-amyloid precursor protein in neuronal hybrid cells.
Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a potent chemoattractant for monocytes, T-cells, and natural killer cells.
Dermal fibroblasts from seven healthy donors and cells from seven patients with MYH11 or ACTA2 variants were transdifferentiated into SMC-like cells within a 2-week duration using 5 ng/ml TGF?1 on a scaffold containing collagen and elastin.
These particles express CD15 and bind P-selectin exposed on either activated platelets or platelet-derived microparticles.
Changes in CD4(+) T-cell subsets revealed an initial increase in CD4(+) CD45RO T cells followed by a sustained increase in CD4(+) CD45RA T cells.
Three monocyte subsets exist, CD14(++)CD16(-), CD14(++)CD16(+) and CD14(+)CD16(++) monocytes; cell counts of CD14(++)CD16(+) and CD14(+)CD16(++) monocytes are increased in pre-transplant chronic kidney disease.
Expression of p57-Kip2 in monocytes and macrophages.
Eccentric exercise had no effect on the concentrations of neutrophils, lymphocytes, CD16+/CD56+, CD4+, CD8+, CD14+/CD38+, lymphocyte proliferative response, or cytotoxic activities.
Later, these Sox1(-)  cells clearly segregate from cells that originated from Sox1(+)  dorsal neuroepithelial cell-derived NCCs.
A population of nestin-positive cells was also positive for vimentin, an intermediate filament protein expressed by mesenchymal cells.
