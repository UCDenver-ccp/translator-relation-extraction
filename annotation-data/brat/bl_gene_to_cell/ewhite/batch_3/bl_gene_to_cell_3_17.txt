Furthermore, BMP upregulates hepatocyte hepcidin expression, a process enhanced by hemojuvelin and blunted in Hfe2-/- hepatocytes.
Reconstituted experiments created by adding microglia from MAC1(-/-) or MAC1(+/+) mice back to MAC1(+/+) neuron-enriched cultures showed that microglia with functional MAC1 expression was mandatory for microglia-enhanced neurotoxicity.
Further-more, GLP-1 upregulates expression of b-cell genes (GLUT2, glucokinase, insulin, and PDX-1) and promotes b-cell neogenesis and differentiation of ductal cells into insulin secreting cells.
Fibrosis of the mesothelial cells was induced by TGF-?1, which upregulates the CXCL12-CXCR4 and CXCL16-CXCR6 axes of mesothelial cells.
Throughout the brainstem, neurons immunoreactive for GluR2/3 and NMDAR1 were most numerous, whereas neurons labeled for GluR1, GluR4, and GluR5/6/7 were less common.
To address the question to which extent primary human B and T lymphocytes express CD21 mRNA and membrane-bound CD21 glycoprotein, we separated B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors.
Neuronal pentraxins comprise three neuronal proteins, neuronal pentraxin receptor (NPR) which is a type-II transmembrane protein on the neuronal surface, and secreted neuronal pentraxin-1 and NARP.
Tryptase may activate PAR-2 on keratinocytes and endothelial cells during inflammation.
IL-1beta and IL-6 were found in astrocytes, macrophages, microglia, and endothelial cells.
The knockdown of p0071 in Fmr1- fibroblasts restored stress fibers and an elongated cell shape, thus rescuing the Fmr1- phenotype, whereas overexpression of p0071 in Fmr1+ cells mimicked the Fmr1- phenotype.
Somatostatin and Somatostatin-Containing Neurons in Shaping Neuronal Activity and Plasticity.
PECAM, NG2, ?SMA, and LYVE-1 labeling identified endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and lymphatic endothelial cells, respectively.
SoxD proteins enhance transactivation by Sox9 in chondrocytes, but antagonize Sox9 and other SoxE proteins in oligodendrocytes and melanocytes, and also repress transcription through various mechanisms in several other lineages.
GM-CSF was assayed by ELISA in supernatants from cultured RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes stimulated with various cytokines (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, macrophage-CSF, IFN-gamma, IL-6, and TGF-beta).
Transitional B cells commit to marginal zone B cell fate by Taok3-mediated surface expression of ADAM10.
Silencing of CTCF in BCL6-expressing cells reduced BCL6 mRNA and protein expression, which is sufficient to induce B-cell terminal differentiation toward plasma cells.
Furthermore, TSLP stimulates FoxP3 expression in purified (CD4+)CD8- thymocytes, but not in (CD4+)CD8+, (CD4-)CD8+ and (CD4-)CD8- thymocytes.
Caspase-2 is not required for thymocyte or neuronal apoptosis even though cleavage of caspase-2 is dependent on both Apaf-1 and caspase-9.
Ethanol directly induced HMGB1 release through NOX2/NLRP1 inflammasome in neuronal cells.
MCP-1 mRNA was concentrated in a population of neurons, while MCP-1 protein was localized to endothelial cells.
