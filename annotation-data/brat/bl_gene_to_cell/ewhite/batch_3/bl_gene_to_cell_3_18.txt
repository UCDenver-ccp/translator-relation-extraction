In addition, GM-CSF induced Jak2, STAT5A, and STAT5B in BV-2 cells, as it does in monocytes and macrophages.
Transferrin induces maturation of neutrophil granulocyte precursors in vitro.
Caspase-8 was expressed richly in GFAP-positive astrocytes and Iba-1-positive microglia, but was not detected in Neun-positive neurons.
Meanwhile, LEN activated NK cells and increased CD16 expression on CD56(low)CD16(+) NK cells.
Coculture with CD4+ T cells induced optimal gamma delta T cell expansion, although IL-2 alone could provide this helper function in the absence of CD4+ T cells.
Among neural cells examined, leptomeningeal cells expressed the highest lyso-PLD activity and autotaxin protein.
Intercellular chatter: osteoblasts, osteoclasts and interleukin 6.
When S1P release from osteoblastic cells is decreased (inhibition of SphK1, knock-down of SphK1 or the S1P transporter, Spns2 by siRNA) or secreted S1P neutralized with anti-S1P antibody, the proliferative and survival effects of osteoblasts on CaP cells are abolished.
RNA analysis showed that stromal cells transcribed, in addition to SCF, messages for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-monocyte CSF (GM-CSF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta).
Following pulpal inflammation, the proportion of VGLUT2+ and of VGLUT2+/TRPM8+ neurons increased significantly, whereas that of TRPM8+ neurons remained unchanged.
Neuron and microglia/macrophage-derived FGF10 activate neuronal FGFR2/PI3K/Akt signaling and inhibit microglia/macrophages TLR4/NF-?B-dependent neuroinflammation to improve functional recovery after spinal cord injury.
Microinjection of antibodies against Nir2 into neuronal cells markedly attenuates neurite extension, whereas overexpression of Nir2 in these cells attenuates Rho-mediated neurite retraction.
Few other PDEs such as PDE7B, PDE10A, and PDE11A are either detected in granulosa cells or oocytes.
As compared with osteoarthritic chondrocytes, normal chondrocytes showed stronger immunoreactivity for AdipoR1, AdipoR2, and T-cadherin.
Cultured astrocytes constitutively expressed MMP2, MT1-MMP, TIMP1, and TIMP2, whereas MMP3, MMP7, MMP9, and MMP12 were not detectable in tissues or in cultured astrocytes.
Inflammatory cells were largely CD68-positive microglia with a few CD15-positive neutrophils in the areas of neuronal necrosis.
CD34+ cell numbers significantly correlated with those of leucocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes, as well as levels of MCP-1, and the CD34+ cells exhibited changes similar to platelet-derived microparticles.
FOXP1-, FOXP2-, and CUTL1-positive cells also expressed the immature neuron marker, Nestin/PROX1, whereas TBR1-, CTIP2-, and SATB2-positive cells only expressed MAP2/2B.
GLUT1 and GLUT3 are expressed in the nervous system, GLUT1 in endothelial cells and astrocytes, and GLUT3 in neurons.
RANKL protein was associated with CD3 antigen-positive lymphocytes and some macrophages.
