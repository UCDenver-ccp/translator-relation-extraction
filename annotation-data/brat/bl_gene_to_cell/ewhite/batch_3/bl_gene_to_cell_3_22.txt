However, CatSper1 null sperm lack CatSper2 protein and CatSper2 null sperm lack CatSper1 protein.
Notably, TSPO colocalization with the astrocyte marker GFAP was greater than with the microglia marker, Mac-1.
IL-1 beta and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) were not detected in any culture.
Monocyte-macrophages bearing CD68 were also detected.
Synergy between adiponectin and interleukin-1? on the expression of interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and cyclooxygenase-2 in fibroblast-like synoviocytes.
Next, an increased expression of HSP27 was detected in epithelial cells, whereas SERPINB1 expression was noted in neutrophils and epithelial cells.
NLGN3 is cleaved from both neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells via the ADAM10 sheddase.
Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1) is expressed by spontaneously outgrown EBV-B cell lines and activated normal B lymphocytes.
Emp, erythroblast-macrophage protein was initially identified as a mediator of erythroblast-macrophage interactions during erythroid differentiation.
In addition, CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells suppressed the proliferation of CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells.
While NR1NR2B receptors are predominantly expressed in immature neurons and promote plasticity, NR1NR2A receptors are mainly expressed in mature neurons and induce circuit stability.
Gastric biopsy samples from 27 patients with SSc and 15 healthy control subjects were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for CD45/leukocyte common antigen, CD3/T cells, CD4/T helper cells, CD8/cytotoxic T cells, CD20/B cells, CD14/monocytes, CD68/macrophages, cell adhesion molecules CD11a/lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), CD49d/very late activation antigen 4 (VLA-4), CD54/intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), CD106/vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), CD31/platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
Three monocyte subsets ("classical" CD14++?CD16-, "intermediate" CD14++? CD16+, "nonclassical" CD14+CD16++? monocytes), and surface markers (CD36 and CD9) were determined.
Adipocytes exhibited strong immunoreactivity for vimentin and were negative for pancytokeratin (AE1/AE3), glial fibrillary acidic protein, neuron-specific enolase, and synaptophysin.
Lactoferrin effects of phagocytic cell function.
In both culture paradigms, KS-IR was increased significantly by macrophage- (M-CSF) and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factors (GM-CSF), as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).
CD4(+) T cells, but not CD8(+) T cells or gammadelta T cells, were the cell population responsible for the induction of HSP65 expression in macrophages.
These oligodendrocyte/astrocyte (A/O) gap junctions contain multiple connexins (Cx), including Cx26, Cx30, and Cx43 on the astrocyte side, and Cx32, Cx29, and Cx47 on the oligodendrocyte side.
In this macrophage-dependent invasion, tumor cells secrete CSF-1 and sense EGF, whereas the macrophages secrete EGF and sense CSF-1.
We found that natural gp120 could stimulate monocytes to release TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, and this effect could be blocked with soluble CD4.
