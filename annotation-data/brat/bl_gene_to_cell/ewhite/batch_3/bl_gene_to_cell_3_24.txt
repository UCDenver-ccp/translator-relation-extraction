CARMA1 is a lymphocyte-specific scaffold protein necessary for T cell activation.
The majority of these cells co-expressed GFAP, but not established stem cell markers such as Nestin, OLIG2 or SOX2.
In addition, COX-2 protein expression seen in MT-III-stimulated WT macrophages was abolished in both TLR2-/- and MyD88-/- cells, while perilipin 2 expression was abolished only in MyD88-/- cells.
Lactate is transported from Sertoli cells to germ cells via MCT1 and MCT2.
Induction of stem cell-derived microglia, activated microglia in brain slice cultures and THP-1 macrophages by LPS, but not interleukin-4, causes polySia depletion and, as shown for stem cell-derived microglia, a metalloproteinase-dependent release of polySia-ESL-1 and polySia-NRP2.
TLR7 responses in dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells are all inhibited by the anti-TLR7 antibody.
In culture cells, the p21WAF1/CIP1 protein was expressed in normal ovarian epithelial cells and at a high level in the adenocarcinoma 2008 and IGROV-1 cell lines.
Immune cells express a wide variety of serine proteases such as granzymes in cytotoxic lymphocytes, neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G and proteinase 3 in neutrophils and chymase and tryptase in mast cells.
Small hepatocytes were further coaxed to differentiate into mature hepatocyte-like cells, as identified by their morphological traits and strong expression of Ck8, Ck18, Cyp7a1, Hnf3b, Alb, Tat, Ttr, albumin, and CYP1A2 but not Ck7 or CK19.
Light basal cells expressed androgen receptors and dark cells estrogen receptors.
P-selectin mediates rolling of platelets and leukocytes on activated endothelial cells.
Monocytes can be differentiated by the presence of CD14 and CD16 (CD14++CD16-, classical; CD14++CD16+, intermediate and CD14?+?CD16++, non-classical monocytes).
IL-6 protein was localized to CD11b-positive microglia and macrophage-like cells.
The percentages of peripheral blood CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ Tregs and CD4+ T cells and the ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells in epileptic children were (2.4?0.5)%,
CCL2 is a CCR2 receptor chemokine that is a chemoattractant protein for monocytes/macrophages, T cells, and natural killer cells.
Combination of Runx2 and BMP2 increases conversion of human ligamentum flavum cells into osteoblastic cells.
SF CD4+FOXP3+ T cells were characterized by higher amounts of FOXP3 protein per cell when compared with peripheral CD4+FOXP3+ T cells, as revealed by the difference in FOXP3 median fluorescence intensity (median +/- SD, arbitrary units, 54 +/- 22.6 vs 19.5 +/- 4.2; p < 0.001).
RT-PCR showed that embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs) not only expresses the protein Sox2, Nestin but also Pax6, Musashi proteins and were differentiated into the three classical neuronal phenotypes (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes).
Both dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells pulsed with CBirTox selectively induced functional CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs in vitro, and CBirTox augmented CD4+Foxp3+ cell numbers in vivo.
Drosophila JAB1/CSN5 acts in photoreceptor cells to induce glial cells.
