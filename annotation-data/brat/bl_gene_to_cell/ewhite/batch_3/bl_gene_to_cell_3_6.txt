Cell adhesion molecule CEACAM1 associates with paxillin in granulocytes and epithelial and endothelial cells.
Gastrin induces the interaction between human mononuclear leukocytes and endothelial cells through the endothelial expression of P-selectin and VCAM-1.
BMP6 induction of hepcidin expression was reduced in Hfe KO hepatocytes compared with WT hepatocytes.
Here we show that cell-cell interaction between primary murine astrocytes and myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic Th1 and Th2 cells significantly increased production of NGF.
The neurons were stained with toluidine blue and NeuN, the astrocytes and microglia were stained with GFAP and Iba-1, respectively.
Cromolyn prevented a decreased expression of PECAM-1 on circulatory neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages and against an increased expression of ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 on pulmonary neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages 6 hours after AP induction (about 40% vs. 10%, p < 0.01).
Central to this process is the coordinated T lymphocyte production of three of these proteins, granulocyte macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF), IL-3, and IL-5.
The monocytic/macrophage marker, CD68, and the dendritic cell marker, CD21, were negative.
Additional antibodies used to characterize the rNSCs were markers for stem cells (nestin), immature neurons (betaIII-tubulin), astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), and oligodendrocytes (Rip).
Accordingly, UV exposure results in increased production of IL 1, IL 3, IL 6, tumour necrosis factor and granulocyte/macrophage-CSF by epidermal cells.
We found that murine GL261 glioma cells overexpress GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor encoded by the CSF2 gene) but not M-CSF when compared to normal astrocytes.
lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, CD4+, CD4+CD45RA+, CD4+CD45RO+, CD8+, CD8+CD57+, CD8+CD57-, HLA-DR+, CD25+ T cells, HLA-DR+, CD19+, CD20+, and CD21+ B cells) both pre- and post-DST.
CXCL12 and CXCR4 mRNA and protein were present in oocytes and granulosa cells.
GPC3-targeted CAR T cells could efficiently kill GPC3-positive HCC cells but not GPC3-negative cells in vitro.
Intraepithelial lymphocytes, CD4(+) T cells and also neutrophils secreted IL-21.
ICOS(+)CD4(+)FoxP3(+) T regulatory cells and CD11b(+)CD14(-)CD15(+) myeloid suppressor cells increased.
By using immunomagnetic-negative selection and cell sorting, five cell populations were obtained: unseparated mononuclear cells (MNCs; I); two lineage-negative cell populations, one enriched for CD34+ CD38+ cells (II) and the other enriched for CD34+ CD38- cells (III); and two CD34+ cell fractions purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, one containing CD34+ CD38+ cells (IV) and the other containing CD34+ CD38- cells (V).
CAM-DR is exerted via not only direct adhesion to stromal cells, fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, or macrophages but also indirect effects of IL-6, IGF-1, and SDF-1 in myeloma cells.
We also quantified protein levels of the neuronal (GLUT3) and astrocytic (GLUT1) glucose transporters.
The most significant correlation was recognized for CD34+/CD61+ megakaryocytic cell number and platelet engraftment.
