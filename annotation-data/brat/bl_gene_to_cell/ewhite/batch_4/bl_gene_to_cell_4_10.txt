Numerous cleaved casp3-positive cells were colocalized with the astrocytic marker GFAP, whereas cleavage of neuronal casp3 was observed rarely.
Thus, TNF-alpha, produced from monocytic cells due to inflammatory diseases, may have an additive influence on insulin sensitivity to adipocyte-derived TNF-alpha.
Significant changes of circulating leukocytes included transiently increased neutrophils and monocytes with parallel increases of CD33+ and CD14+ cells.
Aside from epithelial cells, the principal source of immunoreactivity for all three alarmins, TSLP, and IL-33 immunoreactivity colocalized principally with endothelial cells and mast cells, neutrophils, and fibroblasts, whereas IL-25 immunoreactivity colocalized principally with eosinophils as well as endothelial cells, mast cells, and fibroblasts.
Disturbed flow in vitro increased TLR4 expression and activation in human endothelial cells and promoted monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion, which were inhibited in TLR4-knockdown endothelial cells.
RA-treated CD133+ cells expressed mRNA transcripts for neuron-specific markers neurofilament proteins (NF-L, -M, -H) and synaptophysin as determined by RT-PCR, structural proteins characteristic of neurons including tubulin beta III and neuron specific enolase (NSE) by Western blot, and neuron-specific markers NeuN and microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) by immunocytochemistry.
Using fibroblast-like synoviocytes, we found that protein I/II also exerts an immunomodulatory effect (IL-6 and IL-8 release) on these cells.
Stem cell marker neuroepithelial stem cell protein (nestin), enteric neuronal marker protein gene production 9.5 (PGP9.5)
They also form platelet- monocytes aggregates causing endothelial cell P-selectin expression.
ICAM-1 has been shown to mediate, in part, the in vitro adhesion of lymphocytes and neutrophils to endothelial cells expressing ICAM-1.
Spleen-derived macrophages, dendritic cells (DC), and B cells constitutively express ART2.1 as their predominant ART while spleen T cells express both ART2.1 and the thiol-independent ART2.2 isoform.
Nascent astrocytes derived from EGF-generated progenitor cells showed a similar pattern of GFAP and nestin immunoreactivity.
CCL2/MCP-1 represents a link between the activation of monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils, mast cells, and eosinophils in inflammatory disorders, such as the late-phase allergic reaction.
p53 and thymic 'death by neglect': thymic epithelial cell-induced apoptosis of CD4+8+ thymocytes is p53-independent.
In addition, these neuronal cell types do not synthesize two glial proteins, S100 protein (S100P) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).
Differentiation of B cells into plasma cells requires X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1).
Cultured stromal cells and macrophages produced tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6.
In conclusion, microgravity interplays with BMP4/Notch1 signaling in stem cells thus inducing differentiation of stem cells to hepatocytes.
Additional proteins that may have nonessential yet still facilitating roles in sperm-oolemma adhesion and fusion include oolemma-anchored integrins and oocyte-expressed retroviral envelope proteins, sperm disintegrins, and sperm-borne proteins of epididymal origin such as CRISP1 and CRISP2.
VEGF protein was localized in both vascular endothelial cells and synovial lining cells.
