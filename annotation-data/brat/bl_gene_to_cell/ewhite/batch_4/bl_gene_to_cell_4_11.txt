Cells are tested for safety (sterility, endotoxin), identity/potency (cell count, CD45/CD34/CD133, viability) and purity (contaminant granulocytes and platelets).
The aim of this study was to investigate sulfonylurea 1/transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (SUR1-TRPM4) ion channel SUR1 expression in various cell types (neurons, astrocytes, endothelial cells, microglia, macrophages, and neutrophils) of human brain contusions and whether SUR1 up-regulation was related to time postinjury.
The 16 kDa V-ATPase antisense RNA abolished the stimulatory effect of GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-6 on TRAP-positive osteoclast formation, but did not affect the formation of monocytes and macrophages after IL-3 treatment, or the formation of granulocytes after IL-6 treatment.
Dual knockdown of Irs1 and Irs2 but not Insr in preadipocytes impaired differentiation to adipocytes.
Unlike GFAP, however, synemin is not expressed in mature astrocytes and, unlike vimentin and nestin, synemin is not present in astrocytic precursors before GFAP expression.
CD68/ and PGP 9.5/PACAP38 double labelling showed that PACAP was not expressed either in macrophages or in epithelial cells, suggesting that the PACAP-positive cells observed were lymphoid cells.
CD68 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 were expressed in coexisting histiocytes and osteoclasts.
We found markedly deficient levels of P-selectin protein limited to megakaryocytes and platelets.
Circulating activated platelets were enriched with MRP-14 protein, which augmented the expression of the adhesion mediator, P-selectin, thereby promoting monocyte-platelet aggregates.
VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 are expressed by Langerhans cells, macrophages and endothelial cells in oral lichen planus.
Thrombospondin-1 differentially regulates release of IL-6 and IL-10 by human monocytic cell line U937.
In contrast, TGF-beta1 significantly decreased expression of PAR-2 in OA chondrocytes but increased PAR-2 in normal chondrocytes.
The histiocyte cells were positive for CD68.
Further, Nod1 stimulation induced an immunological response in tumor cells that differed from the response in normal epithelial cells, especially regarding the expression of ?-defensin 2, granulocyte monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and cell survival.
CD14+,CD16+ monocytes expressed higher levels of CCR1, CCR5, and ICAM-1 than did regular CD14++,CD16- monocytes, particularly in active RA.
Our targeting strategy is the use of CD11b(+)/Gr1(+) monocytes as the cell vehicle and a macrophage-specific promoter (Mac1) to control CYP27B1 expression.
BIGH3 protein and macrophages in retinal endothelial cell apoptosis.
Deletion of the gene for the osteoblast-derived protein, osteocalcin, leads to insulin resistance in mice, while the addition of osteocalcin increases insulin secretion from ?-cells and adiponectin expression in adipocytes.
Hence, BDNF produced by basal cells may be acting locally on neurons expressing TrkB.
Cells from each organ had negligible expression of RNAs coding for granulocyte (G), macrophage (M), and granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony stimulating factor (CSF), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), and IL-6.
