CD14-derived osteoclasts were shown to express CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 each at the similar level to that shown with macrophages.
We examined the role of HO-1 in regulating monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), two molecules involved in monocyte-macrophage cell trafficking after infection.
Here, we report that Bmi1 leads to the transdifferentiation of mouse fibroblasts into NSC-like cells, and, in combination with Oct4, can replace Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc during the reprogramming of fibroblasts into iPS cells.
T cells to recognize infected macrophages and clear Mtb.
All IgE+ cells were HLA-DR+ dendritic cells identified as either macrophages (CD68+, CD14+) or Langerhans cells (CD1+).
In contrast, the percentages of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, CD4+CD8- splenocytes, CD4+CD8- liver nonparenchymal cells, CD3+ splenocytes, and CD3+ bone marrow cells were increased.
ADORA2B protein expression was most obvious in vascular endothelial cells whereas ADORA3 protein was more abundant and expressed by synovial fibroblasts.
CD19(+) B cell numbers overturned to CD4(+) helper T cells.
Circulating monocytes can be divided into three distinct subtypes, namely in classical monocytes (CM; CD14++CD16-), intermediate monocytes (IM; CD14++CD16+) and non-classical monocytes (NCM; CD14+CD16++).
Inhibitors of DNA binding proteins restrict T cell potential by repressing Notch1 expression in Flt3-negative common lymphoid progenitors.
Compared to all other blood cell populations platelets showed the highest concentration of Dkk3 protein (150 ? 19 ng/mg total protein).
Many of the ficolin-1 dots were also positive for CD68, suggesting that the ficolin-1-positive cells were monocytes, such as macrophages or dendritic cells.
Weak colony growth was observed after exposure of GF-D8 cells to stem cell factor (SCF) but not after exposure to granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF), macrophage-CSF (M-CSF), IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-5, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).
SPTBN1 and ?-synuclein proteins colocalized in N2a neuronal cells.
Insulin and IGF-1 inhibited insulin release from INS-1 cells, an insulin secreting cell line.
We counted the number of CD4(+)FOXP3(+) T cells, CD4(+)CD25(+)CTLA-4(+) T cells, CD4(+) T cells that predominantly produce IL-10 (Tr1 cells) and IL-17 (Th17 cells) and monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mDCs) expressing Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and TLR4 in the peripheral blood of 47 EGPA patients and 40 bronchial asthma patients (who did not have EGPA) and calculated the percentages of monocytes and mDCs that produced IL-23p19 and IL-27 in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation.
Macrophages, lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear neutrophils and eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were analysed morphologically, and the subsets of T-lymphocytes (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+), HLA-DR+, B-lymphocytes (CD19+) and CD16+/CD56+ cells (natural killer, NK cells) were analysed by flow cytometry.
Efficient dendritic cell priming of T lymphocytes depends on the extracellular matrix protein mindin.
Peripheral blood was analyzed for monocytes, granulocytes and lymphocytes expressing the TLR2+, TLR4+, TLR6+, CD11b+, CD14+, CD16+, CD18+, CD24+, CD36+, CD54+, CD56+ and CD206+ receptors.
Also tested were the tumour protein p53-null promyelocytic HL-60 cells.
