The cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is produced by a variety of cells, including macrophages, T-cells, and B-cells.
Furthermore, IRF-1(-/-) CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells showed extremely high bent to differentiate into CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells, whereas restoring IRF-1 expression in IRF-1(-/-) CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells impaired their differentiation into CD25(+)Foxp3(+) cells.
Addition of interferon-gamma or granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor to the T cell/monocyte cultures enhanced T cell induction of monocyte TNF-alpha by threefold and ninefold, respectively.
Lamina cribrosa cells and ONH astrocytes also expressed protein for GDNF, Ret, and GFRalpha-1.
CCL3- and CCR5-deficient mice exhibited a reduction in intratumoral accumulation of macrophages, granulocytes, and fibroblasts.
Endothelial cells and macrophage-like cells expressed MCP-1 protein in the ischemic brain.
Efficient transformation of small hepatocytes into insulin-expressing cells by forced expression of Pdx1.
RANKL was specifically deleted in T cells (Tnfsf11(flox/?) Lck-Cre), in collagen VI expressing cells including synovial fibroblasts (Tnfsf11(flox/?) Col6a1-Cre) and in collagen II expressing cells including articular chondrocytes (Tnfsf11(flox/?) Col2a1-Cre).
Among microglia-derived substances, tumor necrosis factor alpha and plasminogen, which are heat-labile proteins, inhibited neuronal apoptosis.
Overexpression of CRABP II in TIS7+/+ neurones strongly increased the number of branch points, making them morphologically similar to TIS7-/- neurones.
Counting of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes revealed that astrocytic hypertrophy, but not proliferation, contributes to increased GFAP immunoreactivity.
Although both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells increased, CD8+ T cells increased more than CD4+ T cells, leading to a lower CD4+/CD8+ ratio compared to the control group.
Mammalian male and female germ cells express a germ cell-specific Y-Box protein, MSY2.
The neurotransmitter noradrenaline drives noggin-expressing ectoderm cells to activate N-tubulin and become neurons.
TH?gene overexpression in the lymphocytes reduced the percentage of interferon-??(IFN-?)-producing CD4+?cells and the ratio of CD4+IFN-?+/CD4+IL-4+?cells, as well as the percentages of CD4+CD26+ and CD4+CD30+?cells and the ratio of CD4+CD26+/CD4+CD30+?cells.
The T helper type 2 (Th2) cell product interleukin 10 (IL-10) inhibits the proliferation and function of Th1 lymphocytes and macrophages (M phi).
IL-15 induced effector ?? T cells displayed increased levels of the cytotoxic lymphocyte-associated proteins CD56, CD96, CD161 and perforin.
Soluble factors, including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), leptin, and TGF-beta, can modulate differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts or to other cell types such as chondrocytes or adipocytes.
SAMHD1 levels were also increased in CD4+?T cells compared to those in CD14+?monocytes and in PBMC compared to those of GALT.
Fourteen potential TLR8 modulators were experimentally validated in HEK293T cells stably overexpressing human TLR8 and THP-1 macrophages.
