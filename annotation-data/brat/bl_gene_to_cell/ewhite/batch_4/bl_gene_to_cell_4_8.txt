ICAM-1 is essential for lymphocyte-endothelial cell interactions.
Transgene induction led to blood-brain barrier leakage, induction of MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) (CCL2), ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1), and dramatic infiltration of CD45-positive leukocytes comprised of neutrophils, T-cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells.
Quantitative immunohistochemistry was used to assess mast cells, T cells, macrophages, nerve fibers, and neuronal outgrowth (growth-associated protein 43, GAP43+fibers).
GFP positive cells were also positive to CD31, CD68 and Runx2 suggesting that fibroblasts differentiated into osteoclasts and tissue macrophages.
Importantly, collagen fragments failed to inhibit osteoclast formation from LAIR-1 deficient murine osteoclast precursors.
T cells showed that STAT1 in CD4(+) T cells was not required for Th1 differentiation during L. major infection.
Cx37 is found in endothelial cells, monocytes/macrophages and platelets, Cx40 is predominantly an endothelial connexin, and Cx43 is found in a large variety of cells such as smooth muscle cells, resident and circulating leukocytes (neutrophils, dendritic cells, lymphocytes, activated macrophages, mast cells) and some endothelial cells.
VILIP-1 and VILIP-3 are expressed in different populations of neuronal cells.
Flow cytometry was used to determine leukocytes, CD34/CD45+ cells, viability, and nucleated red blood cells (NRBC).
STT1/stt1::HIS3 diploid cells were more sensitive to staurosporine than STT1/STT1 diploid cells.
Adipose Stromal Cells from Visceral and Subcutaneous Fat Facilitate Migration of Ovarian Cancer Cells via IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 Pathway.
Immunostaining showed HGF-positive melanocytes with varying levels of expression, and HGF protein was detected throughout the whole cell.
Alpha1-antitripsin is synthesized by epithelial cells, macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils.
Effects of CTGF/Hcs24, a hypertrophic chondrocyte-specific gene product, on the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblastic cells in vitro.
Blocking TLT2 on the macrophage surface by either specific anti-TLT2 Ab or soluble TLT2 extracellular domain attenuated the enhanced ability of macrophages with TLR3 activation to engulf apoptotic cells.
Immune traits measured included total and differential white blood cell counts, peripheral blood mononuclear leucocyte (PBML) subsets (CD4+ cells, total CD8alpha+ cells, classical CD8alphabeta+ cells, CD11R1+ cells (CD8alpha+ and CD8alpha-), B cells, monocytes and CD16+ cells) and acute phase proteins (alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP), haptoglobin, C-reactive protein (CRP) and transthyretin).
Fibroblastic cells are stained negative for TRPM8.
NOS2 is expressed predominantly by macrophages and lymphocytes.
STAT3 as a potential therapeutic target in ALDH+ and CD44+/CD24+ stem cell-like pancreatic cancer cells.
Specifically, chimeras were generated with aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) positive hematopoietic and parenchymal cells (Ahr+/+ animal bone marrow cells into irradiated Ahr+/+ animals), AHR positive hematopoietic and negative parenchymal cells (Ahr+/+ into Ahr-/-), AHR negative hematopoietic and positive parenchymal cells (Ahr-/- into Ahr+/+), and AHR negative hematopoietic and parenchymal cells (Ahr-/- into Ahr-/-).
