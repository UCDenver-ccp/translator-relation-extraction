Bcl2 is critical in osteoclasts but not osteoblasts.
Fluorescent co-labeling of TRPV1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) identified most glial cells expressing TRPV1 to be astrocytes.
Using mice selectively lacking TLR4 in enterocytes (TLR4(?IEC)) and in TLR4-deficient cultured enterocytes, we now show that TLR4 activation induces autophagy in enterocytes.
Our results suggest that MMP-9 protein in coculture medium originated from monocytes and macrophages but activation required chondrocyte-derived factors.
In Jab1 cKO chondrocytes, there was heightened expression of BMP signaling components including Gdf10/Bmp3b and of BMP targets during chondrocyte hypertrophy such as Ihh.
Positive staining for the GDF9 protein was identified in oocytes and granulosa cells in all samples tested.
Cbfa1 does not regulate RANKL gene activity in stromal/osteoblastic cells.
Distinct pathways regulated by menin and by MLL1 in hematopoietic stem cells and developing B cells.
Analysis of BMP9 expression reveals that BMP9 is produced by hepatocytes and intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells.
GDF9 and BMP15 are expressed specifically in mammalian oocytes and also participate in cumulus-oocyte crosstalk.
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a pluripotent secreted protein that stimulates a wide array of cellular targets, including hepatocytes and other epithelial cells, melanocytes, endothelial and haematopoietic cells.
The tumor cells composing microtumors were negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a specific marker of astrocytic cells, and Leu 7, a marker of oligodendrocytes, while cells of macrotumors were positive for either GFAP or Leu 7, showing characteristics of mature glial cells.
CP5 and CP8 trigger KB cells to produce interleukin-8 (IL-8); endothelial cells to produce IL-8 and IL-6; and monocytes to produce IL-8, IL-6, IL-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha.
NSE, nestin, and GFAP were positive in these neuron-like cells.
However, gammadelta+ T cells predominantly expressed transforming growth factor beta2 and granulocyte monocyte-colony stimulating factor.
Erythrocyte intercellular adhesion molecule-4 (ICAM-4) binds alphaV-integrins, including alphaVbeta3 on endothelial cells.
Further study indicated that the mucin hyperproduction was significantly linked to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and/or CD68+ monocyte macrophages.
Lyn expression was higher in injured CD36ko, and cell type-specific patterns of Lyn expression were altered; Lyn was expressed in endothelial cells and microglia in WT but predominantly in dying neurons in CD36ko.
However, a very small numbers of the cells expressed GFAP, a marker for astrocytes, O4, a marker for immature oligodendrocytes, and betaIII-tubulin, a marker for neurons.
Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) are widely expressed on primary sensory neuron endings and non-neuronal cells such as keratinocytes.
