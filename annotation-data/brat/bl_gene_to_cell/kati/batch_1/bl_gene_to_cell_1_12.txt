The neuronal protein BM88/Cend1 has been implicated in coordination of cell cycle exit and differentiation of neuronal precursors.
IL-1beta protein expression was induced in macrophages in the meningis and perivascular space after leptin treatment, whereas COX-2 induction was observed in endothelial cells, indicating the roles for these non-neuronal cells in mediating inflammatory actions of leptin.
Id2 and Id3 mRNA+ cells were identified as GFAP+ and S100 alpha + astrocytes as well as ED1+ microglia.
Increased phosphorylation of ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins contributes to proliferation of rheumatoid fibroblast-like synoviocytes.
CD52 is expressed on normal lymphocytes, monocytes, and some dendritic cell subsets.
Three mixed tumors were identified with Olig2+ (oligodendrocytes) and Iba-1+ (macrophage/microglia) cell populations.
Cyclin M1 (CNNM1) functions as a copper storage protein in neuronal cells.
CD68 is a member of the lysosome associated membrane protein (LAMP) family that is restricted in its expression to cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage.
By contrast, galectin 3-induced secretion of TNFalpha, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5 was significantly greater in synovial fibroblasts than in skin fibroblasts.
Double immunofluorescence labeling revealed that ATG16L1 was abundantly expressed in phagocytic cells (CD68), endothelial cells (CD31), and mast cells (tryptase) in human advanced plaques.
However, myogenin(+) myoblasts (i.e., myocytes) and myotubes abundantly express S100B likely induced by myogenin.
H-CFUs expressed markers of embryonic hepatocytes (alpha-fetoprotein, albumin and cytokeratin 8/18), biliary cells (cytokeratin 19), hepatocyte functional proteins (transthyretin and cytochrome P450-2b1), and hepatocyte nuclear factors 1alpha and -3beta).
T1R3 and GLUT2 are predominantly expressed in subsets of solitary chemoreceptor cells (SCCs) and ciliated cells, GLUT5 is present in subsets of SCCs and in secretory cells, and SGLT1 is exclusively expressed in a unique cell type, SCCs.
In bone marrow, p21 was immunostained almost exclusively in a subset of megakaryocytes and p27 protein was present in megakaryocytes, plasma cells, and endothelial cells.
TIS1 and TIS21 protein levels were also greater in TPA-treated P-cells than P+ cells.
Alloantigen specific CD8+CD28- FOXP3+ T suppressor cells induce ILT3+ ILT4+ tolerogenic endothelial cells, inhibiting alloreactivity.
Inflammatory cells involved in the allergic response, including eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, and neutrophils, express sialoglycan-binding proteins such as Siglec-8 and Siglec-9, which inhibit cell function and survival.
Flow cytometric analysis enabled the discrimination between PI+/CD45- targets, PI-/CD45+ phagocytes, and PI+/CD45+ phagocytes with engulfed targets.
Three distinct stages of astrocytic differentiation were identified during development: i) Pax2+/vimentin+/GFAP- APCs; ii) Pax2+/vimentin+/GFAP+ immature perinatal astrocytes; and iii) Pax2+/vimentin-/GFAP+ mature perinatal astrocytes.
This confirmed the significant up-regulation of serpin H1, 14-3-3 protein sigma, and stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 in tumorous cholangiocytes relative to normal hepatocytes and non-tumorous cholangiocytes, whereas some proteins were detectable specifically in hepatocytes.
