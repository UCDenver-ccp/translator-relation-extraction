Developing and mature sympathetic neurons synthesize BDNF, and preganglionic neurons express the full-length BDNF/TrkB receptor.
Only the CD11c+ DC expressed macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor and gave rise to CD14+, esterase+, phagocytic macrophages when cultured in M-CSF.
Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy revealed ARRB1 and ARRB2 expression by monocytes and T cells, with a selective decrease in ARRB2 expression in monocytes during acute rejection.
The exacerbation was accompanied with reduced CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T cells, increased CD4(+)CXCR5(+) T cells, B cells, dendritic cells and antigen-specific autoantibodies, which is possibly due to the inhibition of IL-2 induced by CGS21680.
The TNF-alpha response, CD14+ monocyte number, and CD14 expression level on monocytes were significantly increased in the weeks close to parturition.
Using CXCR3-173 mAb, we demonstrate CXCR3 expression on primary memory phenotype CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, naturally occurring CD4+CD25+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, natural killer T cells, and approximately 25% of NK cells.
Monocytes were divided into classical monocytes (CM, CD14++CD16-), intermediate monocytes (IM, CD14++CD16+), and non-classical monocytes (NCM, CD14+CD16++).
Virus bound to both CD4-positive (CD4(+)) and CD4-negative (CD4(-)) cells, including neutrophils, Raji cells, tonsil mononuclear cells, erythrocytes, platelets, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), although virus bound at significantly higher levels to PBMC.
TNF-alpha is a protein elaborated by monocytes and macrophages in response to endotoxin.
Expansion of Valpha24(+)Vbeta11(+) NKT cells from cord blood mononuclear cells using IL-15, IL-7 and Flt3-L depends on monocytes.
Interleukin-1 beta upregulates tissue-type plasminogen activator in a keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT).
Macrophages also were labeled for CLC protein within endocytotic-lysosomal structures; neutrophilic myelocytes did not contain CLC protein.
The frequencies of L-selectin+ CD4+ T cells or L-selectin+ CD8+ T cells from patients with psoriasis were almost normal.
It is most intensely expressed by the most immature thymus T-lineage cells and is more intensely expressed by CD34-positive/CD33-positive myeloid cells (compared to more mature myeloid cells) and the earliest CD34-positive/CD10-positive B-cell precursor cells (compared to cells of later B-cell precursor stages).
SM of both groups displayed a distinct mononuclear cell infiltration, with CD14(+) macrophages being the major cell population, followed by CD4(+) T cells and only small numbers of CD8(+) T, CD19(+) B and CD16(+) CD56(+) natural killer (NK) cells.
Lysed neutrophils inhibited RV16-induced IL-6 and CXCL8 from monocytes.
In both T cells and NK cells, IL-2 induces the activation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5.
Inefficient reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes using Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5.
Differentiation of oval cells into basophilic hepatocytes resulted in their expression of Cx32 and Cx26.
A number of (non-chimeric) subpopulations of bone marrow cells including CD34(+) stem cells and the CD34(-) early progeny like CD38(+), CD2(+), CD5(+) and CD1(+) lymphoid cells as well as CD33(+) (but CD15(-)) myeloid cells down-regulated the MLR and CML responses of allogeneic PBMC stimulated with (autologous) donor spleen cells.
