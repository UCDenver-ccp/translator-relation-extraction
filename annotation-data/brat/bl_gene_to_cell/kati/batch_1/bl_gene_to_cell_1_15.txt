Hair cells are known to express Notch ligands Dll1 and Jag2, which signal through Notch1 in adjacent supporting cells.
Galectin-1 preferentially bound to neutrophils, plasma cells and enterocytes, while galectin-3 binding sites were mainly distributed on macrophages and intraepithelial lymphocytes.
Determination of GTP loading on Rac and Cdc42 in platelets and fibroblasts.
The CD11b-positive cell population was initially formed of arginase-1- and CD206-positive M2 microglia/macrophages, which later shifted towards iNOS- and CD16/32-positive M1 microglia/macrophages.
In the presence of both pericytes and astrocytes rat brain endothelial cells expressed enhanced levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins occludin, claudin-5 and ZO-1 with a typical localization at the cell borders.
All extrathymic T cells in the liver, intestine, and even other organs were CD44+ L-selectin-LFA-1++ICAM-1+, whereas thymocytes and thymus-derived T cells were CD44-L-selectin+LFA-1+ICAM-1-.
Convulxin induced surface expression of P-selectin in SLP-76(+/-) platelets, but not SLP-76(-/-) platelets (P <.01), and failed to stimulate annexin V binding to either SLP-76(+/-) or SLP-76(-/-) platelets.
Further detected was the percentage of CD16+ M1, CD23+ M1, CD10+ M2 and CCL22+ M2 cells in monocyte derived macrophages.
The histiocytic cells stained positively with S-100 protein and CD68.
Soluble CX3CL1 chemoattracts and activates CX3CR1+ leukocytes such as CD8+, CD4+, and ?? T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and monocytes/macrophages.
The cytosolic adaptor protein ADAP (adhesion and degranulation promoting adapter protein) is expressed by T cells, natural killer cells, myeloid cells and platelets.
Monocytes and culture-derived-M1-M2 macrophages phagocytosed platelets, with the phagocytic potential of culture-derived-M1 macrophages higher than M2 involving CXCR4-CXCR7 participation.
Finally, we observed that CCL4, CXCL1 and CXCL8 secretion, following PROK1 induction, is only observed in monocytes and not in monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells.
Each cell type secreted interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in PRP hydrogels, but mesenchymal stem cells secreted less interleukin-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 than tenocytes or skin fibroblasts.
CD14 glycoprotein expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells.
Immunofluorescence double staining showed that B7-H4 was expressed chiefly on CD3(+)  T cells, CD68(+)  macrophages, CK-18(+)  bile ducts, and CD31(+)  endothelial cells, while B7-H3 was found on all cell types detected.
Expression of germ cell-specific proteins such as POU5F1, DAZL, TNP1, TNP2, PRM1 and PRM2 revealed that, although proliferating and differentiating spermatogenic germ cells such as spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids could survive in autografts until 4 weeks, only terminally differentiated germ cells such as sperm persisted in autografts until 8 weeks.
Th1 cells secrete IL-2 and IFN-gamma but Th2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10.
The data demonstrate that CD45?/CD31+/VEGFR2? LSP cells differentiated into CD45?/CD31+/VEGFR2+ LSP cells and then endothelial cells, indicating that CD45?/CD31+/VEGFR2+ LSP cells are likely to be derived from CD45?/CD31+/VEGFR2? LSP cells.
Macrophages secrete lactadherin, a PS-binding protein, which tethers apoptotic cells to macrophage integrins.
