Transient exposure to HIV-1 Tat protein results in cytokine production in macrophages and astrocytes.
Unlike S100 protein, microtubule-associated proteins 5 and tau were neuron specific and were absent from glial cells.
Multimerin 1 is a stored platelet and endothelial cell adhesive protein that shows significant conservation.
The frequency of cells harbouring integrated HIV DNA was inversely associated with current CD4 T-cell count and positively associated with CCR5+ CD4 T cells, CXCR3+CCR6+ and CXCR3+CCR6- expression on total memory CD4 T cells (P?<?0.001, 0.048, 0.015, and 0.016, respectively).
Infiltrating inflammatory cells such as macrophages and scleral fibroblasts were the primary source of MMP-3 and TIMP-1 expression.
Desialylated cells formed TRAP-positive mononuclear cells, but did not become multinuclear cells despite the normal expression of osteoclast markers such as cathepsin K, integrin beta3, and nuclear factor-ATc1.
Mutation of BRINP1-NRSE recovered the BRINP1 promoter activity in non-neuronal cells.
The chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR5 are expressed on activated T lymphocytes, and expression of CXCR3 by mesangial cells has been suggested.
IL-10, IL-24 and IL-26 were produced by both monocytes and T cells, IL-19 and IL-20 were produced by monocytes whereas IL-22 was produced mainly by activated T cells.
CD14 represents the most specific marker for monocytes/macrophages.
Using immunohistochemistry, the distribution of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), mast cells, CD3+ T cells, including the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, CD20+ B cells, CD38+ plasma cells and CD68+ macrophages, was analysed at lobar, segmental and distal levels of the bronchial tree.
Decreased density of the CCR5 receptor on the surface of CD4+ lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages is associated with the CCR5-59653T transition in the promoter region.
ApoE is a polymorphic protein produced primarily in macrophages and astrocytes.
These fibroblast-like, colony forming and plastic adherent cells expressed putative stem cell markers Notch-1 and Nestin.
Moreover, in a series of six patients treated with myeloablative chemoradiotherapy, early hematopoietic recovery of marrow functions was predicted more accurately by the number of transplanted CD34+/CD33+ cells than by either total nucleated cells, CFU-GM, CD34+/CD33- cells, or CD34-/CD33+ cells.
Using antibody-based techniques, increased levels of sICAM1, of CXCL1- and CXCL8-attracting neutrophils, of CXCL10- and CCL4-attracting T helper (Th) 1 cells, and of CCL2- and CCL4-attracting monocytes and dendritic cells were observed.
The CD4+ lymphocytes exhibited a higher MRP protein expression than the other cell lineages, including CD8+ cells.
Astrocytes in culture, similar to reactive astrocytes in vivo, express three intermediate filament proteins: GFAP, vimentin, and nestin.
Using a PCR-STR technique CD3(+)/CD4(+) (T4 lymphocytes), CD3(+)/CD8(+) (T8 lymphocytes), CD45(+)/CD19(+) (B lymphocytes), CD45(+)/CD14(+) (monocytes), CD45(+)/CD15(+) (granulocytes) and CD3(-)/CD56(+) (NK-cells) were analyzed.
OP-9 cells are stromal cells derived from macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-deficient osteopetrotic mice.
