VEGFR-1 is required for the recruitment of haematopoietic stem cells and the migration of monocytes and macrophages, VEGFR-2 regulates vascular endothelial function and VEGFR-3 regulates lymphatic endothelial cell function.
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether ACE2 overexpression could protect human monocyte cell line (THP-1) macrophages from angiotensin II-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) formation.
Cell surface expression of B7-H2 protein is detected in monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells.
CXCL16 was expressed in glomerular endothelial cells and mediated adhesion of macrophages expressing CXCL16 and its cognate receptor, CXCR6.
Sox6 is expressed in Tuj1 positive neurons, suggesting that Sox6 is expressed in differentiating neurons.
However, macrophages in the latter chimeras retain phagocytic activity against CD47(null) RBCs, demonstrating a split macrophage tolerance to CD47(null) hematopoietic cells.
Adipocyte-fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP) is a circulating protein expressed in adipocytes and macrophages.
The Th17 cells were derived only from cells expressing both CCR6 and CCR4 whereas the Th1 cells, secreting IFN?, were derived from cells lacking CCR6 and CCR4.
These neuron-like cells could be marked by neuron markers like nestin and MAP2.
In the thymic medullary PVS, S1P lyase was expressed in ER-TR7-positive cells (reticular fibroblasts and pericytes) and CD31-positive vascular endothelial cells.
To determine whether the granule neurons respond directly to BDNF, we analyzed the induction of the Fos protein in these neurons.
COX2 expression is reported in epithelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages and endothelial cells of Apc(+/-) mouse polyps.
PDLIM5 is not a neuronal CaV2.2 adaptor protein.
Moreover, OA osteoblasts produced five times more HGF than normal osteoblasts and almost no HGF/NK1, unlike normal osteoblasts.
This study has shown that rab1, rab3B, rab4, rab6, and rab8 proteins, but not rab3A protein, were present in platelets and in endothelial cells.
Neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (Npas4) controls neuronal homeostasis in pentylenetetrazole-induced epilepsy through the induction of Homer1a.
IL-16, IL-10 and miR-145 expression in THP1 monocytes and induced macrophages was quantified by quantitative PCR.
CD44 and LFA-1 were expressed on lymphocytes, macrophages, and synovial (ST) lining cells.
Significant preoperative differences were observed in leukocytes, lymphocytes, alkaline phosphatase,ICAM-3 and VCAM-1 (p<0.05).
Unstimulated microglia promoted expression of tight junction proteins (TJPs), zonula ocluden-1 (ZO-1) and occludin in co-cultured endothelia cells, whereas A?-stimulated microglia reduced endothelial expression of ZO-1 and occludin.
