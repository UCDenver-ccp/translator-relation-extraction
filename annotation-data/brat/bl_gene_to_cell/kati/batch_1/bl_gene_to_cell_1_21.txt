The neuroblastic cells were generally positive for neuron-specific enolase and synaptophysin, but were intermixed with glia-like tumor cells positive for vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and S-100 protein.
Gas3/PMP22 can regulate apoptosis and cell spreading in cultured cells.
ERK1/2 and p38 proteins regulate STAT3 expression in SKOV3 cells, while STAT3 may be pivotal to the proliferation of SKOV3 cells in vitro.
While ataxin-3 was expressed only in hippocampal neurons, GFAP was detected in reactive astrocytes.
Blood lymphocyte counts were determined, and flow cytometry was used to measure proportions of B cells (CD19+), natural killer (NK) cells (CD16+CD56+), T cells (CD3+), CD4+ T cell subsets (memory CD4+CD45RO+; naive CD4+CD45RO-; Th0/Th2CD4+CD7-; activated CD4+CD25+), and CD8+ T cell subsets (immunoregulatory CD8+CD57+; cytotoxic CD8+S6F1+, activated CD8+CD25+).
Tlr9-/- as compared to Tlr9wt/wt adipocytes exhibit increased resistin and MCP1 secretion and reduced adiponectin secretion into cell culture supernatants, while TLR9 ligands (ODNs) show differential effects in Tlr9-/- vs Tlr9wt/wt primary murine adipocytes.
Chemotaxis of THP-1 monocytic cells towards monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 was determined using a Boyden chamber.
Cells were stained for the stem cells markers, nestin, vimentin, ABCG2, and Sca-1.
CCAAT/enhancer binding protein delta (CEBPD) elevating PTX3 expression inhibits macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of dying neuron cells.
Mean proportion of CD14 positive macrophages was 6%, and of CD54 positive macrophages - 62%.
alpha1-Antichymotrypsin interaction with cationic proteins from granulocytes.
CD11b/CD18 and CD11c/CD18 are more restricted antigens normally expressed on monocytes, macrophages, PMN and natural killer cells.
PTHrP signals regulate HDAC4-MEF2C axis in chondrocyte.
Transcription factors GATA-1 and Fli-1 regulate human HOXA10 expression in megakaryocytic cells.
TNF-alpha may also play a role in the recruitment of osteoclasts because TRAP-positive osteoclasts appeared after TNF-alpha expression.
15d-PGJ(2) blocked IL-6 induced Stat1 and Stat3 activation in primary human lymphocytes, Jurkat cells and immortalized rheumatoid arthritis B cells.
Tusc5 mRNA was markedly increased from trace levels in pre-adipocytes to significant levels in developing 3T3-L1 adipocytes, coincident with several mature adipocyte markers (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1, GLUT4, adipsin, leptin).
Ultrastructurally, these CD34+ cell-derived osteoblasts displayed osteoblast-specific features.
Studies of cell lines representing endocrine, fibroblast, and lymphoid lineages using polyclonal antisera to detect E2A proteins have suggested that significant E2A protein expression is restricted to B-lymphocytes.
Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (PECAM-1/CD31): A Multifunctional Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule.
