In contrast to circulating CD34+ B cells, CD34- B cells in MM are diploid.
PPE57 interacts directly with TLR2 on macrophages.
In the present study, gene expression of the cell surface markers CD68 and CD14 (expressed on monocytes and macrophages), Mac-1 (CD11b) (expressed on granulocytes, monocytes and NK cells) and CD16 (expressed on neutrophils) was investigated in murine CGR8 ES cells in relation to the endothelial cell markers CD31 and vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin.
Go6976 abrogates GPVI-mediated platelet functional responses in human platelets through inhibition of Syk.
CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, and eosinophil and neutrophil granulocytes were significantly reduced in post-treatment tacrolimus specimens, while CD1a+ cells and mast cells were not.
Fetal type II cells expressed significantly more ErbB1, ErbB2, and ErbB3 protein than fibroblasts.
As markers of leukocyte activation, we measured plasma lactoferrin, elastase and granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor.
Macrophage-inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) is a product of activated monocytes and macrophages and an important activator of T cells, monocytes, and macrophages.
Th9 and Th17 cells were significantly elevated in co-cultures of CD4+ Th cells and keratinocytes, and MMP9, IL-9, and IL-17 levels were simultaneously increased.
Secretion of Ccl3 was documented only in microglia, whereas both microglia and retinal pigment epithelium cells produced Ccl2.
Androgens decrease plasma adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipocyte-derived protein.
In retinal neurons the expression of PPT1 precedes that of the synaptic vesicle protein 2 and synaptophysin, indicating a significant role for PPT1 in the early development of neuronal cells.
Specifically, the circulating monocyte-macrophage cells and their CD13, CD15 and CD33 subsets, serum cytokines (IL-8, GM-CSF and TNF-alpha) and the NK cells were analyzed.
Annexin 2 was overexpressed twofold in SaOSLM2 osteoblastic cells as a fusion protein with green fluorescent protein.
Autologous Th17 cells promoted inflammatory and antigen-presenting functions of GO fibrocytes; conversely, fibrocytes enhanced Th17 cell-function and recruited Th17 cells in a macrophage inflammatory protein 3 (MIP-3)/CCR6-dependent manner.
Finally, safflower seed oil, but not LA, caused an increase in the number of oligodendrocytes (MBP+), astrocytes (GFAP+) and neurons (?-III tubulin+) of which only the increase in ?-III tubulin positive cells was statistically significant.
Urinary leukocytes, erythrocytes, bacteria, or protein content did not affect the Gb3-24:18 isoform ratio.
Compared with macrophage CSF-differentiated macrophages, granulocyte/macrophage CSF-matured macrophages exhibited reduced MMP-14 mRNA levels but increased protein expression and activity, which resulted in heightened macrophage invasion.
SH2D1A and SLAM protein expression in human lymphocytes and derived cell lines.
IL-4 inhibits TGF-beta-induced Foxp3+ T cells and, together with TGF-beta, generates IL-9+ IL-10+ Foxp3(-) effector T cells.
