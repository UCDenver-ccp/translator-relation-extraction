Interestingly, YAP1 was predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas WWTR1 was nuclear in oocytes and somatic cells.
Post-translational Modifications of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 Complex in Lymphocytes and Activated B-Cell Like Subtype of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.
fibroblast-like cells from the joint could transform into osteoblasts under the effect of BMP-2 or BMP-2 with TGF-beta(1).
Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide reduces melanogenesis by inhibiting the paracrine effects of keratinocytes and fibroblasts via IL-6/STAT3/FGF2 pathway.
In the NK cells, Leu7+ CD16-cells were elevated, whereas Leu7+CD16+ cells and Leu7-CD16+ cells were normal.
Induction of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(-) regulatory T cells by Thy-1 stimulation of CD4(+) T cells.
Jagged1, Notch1, and Hesr2/Hey2, which are known to be detected in both immature endothelial cells and mural cells, were expressed in stromal cells of all cases.
Therefore, adiponectin-stimulated induction of CXCL8 seems to be tightly controlled in primary human hepatocytes, whereas neither NF-kappaB, STAT3, nor CXCL8 are influenced in hepatocytic cell lines.
Normal human monocytes were demonstrated to be DAF+/CD14+, whereas PNH monocytes consisted of subpopulations of DAF+/CD14+ and DAF-/CD14-.
Adrenomedullin and adrenomedullin binding protein-1 downregulate TNF-alpha in macrophage cell line and rat Kupffer cells.
Neurons generated from APP/APLP1/APLP2 triple knockout embryonic stem cells behave normally in vitro and in vivo: lack of evidence for a cell autonomous role of the amyloid precursor protein in neuronal differentiation.
Brain cell-type specific expression profiling libraries reveal that SEMA4A, SLC25A44 and PMF1 at 1q22 and COL4A1 and COL4A2 at 13q34 were mainly expressed in endothelial cells, while the genes at 2q33 (FAM117B, CARF and NBEAL1) were expressed in various cell types including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons.
Conditioned medium from luminal mammary epithelial HC11 cell cultures was chemo-attractive to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells, B cells, macrophages, monocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils.
CD62P expression and differentiated platelet-leukocyte conjugates (CD45, CD14, CD41) as well as microparticles and platelet-platelet aggregates were detected flow cytometrically with and without TRAP-6-stimulation.
mRNA and protein levels for VDR, PDIA3, and osteoblast-associated proteins were measured in undifferentiated cells and in cells treated with osteogenic medium.
In immature hepatic arteries, endothelial cells expressed VEGFR-1, whereas mural cells expressed both Tie-2 and Angiopoietin-2.
The inflammatory process in atherogenesis involves a variety of immune cells including monocytes/macrophages, lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, which all express peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-? (PPAR-?).
Secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1, osteopontin) binds to integrin alpha v beta 6 on porcine trophectoderm cells and integrin alpha v beta 3 on uterine luminal epithelial cells, and promotes trophectoderm cell adhesion and migration.
The level of CD4+CD25+CD127(low/-) T cell was positively correlated with the levels of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T cells and CD4+CD25high T cell (both P < 0.01).
Endogenous IgG exudation, neutrophils and macrophages/microglia accumulation, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) protein expression were determined by immunohistochemistry 72 h after reperfusion.
