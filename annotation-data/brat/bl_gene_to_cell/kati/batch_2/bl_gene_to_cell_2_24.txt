LPS activated NF-kappaB by 3-4-fold in wt cells but by 9-10-fold in p60-/-, p80-/-, and p60-/- p80-/- macrophages.
Microarray analysis demonstrated that stem cell-related genes, including Tcf15, Gbx2, Lrh1, Zic3, and Baf60c, were significantly repressed in Etv4/5 dKO ES cells.
Colocalization of lymphocytes bearing gamma delta T-cell receptor and heat shock protein hsp65+ oligodendrocytes in multiple sclerosis.
Moreover, effective Schwann cell remyelination represented by periaxin- and P0-positive mature myelinating Schwann cells, was strikingly associated with the presence of p75NTR/Sox2-expressing Schwann cells.
SMAD-PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway mediates BMP-7 polarization of monocytes into M2 macrophages.
Akt1/protein kinase B enhances transcriptional reprogramming of fibroblasts to functional cardiomyocytes.
In addition, CCR8-/- macrophages produced significantly higher levels than CCR8+/+ macrophages of several cytokines and chemokines known to augment bactericidal activities of leukocytes that include TNF-alpha, IL-12, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2, and KC.
Oocytes expressed Epb4.1l3, not Rgs11, and Pvr only in in vitro-grown oocytes.
BLT1 expression is highest in CD14+ monocytes, while BLT2 expression is high in CD8+ cytotoxic T-, CD4+ helper T-, and CD19+ B-cells.
BDNF localization in STX1B(-/-) glial cells was disrupted, and BDNF secretion from STX1B(-/-) glial cells was impaired.
Distinct intrathymic B cell subpopulations were identified, namely B220+, IgM+, CD23(hi), CD21(int) cells; B220+, IgM+, CD23(lo), CD21(lo) cells; and a population of B220+, IgM+, CD23(lo), CD21(hi) cells.
T lymphocytes constitutively express TASK1 and -3 protein.
Chemokine receptors CCR2, CCR5 and CXCR3 are involved in the regulation of macrophage- and T cell-mediated immune responses and in the migration and activation of these cells.
