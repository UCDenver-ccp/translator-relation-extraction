To determine their ability to differentiate into osteoclasts, NCD14+ monocytes were further cultured with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) together with RANKL or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha).
IL-19 protein was positively stained in 15 healthy tissue types and three major cell types: epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and macrophages.
CD34+ cell-derived hematopoietic precursors amplified with FLT3-ligand, thrombopoietin and stem cell factor became, after a 6-day induction with GM-CSF, IL-4 and TGF-beta1, HLA-DR+, CD1a+, CD83-, CD86-, CD80- cells.
We recently demonstrated that stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) forms complexes with CXCR4, but also with syndecan-4 expressed by human primary lymphocytes and macrophages, and HeLa cells.
No significant differences between groups were found in the levels of TNF?, IgG, IL-10, IL-8, leucocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, Th cells or B cells.
Tim-3 was expressed by macrophages, dendritic, natural killer, as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
The glycoprotein CD36, also known as glycoprotein IIIb/IV or FAT, is expressed on the surface of platelets, monocytes, microvascular endothelial cell, smooth muscle cells, cardiomyocytes and other cells of the cardiovascular system.
Antibodies included anti-CD18 (a panleukocyte marker), anti-MHC class II (detects most B and T lymphocytes and monocyte/macrophages), anti-Thy-1 (a pan-T-lymphocyte and monocyte/macrophage marker), anti-CD3 (a pan-T-lymphocyte marker), anti-CD21 (a B-lymphocyte marker), and anti-CD14 (a monocyte/macrophage marker).
Cell survival and expression of MCT4, MCT2, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and neuronal nuclear antigen were evaluated.
ACKR2 and ACKR3 mRNA and ACKR4 protein were mainly localized to luminal epithelial cells and weakly to glandular epithelial cells in the endometrium.
Insufficient apoptosis of fibroblast-like synoviocytes and inflammatory cells in RA could increase the expression of PDCD5 protein.
Compared with the non-CHB group, more CD68-positive macrophages, CD20-positive B cells, and CD15-positive neutrophils infiltrated the synovium in the CHB group (all p?<??0.05).
MDM2 protein was identified in CD14-positive and CD14-negative synovial lining cells and CD14-positive sublining cells.
Since regulatory T cells (Treg cells) may express receptors for specific chemokines, we cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells with supernatants of HT29 cells previously treated with Bifidobacterium strains and analyzed FOXP3 and CD25 Treg markers and CCR6, CXCR3, CCR4, and CCR3 expression on CD4(+) lymphocytes.
Astrocytes responded to the microglia-derived ATP via P2Y1 receptors and released interleukin-6 (IL-6), thereby protecting neurons against MeHg(low).
Following PMA treatment of Dami cells, a megakaryoblastic cell line, we found that CIB1 protein expression increased concomitant with cell ploidy.
In addition, patients had a higher percentage of CD69(+), CD71(+) and CD98(+) T cell subsets and NK cells, and a reduced expression of L-selectin in CD14(high)CD16(+) monocytes and neutrophils, when compared to controls.
Reflecting this background, FL cells are immunohistochemically positive for BCL2 as well as GC B cell markers CD10 and BCL6.
P-selectin and MAC-1 mediate monocyte rolling and adhesion to ECM-bound platelets under flow conditions.
Human CCR4+ CCR6+ Th17 cells suppress autologous CD8+ T cell responses.
