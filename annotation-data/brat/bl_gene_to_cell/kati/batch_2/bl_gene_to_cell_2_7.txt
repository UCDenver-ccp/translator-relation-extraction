The detection of a small number of CD1a+/CD68+/BG+ dendritic epidermal cells may identify these cells as a link between the CD1a+/CD68+/BG+ Langerhans cells and the CD1a-/CD68+/BG- cell population and suggests that these cells represent a transitional form of myelomonocytic cells during their phenotypic and morphologic transformation into resident epidermal Langerhans cells.
Neurons generated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells demonstrate loss of the ANKS1B-encoded protein AIDA-1, a brain-specific protein highly enriched at neuronal synapses.
Cbl-/- macrophages form denser colonies and, at limiting CSF-1 concentrations, proliferate faster than Cbl+/+ macrophages.
Unexpectedly, CXCL12 selectively down-regulated CXCR4 on transmigrating monocytes, but not T cells.
Furthermore, circulating P-selectin, interleukin-6 and myeloperoxidase were determined to estimate platelet, monocyte and granulocyte activities, respectively.
Expansion of total nucleate cells, CD34(+) cells and CD34(+) CD38(-) cells was investigated.
Transcriptional profiling demonstrated that Krt15+ basal cells are molecularly distinct from Krt15- basal cells.
S100A4 protein is present in low concentrations (2.1-15.7 ng/10(6) cells) in lymphocyte and neutrophil culture medium.
IL-16 was abundantly present in CD4(+) T cells, followed by CD20(+) B, CD8(+) T, CD83(+) dendritic cells, and Mac-1(+) microglia.
Several studies have reported that astrocytes express MCT4, whereas neurons express MCT2.
Protein 4.1, a multifunctional protein of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton: structure and functions in erythrocytes and nonerythroid cells.
Upregulated TLR4 was localized with CD11b(+)MHCII(+) cells but not with GFAP(+) astrocytes.
We previously demonstrated that monocytes/macrophages express RCAS1.
Transformed MDCK cells secrete elevated MMP1 that generates LAMA5 fragments promoting endothelial cell angiogenesis.
Stem cell-specific expression of Dax1 is conferred by STAT3 and Oct3/4 in embryonic stem cells.
Histopathological and immunohistochemistry procedures were done in order to get a panel of inflammatory positive cells for CD3 (T lymphocytes), CD45RA (B lymphocytes), CD18 (beta 2 integrin), CD163 (ED2 protein), CD54 (ICAM-1), and MAC 387 (monocytes and macrophages).
Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were strongly positive for histiocytic markers: CD163, CD68, lysozyme, and PU.1, as well as strongly positive for dendritic cell markers: S100 and fascin, but were negative for CD1a (Langerhans cell marker), CD21/CD35 (follicular dendritic cell markers), B-cell, and T cell markers.
Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is produced by endothelial cells and cardiac myocytes.
These cells expressed the stem cell markers Oct3/4, Nanog, Sox2, and SSEA-1.
By comparing the gene expression profiles of the activated microglia and infiltrating macrophages, we identified microglia-specific genes, including Ak1, Ctsf, Sall1, Phlda3, and Spns2.
