Tff3 is expressed in neurons and microglial cells.
Semaphorin profiling of periodontal fibroblasts and osteoblasts.
Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) is expressed in monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells.
In this study, we report that B cells can modulate thymic production of CD4+ Foxp3+ T cells (regulatory T cells [Tregs]).
Using neuron/microglia co-culture of mixed p53 genotype, we observed that both neurons and microglia require p53 for gp120 induced neuronal apoptosis.
Some bizarre astrocytes in PML exhibited AQP4 IR.
The selective CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) agonists, monokine induced by interferon-gamma (IFN- gamma)/CXC chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9), IFN-inducible protein 10/CXCL10, and IFN-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC)/CXCL11, attract CXCR3+ cells such as CD45RO+ T lymphocytes, B cells, and natural killer cells.
HIV-inductive cytokines include: TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, IL-1 and IL-6, which stimulate HIV-1 replication in T cells and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15, which upregulate HIV-1 in T cells, and macrophage-colony stimulating factor, which stimulates HIV-1 in MDM.
SP-A and SP-D directly interact with alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes.
After stimulation with endotoxin or endotoxin plus interferon-gamma, HIV-1-infected monocytes/macrophages produced amounts of TNF alpha, IL-6, GM-CSF, and IL-1 beta comparable to that of uninfected cells.
Leukocyte subsets ICD45hiCD14lo polymorphonuclear neutrophils, CD45hiCD14hi monocytes, CD45hiCD14- lymphocytes, CD3+CD4/CD8+ T cells, CD3-CD19+ B cells, CD3-CD16/CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells], and circulating cytokine levels [tumor necrosis factor-alpha, gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN), and interleukins (IL-2, IL-10, IL-12)] were followed.
Proteinase inhibitor 6 (PI-6) is a 42-kDa intracellular protein present in epithelial cells and endothelial cells.
Growth of normal melanocytes, nevus cells and primary melanoma cells is enhanced by insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in vitro.
NAC also resulted in significantly fewer macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils as well as IL-1 beta, keratinocyte cytokine (KC), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and IL-6 levels in BAL taken after reperfusion.
As with GFAP, which is an astrocyte-specific marker protein, PAD2 is distributed mainly in astrocytes.
A majority of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, or CD16+ peripheral blood lymphocytes but not CD19+ lymphocytes expressed CCR1.
JNK1 and JNK2 differently regulate IL-12 production in THP-1 macrophage cells.
Resting lymphocytes and monocytes expressed ICAM-2, while neutrophils did not.
To elucidate whether and to what extent CD34+ fibroblasts (so-called CD34+ fibrocytes, CD34+ dendritic cells, and CD34+ stromal cells) occur in normal human vocal folds and in Reinke's edema.
TIB-73 hepatocytes express TLR9 protein.
