The levels of CD4+CD25-Foxp3+ T cells and CD4+CD25+Foxp3- T cells in CD4+ T cells did not significantly change in the combined group.
Changes of Lgr5+ stem cell quantities were accompanied by alterations of paneth cells, indicating that Shp2/MAPK signaling might affect stem cell niches directly or via paneth cells.
The lymphocytes were examined for cell viability, cell apoptosis and mRNA expression levels of SelW and apoptosis-related genes (Bcl-2, Bax, Bak-1, caspase-3 and p53).
The rolling velocity of T cells on endothelial cells increased after treatment of endothelial cells with anti-E- or P-selectin Abs.
BEC1 protein was found to be expressed in T cells and macrophages, the major target cells of HIV-1.
4.1, GLAST1, GDNF, and S100 but not with microglial cell marker Iba1, myelin sheath marker MBP, and neuronal marker ?3-tubulin or phosphorylated CaMKII.
We have examined the expression of a gap junction protein, connexin32 (Cx32), in Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes.
Some epithelial markers, such as CLDN5, OCLN, DSG1 and TJP1, were expressed even higher in fibroblasts than in epithelial cells.
Monocytes and neutrophils form heterotypic aggregates with platelets initially via engagement of platelet surface P-selectin with leukocyte surface P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1).
Cell subpopulations of T (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+) and B lymphocytes (CD20+), natural killer cells (CD57+), tissue macrophages (CD68+) and dendritic cells (CD35+, S100+) were studied.
Cell-autonomous role of EphB2 and EphB3 receptors in the thymic epithelial cell organization.
In addition, astrocytes could augment Akt, Erk1/2, and p38 activation in neutrophils.
The phenotypic profile of CD34+ PB cells showed a substantial increase in the percentage of CD34+CD13+ and CD34+CD33+ cells (myeloid progenitors) and a corresponding decrease in the percentage of CD34+CD10+ and CD34+CD19+ cells (B lymphoid progenitors) compared with CD34+ BM cells.
The NFAT protein NFAT1 (NFATp) is expressed and functional in T cells, B cells, mast cells, and natural killer cells.
EEA1, a tethering protein of the early sorting endosome, shows a polarized distribution in hippocampal neurons, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts.
To investigate the mechanism of antirheumatic action of mizoribine (MZR), we examined the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and MMP-3 utilizing THP-1 derived macrophage-like cells (THP-1 macrophages) and human synovial fibroblasts (SFs).
Induced KLF2 deficiency in activated CD4(+) T cells led to increased Tfh cell generation and B cell priming, whereas KLF2 overexpression prevented Tfh cell production.
Relative HMGB1 expression seemed also to decrease during differentiation of CD34+ stem cells into dendritic cells.
Cdx4 and menin co-regulate Hoxa9 expression in hematopoietic cells.
CD14+CD16++ cells derived in vitro from peripheral blood monocytes exhibit phenotypic and functional dendritic cell-like characteristics.
