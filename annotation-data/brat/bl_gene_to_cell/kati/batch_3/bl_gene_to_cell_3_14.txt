Furthermore, the number of CD4+ cells (T helper cells, monocytes/ macrophages) and of CD11b+ cells (monocytes/macrophages) was significantly correlated with the level of monomorphic HLA class I expression.
Immunohistochemistry localized Cav3.1 to myometrial and vascular smooth muscle cells whilst Cav3.2 localized to vascular endothelial cells and invading leucocytes.
The conversion of Foxp3+ T cells into TFH cells requires the loss of Foxp3 expression and subsequent interaction with B cells.
Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo investigations revealed a unique T cell population, IL-10-producing CD3+CD4+LAG-3+CD49b+CD25-Foxp3- Tr1 cells, that was significantly increased without altering the Foxp3+ regulatory T cell population.
Astrocytes displayed characteristic astrocyte morphology and expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).
We observed the action of the main cells involved in the remodeling, the osteoblasts and the osteoclasts, following the reaction of the markers of their activity: osteoprotegerin, osteonectin, osteopontin.
Osteoclast-like cells were generated from murine bone marrow in the presence of RANKL and monocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF).
The colony stimulating factors (CSFs), granulocyte macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF), macrophage-CSF (M-CSF or CSF-1) and granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) were first identified as in vitro hematopoietic growth factors.
Some proteins were associated with two or three cell types, e.g., alpha 1-antitrypsin with neurons and glia, and transferrin and alpha 2HS-glycoprotein with neurons, glia, and endothelial cells.
An imbalance between frequency of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells and CCR4+ and CCR9+ circulating helper T cells is associated with active perennial allergic conjunctivitis.
CD4+, CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes, and CD68+ macrophages were observed at the site of needle penetration.
We utilized human primary monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages to study the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components (NLRP3, apoptosis-associated specklike protein, and caspase-1) and its downstream cytokine interleukin-1? (IL-1?).
Because monocytes normally express dysferlin, we hypothesized that monocyte/macrophage dysfunction in dysferlin-deficient patients might contribute to disease onset and progression.
All BMP antagonists except noggin were expressed in chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts.
Both EMR2 and CD97 are highly expressed in immune tissues; however, unlike CD97, which is ubiquitously expressed in most cell types, EMR2 expression is restricted to monocytes/M&phi; and granulocytes.
CD4(+) T cells were more sensitive than CD8(+) T cells or CD4(+)CD25(+) T regulatory cells.
Incubation of monocytes with purified rIFN-gamma and granulocyte macrophage-CSF, but not IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, or TNF-alpha, also resulted in significant increases in the number of monocytes mediating cytotoxicity, suggesting that cytotoxic ability at the single cell level may be influenced by factors which effect monocyte activation and differentiation, respectively.
DC-SIGN was expressed by 80% of CD68-positive macrophages, but not by CD83-positive, DC-LAMP-positive, or Fascin-positive cells.
Eosinophils were stained with anti-EG2, neutrophils with anti-NP57, mast cells with anti-AA1, T-lymphocytes with anti-CD4, CD8 and CD3, and macrophages with anti-CD68.
Specific antibodies against human alpha1-acid glycoprotein reacted with human lymphocytes, granulocytes, and monocytes.
