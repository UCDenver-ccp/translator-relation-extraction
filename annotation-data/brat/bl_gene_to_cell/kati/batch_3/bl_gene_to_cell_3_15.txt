Overexpression of Heme Oxygenase-1 elevated the proportion of CD4+CD25+CD127low/- regulatory T cells in CD4+ T cells, meanwhile, inhibition of Heme Oxygenase-1 decreased the proportion of CD4+CD25+CD127low/- regulatory T cells in CD4+ T cells as compared with mesenchymal stem cells alone.
CD4(+) T lymphocytes, CD20(+) B lymphocytes and VS38c(+) plasma cells were practically absent.
This protein is critical for establishing adult adipocyte number, and p27 knockout increases adult adipocyte number.
Fn14 and TWEAK are expressed in macrophages and smooth muscle cells in carotid atherosclerotic plaques.
Induction of CD36 and FABP4 expression in adipocyte-like cells and adipocytes may share a common pathway.
Interleukin-4 mediates STAT6 activation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes but not adipocytes.
However, many other cells express CXCR1/CXCR2, including epithelial, endothelial, fibroblasts and neurons, contributing to the biological effects of CXCL8.
Except for the well characterized BMP family proteins, including GDF9 and BMP15, oocytes are known to secrete oocyte secreted factors that are important for the regulation of cumulus cell survival and the maintenance of tertiary structure of cumulus cell-enclosed oocyte complexes (COCs).
To induce insulin resistance, skeletal muscle cells were incubated with human adipocyte-derived conditioned medium, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and chemerin.
CD4+CXCR5+ T cells activated CD27+IgG+ B cells via the secretion of IL-21.
Consistently, both SLC22A5/OCTN2 and SLC38A2/SNAT2 are induced during the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages at gene and protein levels.
When granule neurons are present, however, BDNF or NT-4 treatment leads to Purkinje cell loss.
HER2 was transferred from HER2+ breast cancer cells to monocytes and natural killer cells by trogocytosis.
FOXP3+CD4+CD25+ adaptive regulatory T cells express cyclooxygenase-2 and suppress effector T cells by a prostaglandin E2-dependent mechanism.
Decidual CD56+ cells did not express monocyte/macrophage markers, including CD14, CD64 and CD68.
ICAM1+ neutrophils promote chronic inflammation via ASPRV1 in B cell-dependent autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
Activation of synovial cell p38 MAP kinase by macrophage migration inhibitory factor.
The number of alpha-synuclein and caspase12 immunoreactive neurons increased gradually with age whereas the number of GRP78-labeled neurons remained stable.
Stat4, Stat6(-/-) lymphocytes fail to differentiate into interleukin (IL)-4-secreting Th2 cells.
Our findings indicate that low GRK2 in microglia/macrophages accelerates brain damage via a GRK2/p38/TNF-alpha-dependent pathway.
