Connexin 43 (Cx43) and the integrins E11/gp38, integrin-?, integrin-?, and CD44 are involved in cell-cell interactions necessary for osteocyte survival.
However, Heph protein was not detected in the crypt cell-like proliferating Caco-2 cell.
Here, we show that hamartin and tuberin play different roles in NGF-treated cultured neuronal cells PC12h.
Characterization of the CD49f+/CD44+/CD24- single-cell derived stem cell population in basal-like DCIS cells.
LT?RIg treatment decreased PD-L1 expression by blood endothelial cells, and decreased VCAM-1 while increasing CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL12, CCL5, CCL21 and IL-6 expression in fibroblastic reticular cells.
SDF-1 alpha was induced in reactive CXCR4-positive astrocytes near axotomized spinal cord motor neurons, consistent with autocrine SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling in these cells.
Interestingly, intracellular accumulation of insoluble misfolded tau protein in neurons was associated with overexpression of Hsp27 almost exclusively in reactive astrocytes, not in neurons.
Endothelial cell-derived VEGF signals through VEGFR1 and induces expression of Bcl-2 and the proangiogenic chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL8 in HNSCC cells.
CD4(+)CXCR5(+) T cells and CXCR5(+)ICOS(+) Tfh cells did not show differences.
Secreted phosphoprotein 1 stimulates macrophages to secrete monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, which then activates adjacent endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells.
We found that p15 was expressed in cells belonging to the granulocyte-monocyte lineage and in B and T lymphocytes, whereas erythroid and megakaryocytic cells were p15 negative.
beta-catenin and pan-cadherin staining was strongly positive in osteoclasts and osteoblasts, with expression being lost when bone cells differentiated into osteocytes.
Foxp3(-) macrophages acquired Foxp3 expression after activation, which conferred inhibitory properties that were indistinguishable from natural Foxp3(+) macrophages.
Cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage produce IGF-1 and recombinant IGF-1 promotes neuronal survival under identical conditions.
This protein is called neuronal Cdk5 activator, p25/35nck5a.
Osteoblasts co-cultured with CD61-negative cells showed no differences in collagen, OPG, or RANKL expression levels compared to osteoblasts cultured alone.
Both granulocyte- and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF and GM-CSF) markedly augmented the cytotoxic function.
Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 2 (TRKB), which regulates neuronal cell survival, differentiation and plasticity, was identified as highly overexpressed in the NGN3 positive cell transcriptome compared to NGN3 negative exocrine cells.
Osteoblasts regulate the number and activity of osteoclasts through expression of RANKL, osteoprotegerin (OPG), and macrophage-colony stimulation factor (M-CSF).
ELC attracted both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, particularly efficiently after activation with IL-2 or with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) plus IL-2, as well as CD19+ B cells, but not CD16+ NK cells, CD14+ monocytes or neutrophils.
