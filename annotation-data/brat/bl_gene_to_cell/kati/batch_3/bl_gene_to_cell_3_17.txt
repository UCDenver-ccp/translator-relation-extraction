Sinus lining cells presented a distinctive antigenic profile, sharing both endothelial cell (CD31, CD36, CD54, CD62P, CD102, CD105, CD106 and CD146) and macrophage lineage characteristics.
Platelet membrane glycoprotein Ib and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, P-selectin, platelet-derived microparticles, leukocyte CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1), and platelet-leukocyte aggregate were quantified by means of flow cytometry.
Nestin is a characteristic intermediate filament protein expressed in neural stem cells (NSCs).
The parameters measured were: total leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes from lymph nodes, serum cytokines (IL-2, IL-6 and TNF-alpha), lymphocyte mitochondrial transmembrane potential, viability and DNA fragmentation.
Addition of TGF-beta 1 to TNF-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage CSF, and stem cell factor-supplemented cultures had no significant effect on the proportions of cycling cells.
Specifically, dual labeling for nestin and MAP2 was used to distinguish neuronal stem cells and precursor cells from immature postmitotic neurons, and synapsin I and GAP43 immunostaining was used to distinguish neurons with established synaptic connections from developing neurons.
"Intracellular" accumulation of beta-catenin blocked differentiation of spatially-appropriate airway epithelial cell types, Clara cells, ciliated cells and basal cells, and activated UCHL1, a marker for pulmonary neuroendocrine cells.
Monocyte and lymphocyte L-selectin did not decrease.
Fertilization and development in the Atg7(d/d) oocytes were significantly lower than the Atg7(f/f) oocytes, comparable to the Atg5(d/d) oocytes previously described.
Secondary endpoints included experimental biomarkers such as CD154, toll-like receptor-4, memory B cells, FOXP3, and lymphocyte stimulation.
Neither CD3+ T lymphocytes nor CD68+ macrophages were positive for CXCR1.
CD34+/CD133+/VEGFR-3+ lymphatic endothelial progenitor cells from peripheral blood may differentiate into lymphatic endothelial cells.
Neurons expressing both trkA and trkC or neurons expressing neither trkA nor trkC had no significant alteration in phospho-ERK1/2.
These cells expressed lymphocyte function-associated Ag-1 (LFA-1).
It is probably identical to monocyte-macrophage PAI.
The differentially expressed genes such as IFI16, EGR1, NFYA, FOXP1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CXCL8 confirmed the commitment of K562 cells to the monocyte/macrophage lineage.
Only occasional CD15- or lactoferrin-positive neutrophils and CD25-positive lymphocytes could be detected.
Interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 potentiate interleukin-1 induced secretion of interleukin-6 in human osteoblast-like cells.
HMGB1 correlated to LBP, IL-6, C-reactive protein, white blood cell count and neutrophils (P < 0.001).
Recipient mice that had undergone transfer of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ CXCR3-transfected T cells (CXCR3-Treg cells) showed significant amelioration of GVHD changes in the liver, lung and intestine in comparison with recipient mice that had received CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells (Treg cells) or naturally occurring CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells.
