Cultured supernatants from activated monocytes plus HBT20-MCAF cells or from activated monocytes plus HBT28-antiMCAF cells inhibited the growth of HBT20 and HBT28 cells, respectively.
To identify the cell type which mediates this effect, CD3+ T-cells, CD56+ cells, and CD14+ monocytes were added to selected CD22+ B-cells.
Increased glutathione biosynthesis by Nrf2 activation in astrocytes prevents p75NTR-dependent motor neuron apoptosis.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages attenuated UCP1 induction and mitochondrial respiration in cultures of primary adipocytes, while the absence of NLRP3 protected UCP1 in adipocytes.
There are two distinct Rac proteins expressed in neurons, namely the ubiquitous Rac1 and the neuron-specific Rac3.
Glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein b (Gpnmb) is a glycosylated transmembrane protein highly expressed in numerous cells, including osteoblasts, dendritic cells and macrophages.
Platelet and megakaryocyte Orai1 transcript levels and membrane protein abundance were significantly reduced in sgk1(-/-) mice.
The DYAR was accompanied by (a) increased expression of CD11b, CD11b/18, CD16,CD32, CD35, CD62E, CD62L, CD64, and CD66b on neutrophils; CD203C on basophils; CD25 and CD62L on eosinophils; CD14, CD16, CD64, and CD86 on monocytes; CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11a, CD18, and CD69 on lymphocytes; CD16, CD56, CD57, and CD94 on natural killer (NK) cells; and CD31, CD41, CD61, CD62P, and CD63 on thrombocytes and (b) decreased expression of CD18 and CD62L on eosinophils, CD15 on neutrophils, and CD40 on lymphocytes.
LIM factor Lhx3 contributes to the specification of motor neuron and interneuron identity through cell-type-specific protein-protein interactions.
Colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) causes the activation of STAT1 and STAT3 transcription factors in bone marrow macrophages (BMM), in the macrophage cell line BAC1.2F5, and in fibroblasts that express the wild-type receptor for CSF-1.
T cell mediated regulation depends on T cell-derived lymphokines such as IL-6, IL-10, GM-CSF and IL-3.
Present in notable volume were fibroblasts, collagen fibers, elastin fibers, adipocytes, and neurovascular structures.
Nestin-expressing hair follicle stem cells that are negative for the keratinocyte marker keratin 15 (K15) can differentiate into neurons, glia, keratinocytes, smooth muscle cells, and melanocytes in vitro.
Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a predominant monocyte chemoattractant secreted by various cells types including mononuclear cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, or keratinocytes.
In all gingival specimens examined, cathepsin G and medullasin were found mainly in neutrophil-like cells and partly in macrophage-like cells.
Monocytes from subjects with high viral load (HVL) had a significant increase in monocytes expressing CD16, CCR5, and MCP-1.
Unstimulated fibroblast cell lines produced IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1.
T-cells, B-cells, nucleated red cells and CD34+/CD19+ early B-cells in bone marrow were Type I, whereas myelomonocytic subset and CD34+/CD33-dim+ common myeloid cells were Type II.
The intermediate filament protein of astrocytes, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) also increases in astrocytes.
Although CD4+ Foxp3+ T cells are largely described in the regulation of CD4+ T cell responses, their role in the suppression of CD8+ T cell priming is much less clear.
