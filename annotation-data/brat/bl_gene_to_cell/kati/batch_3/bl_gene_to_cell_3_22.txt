Monoclonal antibodies to T cells in general (CD2), activated T cells (CD25), B cells (CD22), and macrophages (CD68) were used.
We co-stained CD45, CD14 and CD66b to identify macrophages as CD45+CD14+CD66b- cells.
Consistently, GPR43 expression is reduced in monocytes upon siRNA-knockdown of XBP1, while A549 cells overexpressing XBP1 displayed elevated GPR43 levels.
Transcription factor Egr-1 activates collagen expression in immortalized fibroblasts or fibrosarcoma cells.
For a quick and easy flow cytometric screening of BM samples, we selected six quadruple immunostainings that cover multiple differentiation stages of the B-cell, monocytic, granulocytic, and erythroid lineages: TdT/CD20/CD19/CD10 and CD45/CD34/CD19/CD22 for B cells, CD34/CD117/CD45/CD13.33 for precursor granulocytic and precursor monocytic cells (myelo/monoblasts), CD14/CD33/CD45/CD34 for monocytic cells, CD16/CD13/CD45/CD11b for granulocytic cells, and CD71/CD235a/CD45/CD117 for erythroid cells.
There was a correlation among peripheral insulin resistance, neuronal stress (elevated neuronal corticosterone), and neuronal insulin resistance in HF group.
In organotypic collagen raft co-cultures, in which epithelial cells were grown on top of a collagen gel containing fibroblasts, HCE16/3 cells appeared to be chemotactic to fibroblasts and fibroblasts stimulated the growth of the immortalized epithelial cells.
Patients with complications of SCD showed high expression of alphaMbeta integrin by the neutrophils; and l-selectin by lymphocytes and neutrophils (P < 0.03).
Willin/FRMD6 was first identified in the rat sciatic nerve, which is composed of neurons, Schwann cells, and fibroblasts.
Mast cells release LTB4, IL-5 and IL-8, whereas macrophages release mainly LTB4 and IL-8.
Cultured cells also synthesized the osteoblast-specific marker, osteocalcin.
In contrast, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin did not regulate fibroblast cytokine production, and MBP did not augment fibroblast granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, or type I collagen production, or fibroblast proliferation in this culture system.
Monocytes stimulated with ORM1 were characterized as CD64(-)CD209(-)CD163(+)CCL1(+) cells.
Ets-1 protein was predominantly localized in glomerular epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and interstitial cells.
We investigated the expression of the bone matrix-associated proteins osteonectin and procollagen I and of the bone cell phenotype-related proteins alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin during cell culture in primary human osteoblast like cells.
Infiltrating CD14+ monocytes and expression of CD14 by activated parenchymal microglia/macrophages contribute to the pool of CD14+ cells in ischemic brain lesions.
TNF-? induces CCL4 expression at mRNA and protein levels, in both THP-1 monocytic cells and macrophages (P<0.05).
The addition of beta 2-microglobulin or neopterin values to CD4+ lymphocyte count improved the predictive value of CD4+ lymphocyte count.
TRIM59: A membrane protein expressed on Bacillus Calmette-Gu?rin-activated macrophages that induces apoptosis of fibrosarcoma cells by direct contact.
Alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin levels were elevated in OA osteoblasts compared with normal osteoblasts, whereas osteopontin levels were similar.
