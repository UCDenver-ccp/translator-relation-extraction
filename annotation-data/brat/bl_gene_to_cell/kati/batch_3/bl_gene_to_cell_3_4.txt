Recent advances in action of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), a member of TGF-beta superfamily, in the differentiation process of mesenchymal cells such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, bone marrow stromal cells and muscle cells have been reviewed.
Impaired Ccr2 and Ccl5 expression in athymic microglia/macrophages was restored by T-cell exposure, establishing T-cell-microglia/macrophage interactions as critical stromal determinants that support NF1 LGG growth.
While there were no significant differences between CP and PDAC regarding the distribution of CD3+ T cells and ?-SMA+ fibroblasts, proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly lower and numbers of CD25+(CD4+) and FoxP3+(CD4+) regulatory T cells were greater in PDAC compared with CP.
No RUNX1 and RUNX3 proteins are detected in any of the osteoblastic cells tested.
Normal melanocytes consistently expressed low levels of IL-10 mRNA but did not produce detectable IL-10 protein, nor did keratinocytes or fibroblasts.
Consequently, monocytes were SWC1+ SWC9- and macrophages were SWC1- SWC9+.
PARP-1 expression and activity were increased in granule cell neurons and glia with enhanced ribosylation of proteins, including PARP-1 itself.
NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophage cell lines by prion protein fibrils as the source of IL-1? and neuronal toxicity.
These microparticles were mostly CD31+/CD45- (endothelial), partly CD45+/CD66b+ (granulocyte), and negative for B and T cell markers.
TGF-beta alone has a minimal effect on constitutive ICAM-1 expression in either astrocytes or microglia, but inhibits, in a time-dependent manner, TNF-alpha- or IL-1 beta-induced ICAM-1 mRNA and protein expression in astrocytes.
CD4(+) T cells that express the transcription factor FOXP3 (FOXP3(+) T cells) are commonly regarded as immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs).
Our cell lineage-tracing studies show that Lhx9-expressing cells give rise to both the GAD65 and GAD67 expressing sub-populations of GABAergic amacrine cells.
B cell-B cell interaction through intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and lymphocyte functional antigen-1 regulates immunoglobulin E synthesis by B cells stimulated with interleukin-4 and anti-CD40 antibody.
WILL4 cells were positive for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD21, T-cell receptor (TcR) ??, and TdT, indicating a similar phenotype to thymocytes.
Similarly, PB monocyte-derived macrophages and granulocytes remained negative for CD30 mRNA and protein expression, regardless of stimulation.
Immunocytochemistry revealed expression of BMP-4 and -7 in isolated theca cells whereas granulosa cells and oocytes selectively expressed BMP-6.
Lipoapoptotic supernatants stimulated monocyte migration with the magnitude similar to a monocyte chemoattractant protein, CCL2 (MCP-1).
At the protein level, murine endothelial liver cells expressed AQP1 and AQP9, while hepatocytes expressed AQP3, AQP7, AQP8, and AQP9, and macrophages expressed AQP3.
Fgd1 protein is specifically expressed in cultured osteoblast and osteoblast-like cells including MC3T3-E1 cells and human osteosarcoma cells but not in other mesodermal cells; immunohistochemical studies confirm the presence of Fgd1 protein in mouse calvarial cells.
Remarkably, individual Vn19 cells in dispersed cultures simultaneously expressed marker proteins of neural stem cells (nestin, Bmi1, CD133), neurons (?III tubulin, neurofilament-M) and glial cells (glial fibrillary acidic protein, A2B5, S100?, O4).
