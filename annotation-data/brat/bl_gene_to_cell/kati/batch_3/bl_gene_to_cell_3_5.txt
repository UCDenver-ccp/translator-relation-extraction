We found that osteoclast precursors selectively expressed CX3CR1, whereas CX3CL1 is expressed by osteoblasts.
Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes that kill autologous CD4+ lymphocytes are associated with CD4+ lymphocyte depletion in HIV-1 infection.
Moreover, the expression of both leptin and resistin increased significantly during preadipocyte-adipocyte conversion.
Bam32/DAPP1 and SKAPs function to promote activation of monomeric guanosine triphosphatases, including Rac and Rap, and promote integrin activation, lymphocyte adhesion to matrix proteins, and cell:cell interactions between B and T lymphocytes.
Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived protein with atheroprotective function and the effect of adiponectin on monocyte SOD2 was analyzed herein.
Regarding the morphology, most GluR1-undetectable/GluR2-expressing neurons were pyramidal cells in layers II/III, V, and VI, whereas most GluR1-expressing/GluR2-undetectable neurons were nonpyramidal cells in layers II-VI.
In addition, besides intense BMP2 expression in almost all neurons, we found BMP2 expression in astrocytes and ependymal cells.
Other cytokines, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IFN alpha beta, granulocyte-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, IL-3, TNF-alpha, and TNF-beta were compared to IL-1 for their ability to induce a PMN influx into the peritoneum.
Th2-type cytokine, IL-4 significantly increased, whereas IL-6, CD4+T cells, CD4+/CD8+ ratio and CD3+ T cells decreased.
In the ovary, Cyp17-I, Cyp19a1a and Foxl2a were immunolocalized in both somatic and germ cells while Cyp19a1b was only detected in germ cells and Cyp11c1 in somatic cells.
The expression pattern in leukocytes, however, differed between Phyhd1 and Phyh; Phyhd1 was considerably expressed in T cells and B cells.
IL-4 and IL-13 induce virtually identical transcriptional responses in human monocytes, macrophages, and lung fibroblasts.
STAT-1 mediates the stimulatory effect of IL-10 on CD14 expression in human monocytic cells.
PDAC cells produce IL35 to recruit monocytes via CCL5 and induce macrophage to promote angiogenesis via expression of CXCL1 and CXCL8.
IL-15 was expressed in some fibroblastic reticular cells and gp38(-)CD31(-) double-negative stromal cells in the T-cell zone.
Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that SPINK2 protein is present in male germ cells at all developmental stages, including in testicular spermatogenic cells, testicular sperm, and mature sperm.
Plasticity of Foxp3(+) T cells reflects promiscuous Foxp3 expression in conventional T cells but not reprogramming of regulatory T cells.
Phospho-p38MAPK colocalized with activated microglial cells, but not astrocytes.
We have identified functional EGF receptors (EGFR, ErbB1/HER-1) on peripheral blood monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages.
The V0 neurons represent V0v ventral neurons expressing Pax2.
