AGEs, but not HMGB1, increased monocyte migration via IL-8 and CCL2 from Sw.71 cells.
Thus, Sox9 siRNAs reduced PTGDS expression in WT astrocytes, and Sox9 overexpression rescued PTGDS expression in DJ-1 KO astrocytes.
Fra-1 protooncogene regulates IL-6 expression in macrophages and promotes the generation of M2d macrophages.
Further fractionation of the SVF in CD34+ and CD34- cells indicated that ALOX15a is predominantly expressed in the CD34+ fraction including vascular and progenitor cells, while ALOX15B is mostly expressed in the CD34- cells containing various leucocytes and myeloid cells.
Increased adhesion of CD4+ and CD14+ mononuclear cells to cultured multiple sclerosis brain endothelial cells.
Insulin-induced cytokine production in macrophages causes insulin resistance in hepatocytes.
In cell culture studies, TGF-beta1 significantly inhibited proliferation of MBEC via downregulation of cyclin D1, cdk4, and cdk6, while TGF-beta1 did not influence the proliferation of ICC cells.
Immunohistochemically, no retinal cells expressed beta III tubulin, and Pax6- immunoreactive cells were present in the ciliary non-pigmented epithelial cells.
We have further validated AQP3 and AQP8 protein localization in both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes.
However, in cultures of astrocytes that contained microglia and oligodendrocytes (mixed glia cultures), TGF-beta 1 caused a dose-dependent increase in astrocytic clusterin mRNA levels.
The IL-1 beta precursor (proIL-1 beta) represents a significant component of total IL-1 beta production in certain cell types such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and alveolar macrophages.
In contrast, both hamartin and tuberin demonstrate similar neuronal expression patterns in pure neuronal cultures in vitro.
Interleukin-7 and Toll-like receptor 7 induce synergistic B cell and T cell activation.
In vivo, Cul7 and Fbxw8 were detected in syncytiotrophoblast cells, VT, and EVT cells.
Sphere-forming cells overexpressed stem cell genes Oct?4, Nestin and Pax6.
Expression of Spry4 in cultured cells suppressed integrin-mediated cell spreading, and TESK1 reversed the inhibitory effect of Spry4 on cell spreading.
Sox9 binds to essential sequences in the Col2a1 and collagen alpha2(XI) gene (Col11a2) chondrocyte-specific enhancers and can activate these enhancers in non-chondrocytic cells.
Dental pulp stem cells express mesenchymal cell markers STRO-1, vimentin, CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, CD166, and stem cell markers Sox2, nestin, and nucleostemin.
The CCR2-positive macrophage subtype was different from collagen-internalizing M2-like macrophages.
A significant correlation between transplanted CD34(+) cells versus platelet engraftment and transplanted CD34(+)CD41(+) cells versus leukocyte engraftment was not found.
