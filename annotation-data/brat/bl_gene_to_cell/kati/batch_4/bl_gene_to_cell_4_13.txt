Both cell types are Pax2(+) and vimentin+, whereas astrocytes are GFAP+ and S100beta+, and the precursor cells are A2B5(+).
Moreover, we demonstrate by immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation that WDFY3 interacts with SQSTM1 in macrophages and osteoclasts.
CD34(+)/CD86(+) marrow cells cultured in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-generated macrophages.
MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were localized in tumor cells, stromal fibroblasts and endothelial cells.
Moreover, Th17 cells share major non-lymphoid tissue trafficking receptors, such as CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CXCR3, and CXCR6, with FOXP3+ T regulatory cells.
Correspondingly, both monocytes and VSMCs expressed TNF-R1, and macrophages expressed cell surface TNF-alpha.
Neither granulocyte M-CSF nor IL-3 is produced by cerebellar neurons or neuroblastoma.
Modulation of costimulatory molecules CD80/CD86 on B cells and macrophages by stress proteins GroEL, GroES and DnaK.
Using human circulating leucocytes, we confirmed the presence of FABP4 protein in neutrophils and monocytes.
A basolateral CHIP28/MIP26-related protein (BLIP) in kidney principal cells and gastric parietal cells.
IL-33 localized to CD31(+) endothelial cells, CD90(+) fibroblasts, CD68(+) macrophages and tryptase(+) mast cells, whereas IL-25 was expressed by epithelial cells, mast cells and major basic protein-positive eosinophils.
Syk is expressed in most of hematopoietic cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells.
Astrocyte and Neuronal Pannexin1 Contribute Distinctly to Seizures.
CD44+/CD24- cells and ALDH1+ cells were considered breast cancer stem cells.
In Axin2 -/- chondrocytes, TGF-beta treatment results in a sustained increase in beta-catenin levels compared to wild-type chondrocytes.
Consistently, CCR7 mRNA was detected in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as B cells, but not in NK cells, monocytes or neutrophils, and was dramatically increased in T cells upon treatment with IL-2 or with PHA plus IL-2.
The supernatants of cells derived from all 15 patients did not contain granulocyte-monocyte CSF, monocyte CSF, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, transforming growth factor-beta 1, epidermal growth factor, interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-6.
Unlike cortical projection neurons, postmitotic mitral cell precursors express both Tbr1 and Tbr2.
Matrices produced by smooth muscle cells contained glycoproteins, elastin, and collagens, but matrices of endothelial cells and fibroblasts contained no elastin.
Hematopoietic cells such as macrophages also produce IL-33.
