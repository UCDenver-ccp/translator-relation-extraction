Because Osx null preosteoblasts express typical chondrocyte marker genes, we propose that Runx2/Cbfa1-expressing preosteoblasts are still bipotential cells.
TGFB1 stimulated THBS1 expression in ST2, primary fibroblasts, and the OSCC cells.
We detect cyclin D1 expression in Olig2-immunopositive (Olig2+) oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, as well as in Iba1+ microglia and S100?+ astrocytes in cortices of 3-month-old mice.
Importantly, 3BP2 interacted with Src, Syk, Vav, and Cbl in monocytic cells, and the introduction of constitutively active mutants of Src and NFATc1 in 3BP2-deficient cells restored osteoclast differentiation.
Mechanistically, the platelet-specific receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) mediates these platelet-activating effects.
HOXA9, BMP4, CDKN1A and SMAD2 in fibroblasts, and HOXA7, MCM8, PSMA4 and PSMB2 in keratinocytes were key genes in the PPI networks.
Our findings show that CD14+CD16++ monocytes, a population that is reduced and nonfunctional in SLE patients, have modulatory effects on CD14++CD16- monocytes and T cells.
Fibroblast-like cells were negative for S-100 protein, Leu7, desmin and alpha-SMA.
A murine C-type lectin receptor, dendritic cell immunoreceptor 1 (Dcir1), is expressed on CD11b(+) myeloid cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils.
Differential regulation of interleukin-6, macrophage inflammatory protein-1, and JE/MCP-1 cytokine expression in macrophage cell lines.
MAP-2, GFAP and GalC (which are the specific markers of neural cells, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes respectively), BrdU and beta-tubulin were detected by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent methods.
The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 reduced MMP-1 expression in fibroblasts, as well as ICAM-1 expression in both fibroblasts and adhered monocytes.
Loss of Cdc42 disrupts neuroblast polarity: cdc42 mutant neuroblasts have cytoplasmic Par-6-aPKC, and this phenotype is mimicked by neuroblast-specific expression of a dominant-negative Cdc42 protein or a Par-6 protein that lacks Cdc42-binding ability.
Collectively, the data show that microglia, a primary source of TNF alpha at CNS inflammatory sites, express both TNFR1 and TNFR2, whereas astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, whose embryological origin differs from that of microglia, predominantly express TNFR1.
Although the efficacy of each miRNA to target RUNX2 or TRPS1 differs in osteoblasts and chondrocytes, each effectively blocks maturation of precommitted osteoblasts and chondrocytes.
Chondrocytes from Nacc1(+/+) mice expressed abundant NAC1 while Nacc1(-/-) chondrocytes had undetectable levels.
Furthermore, although CD14 expression decreased on all monocyte subsets, CD16 expression increased on intermediate monocytes only.
Consistently, in Dlx3b/4b- and Sox9a-deficient b380 mutants almost all otic epithelial fates are absent, including sensory hair cells, and the remaining otic cells adopt a neuronal fate.
Several adaptor proteins promote intracellular localisation of the transporter MRP4/ABCC4 in platelets and haematopoietic cells.
Glycoprotein M6B (GPM6B) is a four-transmembrane protein that belongs to the proteolipid protein family and is widely expressed in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes.
