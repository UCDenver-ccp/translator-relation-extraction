Quantitative reduction of peripheral CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+ regulatory T cells in reproductive failure after artificial insemination by donor sperm.
Taken together, the findings indicate the decreased CD4+ T-cell, CD4+/CD8+ T-cell, CD4+CD25+ T-cell, CD3+CD56+ NKT-, and CD3-CD56+CD16+ NK-cell subsets, increased CD8+ T-cell subsets as well as the abnormal expression of NKG2A and NKG2D on CD3+ T and CD3-CD56 + NK cells may play a role in the etiology of SLE.
apoe, abca-1 and abcg-1 proteins in astrocytes.
Finally, at day 6, the cells expressed Nestin, SYNI, SYNIII, ISL-1, homeobox 9 (Hb9) and oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor 2 (Olig2).
NGF, trkA(NGFR) and p75(NTR) were found expressed by fibroblastic-keratocytes.
IQGAP1 is expressed in all cells, while IQGAP2 and IQGAP3 are mainly expressed in hepatic cells.
RIPK1 and RIPK2 were cleaved during HIV-1 infection of T cell lines or primary activated CD4(+) T cells.
Characteristics of astrocyte detachment mediated by myelin basic protein (MBP) specific CD4+ T lymphocytes.
The endothelial cell, tanycyte and ependymal cell expressed GRX mRNA and GRX protein.
Immunoblotting of follicle cell and luteal cell extracts with an anti-PCNA monoclonal antibody revealed PCNA expression in granulosa cells and no detectable PCNA expression in corpora lutea.
According to phenotypic analysis, CD4(+)CD25(-)Foxp3(+) T cells resembled regulatory T cells rather than activated T cells.
In this study, we determined the parameters of specific interaction of LcrV with TLR2 expressed on human transfected HEK293 cells (TLR2+/CD14-), VTEC2.HS cells (TLR2+/CD14-), primary monocytes (TLR2+/CD14+), and THP-1 cells (TLR2+/CD14+).
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine produced by different cell types, including monocytes, lymphocytes, endothelial and mesangial cells.
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a strong mitogen of hepatocytes, and HGF-producing cells have been reported to be Ito cells or endothelial cells in the sinusoid of the liver.
Its receptor CXCR6 is detected on CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, and natural killer T cells.
Double blocking of IL-6 and IL-10 in monocyte/macrophage supernatants abolished this enhancement.
The expression patterns of PTPRZ1 and CSF-1R differed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, macrophages, and intestinal epithelial cell line.
Jak2 vs. Jak3 selectivity as well as "off-target" effects on other cell signaling pathways were measured using a combination of cytokines that target different white blood cell subsets, namely GM-CSF (monocytes/granulocytes), IL-2 (T cells), and CD40L (B cells).
Astrocyte supernatant-mediated protection of ischemic microglia was dependent on TGF-beta1 and NT-3, ischemic astrocytes were protected by GDNF, and ischemic neurons were protected by NT-3.
Mesenchymal stem cells induce the ramification of microglia via the small RhoGTPases Cdc42 and Rac1.
