TLR4, CD14 and MD-2, but not LBP, are expressed in human gingival keratinocytes and fibroblasts.
We also found that in contrast to thoracolumbar preganglionic neurons, the heat shock protein-25 (Hsp25) was not detected in naive sacral preganglionic neurons but was upregulated in many of these neurons after axotomy; the majority of these Hsp25 neurons expressed ATF3.
Reticulocytes and insulin binding to erythrocytes.
Clinical isolation of circulating CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells is usually performed by CD4(+) cell negative selection followed by CD25(+) cell positive selection.
We have investigated the interaction between ICAM-3 and ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins and its role in LFA-1-induced cell-cell interactions and membrane positioning of ICAM-3 in polarized migrating lymphocytes.
Role of platelet amyloid precursor protein.
Indeed, while Jagged2 is expressed in both stromal cells and thymocytes, Jagged1 expression is restricted to stromal cells.
Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed for assessing spinal astrocyte and microglia activation or GPR40/FFAR1 expression.
Elimination of Phox2b, Hand2 and Gata3 in differentiated neurons affects the expression of subtype-specific and/or generic neuronal properties or neuron survival.
Accordingly, hypercholesterolemic mice had increased peripheral blood SDF-1 levels, increased platelets, CXCR4-positive B lymphocytes, neutrophils, and HPCs.
Reducing RFX1 in CD4(+) T cells is sufficient to cause lupus-like T and B cell hyperactivity, whereas overexpressing RFX1 suppresses T cell reactivity.
Osteoblast (Runx2, Osteocalcin) and osteoclast (RANKL, Cathepsin K, TRAP) related genes were analyzed by Immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR.
In HIV-1-infected macrophages, the viral envelope protein induced macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF).
We pathologically evaluated the expressions of astrocytic Cx43/Cx30 and oligodendroglial Cx47/Cx32 relative to those of other astrocytic and oligodendrocyte/myelin markers among the autopsied cases.
NOX2 immunostaining was mainly detected in GABAergic neurons, with a minor presence of NOX2-positive-stained cells in glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurons, as well as astrocytes and microglia.
We also observed that the expression of dentin sialophosphoprotein and dentin matrix protein 1 was induced by TGF-beta3 in primary cultured dental pulp cells, however, not in calvaria osteoblasts, whereas OCN, osteopontin and osteonectin expression was increased after treatment with TGF-beta3 in both dental pulp cells and calvaria osteoblasts.
ProEMAP/p43 and EMAP-II act on many levels and on many cell types including endothelial cells, immune cells and fibroblasts.
Recent evidence suggests that human peripheral blood CD4+CD25+ T cells are heterogeneous and contain both CD4+CD25(high) T cells with potent regulatory activity and many more CD4+CD25(low/med) nonregulatory T cells.
Both T cells and macrophages infiltrated CCR5-deficient hippocampi, showing that CCR5 ligands (including RANTES/CCL5) are not critical to this response.
The present study aimed to define the ability of erythropoietin (EPO) to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells (c-kit(+)/sca-1(+)/lin-1(-); KSL-cells) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34(+) cells), including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 expressing hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34(+)/Flk-1(+) cells).
