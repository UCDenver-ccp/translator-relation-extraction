Foxp3(+)CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells can differentiate from Foxp3(-)CD4(+) medullary thymocytes and Foxp3(-)CD4(+) naive T cells.
These cells consistently express the B-cell-specific transcription factor PAX5, and the B-cell-specific cell surface protein CD19.
While initiating numerous proinflammatory activities in macrophages and neutrophils, GPR84 also possesses GPR109A-like antiatherosclerotic properties in macrophages.
Villi contained activated macrophages, and enterocytes expressed transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta).
The alpha2beta1 integrin, a collagen/laminin receptor, is expressed by a variety of cell types, including epithelial cells, mesenchymal cells, and hematopoietic cells.
Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1, also known as CD91), a multifunctional endocytic and cell signaling receptor, is widely expressed on the surface of multiple cell types such as hepatocytes, fibroblasts, neurons, astrocytes, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and malignant cells.
Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is a cytokine capable of induction of IFNgamma, granulocyte monocyte-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), TNFalpha and IL-1 in immunocompetent cells.
Fusion protein Isl1-Lhx3 specifies motor neuron fate by inducing motor neuron genes and concomitantly suppressing the interneuron programs.
In addition, TLR4 was present on endometrial dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages.
Unlike IL-2, IL-15 is produced by activated monocytes/macrophages.
CD34+CD45- cells are enriched for endothelial cells with robust vasculogenic potential.
The phosphoprotein synapsin I is expressed exclusively in neuronal cells.
They were also distinguishable from glial fibrillary acidic protein+ and glutamine synthetase+ astrocytes and OX-42+ microglia.
This phenotype was reverted upon silencing of MCPIP1 in HepG2 cells and in primary hepatocytes lacking Mcpip1 protein.
Neutrophil release of lactoferrin, plasma lactoferrin concentration, the number of lactoferrin receptor sites on mononuclear cells and granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) release from peripheral blood cells were determined in patients with myeloproliferative disorders and compared with normal individuals.
Mac3+ macrophages, CD4+ T and CD45/B220+ B-cells were identified in both compensated and decompensated hearts.
Intriguingly, numerous CD68(+) microglia/macrophages, nestin(+) neural stem cells, and CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are also present in both the GE stream and the cortical SVZ.
These cell lines show characteristic phenotypes of transformed melanocytes, and express Grm1, and Grm5 (another metabotropic glutamate receptor), as well as melanocyte-specific protein markers.
Regulation of apoptosis in fibroblast-like synoviocytes by the hypoxia-induced Bcl-2 family member Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kd protein-interacting protein 3.
When fibroblasts devoid of Src (SYF cells) and controls (Src(++) cells) were exposed to ouabain, PI3K1A, Akt, and proliferative growth were similarly stimulated in both cell lines.
