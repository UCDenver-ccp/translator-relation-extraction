Synergistic anticancer effects of Pam3CSK4 and Ara-C on B-cell lymphoma cells.
K562-NK cells remarkably expressed the NK cell activation receptors, NKG2D, and DNAM-1.
bcl-2 protein was also induced in glial cells, mainly microglia, border zone of the infarction.
This cell line maintains epithelial cell morphology and expresses cytokeratins K8, K14, K18, K19.
CD4(+)IFN?(-)IL17(-)IL-22(+) T cells (Th22 cells), CD4(+)IFN?(-)IL-22(-)IL17(+) T cells (pure Th17 cells), CD4(+)IL17(+) T cells (Th17 cells), and CD4(+)IFN?(+) T cells (Th1 cells) in RA, osteoarthritis patients, and healthy controls were examined by flow cytometry.
Regulation of Sertoli cell alpha 2-macroglobulin and clusterin (SGP-2) secretion by peritubular myoid cells.
These MDM expressed CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4, the major coreceptors for HIV macrophage- and T cell-tropic isolates, respectively.
CCR6-expressing cells, including CD45RO(+) memory T lymphocytes and fascin(+)-CD1a(+) immature dendritic cells, infiltrated close to the CCL20-expressing epithelial cells.
Our results indicate that Col1a1CreER-DsRed-expressing cells are committed osteoblasts, while Prx1CreER-GFP-expressing cells are osteochondro progenitor cells.
During development, FGFR-1 and FGFR-2 drive oligodendrocytes and motor neuron specification.
Two reports in this issue of Cell Host & Microbe establish that Nod-like receptor proteins NOD1 and NOD2 regulate stem cell function.
In monocytes, NK cells, and T cells, TLR7 was absent.
Likewise, integrin subunits CD11b and CD18 were not detectable on macrophages, while being only slightly reduced on monocytes and granulocytes.
The expression of osteoclastogenic factors produced by PRE-treated osteoblasts such as RANKL, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) was comparable to that of untreated (control) cells.
The expression levels of COL2A1 and COL10A1 genes were higher in cultured chondrocytes than in situ chondrocytes; moreover, the expression of COL1A1 was almost undetectable on cultured chondrocytes; likewise, COL2 and SOX9 proteins were detected by immunofluorescence.
Targeting Neph1 and ZO-1 protein-protein interaction in podocytes prevents podocyte injury and preserves glomerular filtration function.
Macrophages as APC and the dendritic cell myth.
Differential regulation of phagosome maturation in macrophages and dendritic cells mediated by Rho GTPases and ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins.
Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a hemopoietic growth factor that is expressed in activated T cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and endothelial cells.
In the present study, we compared the phenotypic and functional characteristics of monocytes-derived CD14+CD16++ cells with those of macrophages and dendritic cells.
