It was found that, in normal endometrium, the CD45+ cell population comprised T cells, macrophages, CD56+ large granular lymphocytes, some CD16+ cells and a few B cells.
Endothelial progenitor cells: mainly derived from the monocyte/macrophage-containing CD34- mononuclear cell population and only in part from the hematopoietic stem cell-containing CD34+ mononuclear cell population.
CXXC5 regulates differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myocytes.
Transcripts for TRPV2 and TRPV4 were shown in osteoblastic cells.
These neurons expressed the characteristic neuronal markers Tubb3, Syp, Gap43, Hud, Ngn1, Vglut1 (a marker of glutamatergic neurons), and all the glutamate receptor subunits, but not the glial marker Gafp.
C33 Ag was expressed in CD4+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, CD14+ monocytes, and CD16+ granulocytes.
Under these conditions, all aortas showed increased levels of Cx40 in endothelial cells and of both Cx37 and Cx45 in smooth muscle cells.
Neurons and PC12 cells lacking p75NTR display defects in neurotrophin-dependent Akt activation.
In arcuate and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei, Adipor1, and Adipor2 were expressed by neurons and astrocytes.
TLR3-activated RPE cells induced monocyte migration.
Thus, PECAM-1 and gelatinase B are differently regulated in leukocytes and endothelial cells.
ADAP expression with LFA-1 ligation alone was sufficient to polarize T cells directly and to increase T cell motility whereas the loss of ADAP in ADAP-/- primary T cells reduced motility.
Apoptotic cells of an epithelial cell line, AsPC-1, release monocyte chemotactic S19 ribosomal protein dimer.
N-cadherin (CDH2), the neuronal cadherin, stimulates cell-cell contacts during migration and invasion of cells and is able to suppress tumour cell growth.
Notably, only 85.7???5.82% of the CD91(+) monocytes expressed high levels of the classical monocyte marker CD14, with some CD91(+) CD16(+) cells having negligible CD14, indicating that substantial FCM under-counts will occur when monocytes are identified by high CD14.
In expression analyses we show that VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 are preferentially expressed by cultured SVZ-derived doublecortin+ neuroblasts, while VGLUT3 is found on GFAP+ glial cells.
Corticotropin-releasing factor decreases IL-18 in the monocyte-derived dendritic cell.
Eight hours after exposure, before lymphocytes and monocytes had entered the dermal interstitium or epidermis, the keratinocytes expressed TNF-alpha and ICAM-1, whilst the endothelial cells expressed ELAM-1, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1.
Our data provide evidence that p21 regulates the PCNA protein level in adult cardiomyocytes, which has implications for cardiomyocyte growth control.
VPS33B protein expression determined by immunoblotting confirmed the presence of VPS33B in control fibroblasts but not in ARC fibroblasts, and in normal megakaryocytes but not in platelets.
