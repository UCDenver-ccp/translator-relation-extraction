The RT-PCR showed that hAMSCs expressed stem cell marker Nanog and c-MYC, and keratinocyte marker K19, ?1 integrin and K8, whereas hAECs expressed stem cell marker KLF4 and c-MYC, and keratinocyte marker K19, ?1 integrin, K5 and K8.
Glomerular epithelial cells, podocytes, are insulin responsive and can develop insulin resistance.
Elastin, collagen, smooth muscle cells, iron, and inflammatory cells were quantified by immunohistochemistry.
Finally, the data obtained with calbindin-D9k, calbindin-D28k, osteocalcin and VDR, which supports the theory that ameloblasts and odontoblasts are target-cells for 1,25 is presented.
As odontoblasts, pulp cells contributing to the nodule formation express type I collagen, osteonectin, dentin sialophosphoprotein, and nestin.
CDKN1A(p21), BAX and BCL-2 expression in normal fibroblasts and fibroblasts derived from keloids cultured in vitro.
The in vitro differentiated macrophages as well as alveolar macrophages remained responsive to macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), a known transcriptional regulator of monocyte CD36.
PRICKLE3 and PRICKLE4 showed cytoplasmic labeling in ameloblasts and other enamel epithelial cells.
Positioning of reactive IBA1 microglia and GFAP astrocytes at the vasculature was rendered using confocal microscopy.
Brca1-/- fibroblasts are not viable, nor are Brca1-/-:p53-/- fibroblasts.
Relative constitutive expression of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 was similar in neutrophils and monocytes.
Lansoprazole increased HO-1 mRNA levels in endothelial cells and HO-1 protein levels in macrophages.
Expression of NFAT2 increased the expression of IL-4 in both NKT cells and conventional T cells, and NFAT2 activated IL-10 in conventional T cells but not in NKT cells.
Ankyrin-B is a multifunctional adapter protein responsible for targeting select ion channels, transporters, cytoskeletal proteins, and signaling molecules in excitable cells, including neurons, pancreatic ?-cells, and cardiomyocytes.
IP-10 stimulated the expression of RANKL and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) in CD4+ T cells and induced osteoclastogenesis in cocultures of CD4+ T cells and osteoclast precursors.
We aimed to investigate the ability of human primary monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages to express SAA1, SAA2 and SAA4 at both the transcriptional and protein levels, as previous studies almost exclusively dealt with monocytic cell lines.
ATG were shown to bind to CXCR4 and CCR7 on lymphocytes, CXCR4, and CCR5 on monocytes; to down-modulate cell surface expression of CCR7; and to decrease monocyte chemotactic response to CCL5 (RANTES) and lymphocyte chemotactic response to CCL19 (MIP-3beta).
The impact of sIPNs and exogenous KGF upon the latter keratinocyte-fibroblast paracrine relationship and keratinocyte behavior was explored by monitoring keratinocyte adhesion and cytokine (IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, KGF, GM-CSF and TGF-alpha) release.
The enhanced Pitx3, Girk2, Nurr1 and DAT suggested that the increased differentiated neurons were mature A9 DA neurons.
It has been suggested that the neuron specific protein synapsin I is closely related to red blood cell (rbc) protein 4.1.
