Primary pericytes and astrocytes both expressed ceruloplasmin and hephaestin, and RBECs, pericytes, and astrocytes all exhibited ferrous oxidase activity.
BAL determined the total number of macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, epithelial-cells and IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and TGF-beta.
CXCR3 positivity in CD8+ T cells was increased compared to that of CD4+ T cells in the lymph node cells of CIM (CXCR3+ among CD8+ T cell, 65.9???2.1% vs. CXCR3+ among CD4+ T cell, 23.5???4.7%, P <0.001).
We report that expression of constitutively active mutants of Rac or Cdc42 triggered localization of fascin to lamellipodia, filopodia, and cell edges in fibroblasts or myoblasts.
Cases had lower CD4(+) T-cell counts, higher CD8(+) T-cell counts, and increased levels of immune activation (ie, increased soluble CD14 [sCD14] level and increased percentages of CD38(+)HLA-DR(+) cells among both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells), regulatory T cells, and percentage of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)-expressing cells among CD4(+) T cells.
Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) plays an important role in immune responses, especially in T cell/endothelial cell and T cell/macrophage interactions.
Cardiac resident macrophages, infiltrating leukocytes, and cardiomyocytes themselves produce TNF-alpha.
Taken together, our results demonstrate that NHE-1 protein was abundantly expressed in activated microglia and astrocytes.
GPR84 is expressed in leukocytes and monocyte/macrophage.
Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulates proliferation and improves functions of neutrophils and monocyte/macrophages.
CXCL12 stimulated transmigration of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, CD19(+) B cells, and CD14(+) monocytes.
Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), hitherto identified on activated B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, endothelia and certain epithelial cells, serves as a ligand for the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1).
Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressed granulysin.
After exposure to MWNTs, CNT were uptaken more effectively by CD11b/c positive cells (microglia), compared to GFAP positive cells (astrocytes).
These common features include CDC14B-dependent activation of APC-CDH1 in prophase I arrested oocytes or G2-arrested somatic cells, and CDC25B-dependent cell cycle resumption in both oocytes and somatic cells.
Snake venom C-type lectin proteins (snaclecs) have diverse targets, including platelet GPVI, GPIb, integrin ?2?1 or CLEC-2 expressed in platelets, endothelial cells or myeloid cells.
Cathepsin B and L are involved in degradation of prions in GT1-1 neuronal cells.
BrdU(+) insulin(-) PDX-1(+) cells, Ngn3(+) cells and insulin(+) glucagon(+) cells, which showed stem cells, were also found during beta-cell regeneration.
Total cell number and RA of OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, DNMT1, IGF2, IGF2R, MNSOD, GLUT1, BAX and BCL2 in cloned blastocysts derived from BCB+ oocytes with ETC more closely followed that of IVF counterparts compared to BCB+ oocytes with extract untreated cell and BCB- oocytes with ETC derived blastocysts.
Infiltrating macrophages and resident fibroblasts expressed Smad3, the positive mediator for transforming growth factor-beta responses.
