CCR2 and CCR5 monocyte expression remained unchanged; however, CCR5 levels on CD4 and CD8 T cells and CCR2 expression on CD4 T cells increased (P's < 0.01).
Enhanced production of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) and chemokines (CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5) correlated with migration of NK cells, macrophages, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) into the lungs.
Toll-like receptor 4 was localized on CD4+ lymphocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells, whereas lymphocytes and eosinophils, but not mast cells, expressed TLR-9.
The histiocytic cells were CD68-positive; and CD21 and CD35-positive follicular dendritic cell meshworks were absent.
Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR revealed that SLIT2, SLIT3, ROBO1, and ROBO2 are expressed in luteal steroidogenic cells and fibroblast-like cells of the human CL.
T cells, macrophages and neutrophils, and repressed the expression of immune cells related chemokines (CXCL10, CCL20, CCL2 and CXCL2) in mouse lesions.
Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3) belong to the CXC and CC chemokine families, and mediate the chemotaxis of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages respectively.
As demonstrated here, PDAC (Panc1, T3M4) cells or premalignant H6c7 pancreatic ductal epithelial cells differentially express ?Zip2- and ATF3, relating to stronger Nrf2 activity seen in Panc1 cells and TGF-?1 activity in T3M4 or H6c7 cells, respectively.
HOXB3 mRNA levels are high in the earliest CD34+ lineage- bone marrow cells and low to undetectable in later CD34+/CD34- cells.
Double-labeled immunofluorescence further revealed that TRPV1 was localized on NeuN-positive neurons and GFAP-positive astrocytes, but not on HLA-positive microglia.
Clinical characteristics, expression of CD8, CD3, FOXP3, CD20, CD68/CD163 (tumor associated macrophage, TAM), Tia-1 (cytotoxic T cell), CD303 (plasmacytoid dendritic cells: pDC), Arginase-1 (myeloid derived suppressor cells: MDSC), PD-1 on immune-cells (IC), and PD-L1 on tumoral cells (TC) and IC were analysed and correlated with outcome.
In this study, we demonstrate that CLEC-1 is expressed by myeloid cells and specifically by endothelial cells in tolerated allografts and that CLEC-1 expression can be induced in endothelial cells by alloantigen-specific regulatory CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells.
We have investigated the differentiation abilities of gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma), interleukin-6 (IL-6), macrophage and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (M-CSF + GM-CSF) or the combinations IL-6 + M-CSF + GM-CSF and IFN-gamma + M-CSF + GM-CSF on the U937 cells by studying the morphology, cytochemical activity and several functional properties.
Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) is expressed in both adipocytes and macrophages.
CD4+/UCHL1+T cells are thought to be prestimulated or primed helper T cells involved in memory T cell function.
Collagen fibrils were numerous and macrophages (CD68) and fibroblasts (vimentin) were increased.
The saturable insulin binding is linked to insulin degradation in two important target cells: The hepatocyte and the adipocyte.
Relationship between beta-amyloid precursor protein, pyramidal neurones and astrocytes in human neocortex.
IGFBP5 protein is detected in vivo in osteoblasts, BM stromal cells, and endothelial cells.
This study revealed that COX-1 and COX-2 protein expression were significantly increased in vascular endothelial, smooth muscle cells, and CD68+ microglia/macrophages following TBI.
