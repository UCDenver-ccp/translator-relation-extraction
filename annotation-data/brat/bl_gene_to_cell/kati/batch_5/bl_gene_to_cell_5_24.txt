Formation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in osteoblasts and bone marrow stromal cells is believed to regulate osteoclast recruitment.
Primary cultures contained Prox1-positive hepatoblasts, Desmin/SMA-positive myofibroblasts and only a few Desmin-positive/SMA-negative cells.
Moreover, blockade of the platelet adhesion molecules P-selectin, GPIIb/IIIa, and CD40L attenuated platelet-dependent lymphocyte deposition.
TAK1 was mainly localized to cardiomyocytes, whereas TGF-beta1 receptors were observed in vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts as well as cardiomyocytes.
CD31 (PECAM-1) expressed at endothelial cell junctions is ligated by leukocytes during transendothelial migration.
Most BrdU labeled cells also expressed PS-1 at a time when few BrdU labeled cells expressed the early neuronal markers beta-III tubulin or TOAD-64 and none expressed mature neuronal (NeuN or calbindin) or astrocytic (GFAP) markers.
Indeed, AEBP1-overexpressing transgenic macrophages exhibit diminished cholesterol efflux compared with AEBP1 nontransgenic macrophages, whereas AEBP1-knockout (AEBP1-/-) macrophages exhibit enhanced cholesterol efflux compared with wild-type (AEBP1+/+) macrophages.
RT-PCR, real-time PCR, and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed that the expression of PTN by monocytic cells led to a downregulation of CD68, c-fms, and CD14 monocytic cell markers and an upregulation of FLK-1, Tie-2, vascular endothelial-cadherin, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, endothelial NO synthase, von Willebrand factor, CD34, GATA-2, and GATA-3 endothelial cell markers.
Double immunolabeling revealed LILRA2 expression on CD14+, CD68+ monocytes/macrophages.
Eps8 involvement in neuregulin1-ErbB4 mediated migration in the neuronal progenitor cell line ST14A.
The Eotaxin gene family (Eotaxin1, Eotaxin2 and Eotaxin3) recruits and activates CCR3-bearing cells such as eosinophils, mast cells and Th2 lymphocytes that play a major role in allergic disorders.
Furthermore, single-cell reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, TRPC5, TRPC6, and TRPC7 subunits were expressed in GnRH neurons.
CD11a, CD11b, CD18, and CD35 was studied by flow cytometry on neutrophils and monocytes.
Ang II also activated macrophages and colonic fibroblasts.
Immunocytochemically, osteonectin could be demonstrated in active osteoblasts and osteoprogenitor cells as well as in young osteocytes, while aged, quiescent osteocytes did not contain the protein, suggesting that the protein is a marker of the osteoblastic functional differentiation of bone cells.
Cell-surface expression of CD14 and CD16 defines three functionally and phenotypically distinct subsets of monocytes: classical (CD14(++)CD16(-)) monocytes, intermediate (CD14(++)CD16(+)) monocytes, and nonclassical (CD14(+)CD16(++)) monocytes.
The immunologic parameters studied included T-lymphocytes and monocytes as well as interleucin (IL)-1 and IL-6 synthesis by monocytes, and IL-2 and IL-6 synthesis by T-lymphocytes.
Bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of the IkappaB protein MAIL in B-lymphocytes and macrophages.
Native CD45-/CD34+/CD31- cells have been previously described as human adipocyte progenitors.
GIT1 and GIT2 control numerous cellular functions and are highly expressed in neurons, endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells.
