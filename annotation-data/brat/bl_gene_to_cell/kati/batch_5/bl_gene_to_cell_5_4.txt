Granulysin is a cytolytic granule protein released by natural killer cells and activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes.
The T cell-derived cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 are able to block further T lymphocyte chemotaxis, thus leading to a focusing of T lymphocytes in an area of T lymphocyte activation.
We did not detect the JAK2(V617F) mutation in the CD20+/CD5+ B cells but detected it in CD20+/CD5- B cells, T and NK cells, indicating a lymphoid subdifferentiation of the JAK2(V617F) MPN clonality.
Pax6-transduced HeLa cells expressed high levels of neuronal alpha3 tubulin, demonstrating a partial transdifferentiation towards a neuronal phenotype.
Macrophages produce TGF-beta-induced (beta-ig-h3) following ingestion of apoptotic cells and regulate MMP14 levels and collagen turnover in fibroblasts.
Immunocytochemistry of lavage cells for IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 protein showed alveolar macrophages to contain all three cytokines, with lesser staining evident in neutrophils, and in epithelial cells occasionally obtained by lavage.
Both neurons and astrocytes expressed BDNF, but not microglia.
This suggests that many spleen cells produce substantial amounts of IL-2 but little or no IL-4, IL-5, IFN-gamma, IL-3, and granulocyte/macrophage-CSF.
We used immunohistochemical methods to visualize activated microglia, interleukin-1b (IL-1b)-, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-expressing cells.
Neuronal TIMP-1 release accompanies astrocytic MMP-9 secretion and enhances astrocyte proliferation induced by beta-amyloid 25-35 fragment.
T cells (CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+?cells), CD4+?CD25+?Tregs, and CD16+?CD56+?NK cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.
Notably, ALDH1-positive cells are enriched in the side-population (SP) cells, and stem cells-like genes OCT4, BMI1, KLF4 and SOX2 are preferentially expressed in ALDH1-positive cells.
Nor was there detectable regulation of IL-1 beta, IL-3, IL-11, IL-4 or granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor by T3 in any cell type.
Calcification was significantly suppressed in cultures of Akt1(-/-) chondrocytes or ATDC5 cells overexpressing siRNA for Akt1 and was enhanced in ATDC5 cells overexpressing constitutively active Akt1.
Jak2/STAT3 activity was localized primarily in these myeloid cells, which prevented the differentiation of immature myeloid cells into mature dendritic cells.
The platelet 90-kDa protein is immunologically related to rabbit macrophage gelsolin.
TIMP-2 expression was identified in fibroblasts, macrophages and epithelial cells.
Postmortem brain studies of BD patients to assess glial cells, such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and their markers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Olig1 and Olig2, produced controversial results.
AFS cells were positive for the undifferentiated cell markers, Oct4, Nanog, Sox2 and Hes1, while following differentiation cells expressed markers for neurogenic cells such as astrocyte [GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein)] and NSE (neuron-specific enolase), adipogenic cells [LPL+ (lipoprotein lipase+)], osteogenic cells (osteocalcin+ and osteonectin+) and endothelium [CD34+ and eNOS+ (endothelial nitric oxide synthase)].
HMGB1 protein was predominantly detected in inflammatory cells and hyperplasic epithelial cells in IPF.
