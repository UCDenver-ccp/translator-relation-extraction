The trafficking kinetics of Glut4, the transferrin (Tf) receptor, and LRP1 were quantified in adipocytes and undifferentiated fibroblasts.
Myd88(-/-) Kupffer cells, but not Trif(-/-) cells, exhibited normal caspase-1 activation upon TLR4 engagement in vitro.
IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-3, colony stimulating factor (CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF) caused significant histamine release from cells from a similar number of AIDS patients and controls.
Embryonic bone morphogenetic protein and nodal induce invasion in melanocytes and melanoma cells.
Second, the viruses replicated actively during the maturation of CD34+ stem cells toward CD1a+ DC and CD1a- CD14+ cells.
Tubular M-CSF staining was strongest in areas of tubular damage and co-localized with KP1+ macrophages, including KP1+PCNA+ proliferating macrophages.
The VE-induced increase in the percentage of CD4+CD8- thymocytes was due to an increase in the TCR2+CD4+CD8- thymocyte subset, whereas the decrease in the percentage of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes involved all TCR defined T cell subsets.
The proportion of CD4+ lymphocytes that expressed TNF alpha was significantly increased while the number CD14+ cells staining for TNF alpha was unchanged.
Dendritic cells regulate T-cell deattachment through the integrin-interacting protein CYTIP.
The monocyte/macrophage CD69 expression rate was significantly negatively correlated with the absolute value of CD4(+) T cells (r = -0.872,
Astrocytes express glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), whereas different neuron types contain neurofilament proteins, ?-internexin, or peripherin.
CTGF was highly expressed in preadipocytes, not adipocytes.
In the remaining cases TAL1 expression was restricted to a minor population (< 5%) of larger, strongly TAL1-positive cells which comprised erythroid cells, CD34+ CD3- precursors and an unidentified TAL1+ CD45- population which morphologically resembled monocytes/macrophages.
Nkx2.5/GATA4 expression in a subpopulation of resident neural stem cells provides the appropriate phenotype for their potential differentiation to a nestin+ cardiac myocyte-like cell.
Adipocyte SIRT1 controls systemic insulin sensitivity by modulating macrophages in adipose tissue.
To determine whether activation of caspase 3 is sufficient to induce apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, an engineered TAT-caspase 3 protein was introduced to cardiomyocytes.
IL-10 induced Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in the human CD4(+) T cell population.
Four discrete CD4 T-cell subsets were assessed by?flow cytometry: T(H)1/(TH)17 cells (CXCR3(+)CCR6(+)CCR4(-)), (TH)1 cells (CXCR3(+)CCR6(-)CCR4(-)), (TH)17 cells (CXCR3(-)CCR6(+)CCR4(+)), and (TH)2 cells (CXCR3(-)CCR6(-)CCR4(+)).
The enforced expression of OLIG2 in neuroepithelial cells inhibits the LIF-induced astrocytic differentiation.
Neurogenic cells only express NSE (early neuronal progenitor marker), but not GFAP, Tau, MAP2 (mature neuron and glial markers); myogenic cells are positive for MyoD1 and Myosin heavy chain.
