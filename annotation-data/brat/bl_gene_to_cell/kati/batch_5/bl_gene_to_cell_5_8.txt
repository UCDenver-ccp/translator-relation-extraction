Levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 were increased postoperatively, correlating with a reduction of CCR2 expression and an increase of CD11b expression on monocytes, suggesting monocyte activation by MCP-1.
CD34+CD13bright, CD34+CD14+, and CD34+CD15+ cells generated myeloid progeny, and CD34+CD20+ cells failed to differentiate along the T lymphoid and myeloid lineages.
Fluorescent double-labeling for M35 and GFAP, an astrocytic microfilament protein, revealed that all M35-positive glial cells express GFAP and, conversely, that almost all GFAP glial cells were M35-immunostained.
Specifically, fibroblasts close to neuromuscular junctions expressed the lacZ-protein, whereas skeletal muscle fibroblasts far from synaptic sites and fibroblasts in other organs were lacZ-negative.
Following growth arrest, the cells display a neuron-like morphology and express tau and synaptophysin, two proteins synthesized in differentiating neurons.
To examine roles of microglia, we ablate microglia by microglia-selective deletion of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (Csf1r) by crossing floxed-Csf1r and Iba1-iCre mice (Csf1r-cKO).
ciPSCs demonstrated stem cell morphology and expressed key stem cell markers, including alkaline phosphatase, POU5F1, SOX2, NANOG, and SSEA-1.
The dominant chemokines in preadipocytes were CCL5, CCL8, CXCL1, and CXCL16, and in adipocytes CCL6 and CXCL13.
In sensitised gliadin-fed animals, CD4+, CD4+/Foxp3+ and CD8+ T cells increased, whereas the administration of B. longum CECT 7347 reduced CD4+ and CD4+/Foxp3+ cell populations and increased CD8+ T cell populations.
3T3L1 pre-adipocytes and differentiated adipocytes expressed both CRF1 and CRF2 receptors and UCN3, while UCN2 was detected only in differentiated adipocytes.
Four B cell subsets repopulated the PB: plasmablasts (CD19+, CD5-,IgD-,CD38++), transitional type 1 (T1) B cells (CD19+,CD5+,IgD+,CD38++), mature Bm2 cells (CD19+,CD5+/-,IgD+,CD38+/-), and memory B cells (CD19+,CD5-,IgD-,CD38-). Increased numbers of Bm2 cells and decreased memory B cells reappeared with time.
Anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, was negligible in hepatocytes and detected principally in infiltrating lymphocytes.
fibroblasts or endothelial cells expressed beta 1, alpha 2, or alpha 6 integrins.
In the LH, orexin neurons excite GAD65-expressing neurons.
Transferrin-reticulocyte cycle time in rat reticulocytes.
Neuronal damage and GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes were also observed.
NRP1 potentiates the signaling pathways stimulated by semaphorin 3A and VEGF-A in neuronal and endothelial cells, respectively.
Apolipoprotein A-I stimulates secretion of apolipoprotein E by foam cell macrophages.
NAP-2 and lymphotactin selectively attract granulocytes, respectively, lymphocytes.
Heating increased the expression of p53 protein and p21 protein markedly in RKO.C cells and slightly in RC10.1 cells.
