Our data support a lineage relationship in which TRPM8- and TRPA1-expressing sensory neurons derive from the population of TRPV1-expressing neurons.
Cbfa1 does not regulate RANKL gene activity in stromal/osteoblastic cells.
Leukocyte elastase, cationic proteins in neutrophils, activities of alpha 1-proteinase and alpha 2-macroglobulin were determined in patients' plasma.
GDF9 and BMP15 are expressed specifically in mammalian oocytes and also participate in cumulus-oocyte crosstalk.
We also determined in separate experiments endothelial cell and myocyte apoptosis by caspase-3 and Annexin V.
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) has hemopoietin-1 (H-1) activity, i.e., it synergizes with macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3) in stimulating in vitro colony formation of hematopoietic progenitor cells.
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a pluripotent secreted protein that stimulates a wide array of cellular targets, including hepatocytes and other epithelial cells, melanocytes, endothelial and haematopoietic cells.
Exogenous treatment of astrocytes with Meteorin protein also promotes astrocyte expression and secretion of TSP-1/-2.
The growth factors erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and hepatocyte growth factor were added as indicated.
The erythrocyte membrane protein of band 4.1 is an essential protein of the erythrocyte cytoskeleton.
Biopsies with CAN revealed a lower expression of MCP-1, RANTES, CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 in tubulointerstitial cells, and a significantly lower infiltration with MRP14-positive monocytes/macrophages than biopsies with AR.
Endothelin-1 secreted from keratinocytes stimulates fibroblast-embedded collagen gel contraction in vitro.
CP5 and CP8 trigger KB cells to produce interleukin-8 (IL-8); endothelial cells to produce IL-8 and IL-6; and monocytes to produce IL-8, IL-6, IL-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha.
The expression of surface markers CD16, CD24, CD69 and CD14 on granulocytes and monocytes was quantified by flow cytometry analysis.
However, a very small numbers of the cells expressed GFAP, a marker for astrocytes, O4, a marker for immature oligodendrocytes, and betaIII-tubulin, a marker for neurons.
The recruitment of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages via chemokine receptor CCR2 as well as of lymphocytes and hepatic stellate cells via CCR5 promote the progression of NASH to fibrosis.
Morphological development was monitored by phase-contrast microscopy and by immunofluorescent staining of markers specific for neurons (NSE, MAP2, B-50, and the 200 kD neurofilament protein), astrocytes (GFAP), oligodendrocytes (galactocerebroside), macrophages (ED-1) and fibroblasts (fibronectin).
Mbd3l2 expression is restricted to metaphase II oocytes and zygotes making both proteins candidates for the zygotic demethylation process.
Platelets, thrombospondin-1 and human dermal fibroblasts cooperate for stimulation of endothelial cell tubulogenesis through VEGF and PAI-1 regulation.
Sclerostin-positive cells were identified as osteoclasts.
