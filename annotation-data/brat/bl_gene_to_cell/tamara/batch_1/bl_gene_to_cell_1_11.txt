We conclude that 1) IL-4 augments epithelial cell ICAM-1 expression, 2) IL-4 potentiates the adhesion of THP-1 monocyte/macrophage cells to epithelial cells, and 3) modulation of epithelial cell ICAM-1 expression by IL-4 may play a role in the immunopathology of bronchial asthma.
Mesenchymal stem cells generate a CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cell population during the differentiation process of Th1 and Th17 cells.
CD4+/CCR4+ synovial lymphocytes produced more IL-4 and less IFN-gamma than CD4+/CCR4(-) cells.
Grancalcin is a protein specifically expressed in neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for CD56, CD68, CD117 and CD1a was performed to detect natural killer cells, macrophages, mast cells and Langerhans cells, respectively.
TLR1, 2 and 4 expression occurred on monocytes and neutrophils, with monocytes expressing higher baseline levels of TLR2.
Our data indicate that hepatocytes express CD14 and that hepatocyte CD14 mRNA and protein levels increase rapidly during endotoxemia.
Lymphocytes constitutively produce GM-CSF and IL-3 and, to a lesser degree, IL-1, IL-4 and LIF whilst histiocytes produce TNF alpha, IL-1 beta and GM-CSF.
There were similar levels of CD30 expression in naive T cells, CD4(+) T cells, and regulatory (CD4(+)CD127(low)CD25(+)) T cells.
Immature neuroblasts and maturing polar neurons also showed immunoreactivity with TUJ1, whereas reactivity for microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), tau, the 200 kilodalton isoform of neurofilament protein, neuron-specific enolase and synaptophysin was primarily seen in maturing neurons.
CCL2 and interleukin-6 promote survival of human CD11b+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells and induce M2-type macrophage polarization.
G3139 downregulated Bcl-2 protein levels in peripheral blood circulating myeloma cells, B cells, T cells, and monocytes.
NeuN, GFAP, IBA1 and NG2 were used as cell type-specific markers to neurons, astrocytes, microglia and NG2 glia, respectively.
MMP12 production by monocyte-derived cells was induced by CSF2 rather than the cyclooxygenase-2 pathway, and treatment of monocyte-derived cells with a CD200R ligand reduced CSF2-induced MMP12 production.
In addition, Ang1 expression in osteoblasts showed higher correlation with expression of connexin43, the major marker of cell-cell interactions, whereas Ang2 related to integrin beta1, the major marker of cell-matrix interactions.
We were able to identify six subsets of CPCs: pluripotent stem cells (CD14 (+), CD45 (+), and CD34 (+)), monocyte-derived multipotential cells (MOMCs) or monocyte-derived mesenchymal progenitors (CD14 (+), CD45 (+), CD34 (+), Col I (+), CD11b (+), CD68 (+), CD105 (+), and VEGFR1 (+)), early endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) or monocytic pro-angiogenic hematopoietic cells or circulating hematopoietic cells (CD14 (+), CD45 (+), CD34 (low/-), VEGFR2 (+/-), CXCR4 (+), c-kit (+), and DC117 (+)), late EPCs (CD14 (-), CD133 (+), VEGFR2 (+), CD144 (+) [VE-cadherin (+)], and CD146 (+)), fibroblast-like cells (FLCs)/circulating Col-producing monocytes (CD14 (+), CD45 (+), CD34 (+/-), and Col I (+)), and fibrocytes (CD14 (-), CD45 (+), CD34 (+), Col I (+), and CXCR4 (+)).
The GPIIIa-like protein in human endothelial and smooth muscle cells had the same isoelectric point as platelet GPIIIa, whereas their GPIIb alpha-like protein was slightly more acidic than platelet GPIIb alpha (pI = 5.2-5.3
Follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) is a glycoprotein secreted by skeletal muscle cells and cardiac myocytes.
Th1 cells produce IL-2 and IFN-gamma that mediate cell-mediated immunity, and Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 that mediate humoral immunity.
Immunolocalization of TIP39 and tuftelin in cultured ameloblast-like cells showed that these two proteins colocalize.
