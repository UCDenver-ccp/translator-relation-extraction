Several osteoclast-activating factors, such as interleukin-1, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-6, are involved in this process.
The cytosolic adhesion- and degranulation-promoting adaptor protein (ADAP) is expressed in T cells, natural killer cells, myeloid cells, and platelets.
Nestin, a neural stem cell marker protein, is expressed in hair follicle cells above the bulge area.
Cx43 function has been studied in astrocyte cultures of Cx43-deficient mice, which lack Cx43 in all cell types.
Effects of interleukin-10 on monocyte/endothelial cell adhesion and MMP-9/TIMP-1 secretion.
Preosteoblasts, osteoblasts and osteocytes co-expressed PTHrP and PTH1R.
SMN, Gemin2 and Gemin3 associate with beta-actin mRNA in the cytoplasm of neuronal cells in vitro.
We examined the spontaneous production of interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) by peripheral-blood B lymphocytes, T cells, CD8(-) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, CD3(-) CD16/56(+) lymphocytes (natural killer [NK] cells), CD3(+) CD16/56(+) lymphocytes (natural T [NT] cells), and/or monocytes of 316 acutely ill hospitalized persons and 62 healthy adults in Malawi, Africa.
However, interleukin-3, interleukin-11, granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, and thrombopoietin were not measurable.
The sections were double immunostained for mast cell tryptase and chymase, mast cell tryptase and ki-67, mast cell tryptase and chemokines (i.e., CCL2, CCL5, CCL11, TGFbeta), as well as tryptase and CCR3.
Taking together, we propose that rBNPI/p58 functions as a GT1b-binding protein in neuronal cells.
CD14+ monocytes were the major cell type generated from CD34+lin-Flt3high cells in liquid suspension culture, whereas cells generated from CD34+lin-Flt3low cells were mainly CD71+GlycA+ erythroid cells.
Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and sorted from species mixtures defined as CD34+ lineage negative progenitor cells, CD14+CD16+ monocyte-macrophages and central, stem cell and effector memory T cells.
Interleukin-9 (IL-9) stimulates the proliferation of mast cells and lymphocytes.
Macrophage colony-stimulating factor promotes cell survival through Akt/protein kinase B.
Monocytes and macrophages have receptors for the iron-binding protein lactoferrin.
We determined the counts or percentages of whole-blood cells exhibiting the following characteristics: FOXP3(+) cells among CD4(+) Treg cells; CTLA-4(+) cells among CD4(+)/CD25(+) Treg cells; and CD27(+), CD80(+), CD86(+), or CD95(+) cells among CD19(+) B cells.
COPs expressed the stem cell markers nestin, Notch1, Musashi-1, and ABCG2 and showed the side population cell phenotype.
Most SNAT1+ cells were pyramidal neurons, but numerous non-pyramidal neurons were also observed: SNAT1/GABA double-labeling studies showed that SNAT1 is expressed in all GABA+ neurons.
The IRE-1/XBP-1 pathway is required for development of highly secretory cells, particularly plasma cells and hepatocytes.
