He had a CD10 and BCL2-positive, BCL6-negative B-cell malignancy with loss of multiple B-cell markers including surface immunoglobulin.
Stem-Cell-Derived Astrocytes Divulge Secrets of Mutant GFAP.
Cells of ICCs showed increased insulin protein expression, glucose-dependent insulin release, and coexpression of insulin and C-peptide.
In the mantle zone, R-cadherin-expressing neuroblasts accumulate in parallel with neuroblasts expressing another cadherin, N-cadherin.
The cells co-express TrkA and NGF and the role for NGF is to maintain the TrkA-expressing horizontal cells.
IL-10 is produced by CD4+, Tho, Th1, B lymphocytes, mast cells, eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages and keratinocytes.
Consistently, various TLR3-deficient leukocytes from the patient, including CD14(+) and/or CD16(+) monocytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and in vitro derived monocyte-derived macrophages, responded normally to both poly(I:C) and HSV-1, with the induction of antiviral IFN production.
CXCL9-expressing macrophages/Kupffer cells were colocalized with infiltrating T cells, and in vivo administration of anti-CXCL9 suppressed AIH progression.
Immunohistochemical techniques were adopted to detect the cells that express nestin, neurofilament proteins (NF)-200 and glial fibrillary acidic proteins (GFAP), the markers of neural stem cells, neurons, astrocytes respectively.
The percentage of CSF3R(+) melanocytes was higher than CSF3R(+) HEL 92.1.7 cells, but was lower than CSF3R(+) neutrophils.
Inhibition of p38 MAPK decreased dose-dependently the mast cell generated TNF-alpha production as well as TNF-alpha-induced expression of P-selectin and neutrophil adhesion on endothelial cells.
In vitro analysis showed that galectin-4 is effectively endocytosed by macrophages, and may scavenge galectin-4 from oligodendrocytes, and that endogenous galectin-4 levels are increased in alternatively interleukin-4-activated macrophages and microglia.
The soluble CD14 protein and mRNA expression was detected in microglia cells, indicating that microglia may be a cellular source of soluble CD14 in CSF.
Cx47-ablation completely abolished coupling of oligodendrocytes to astrocytes.
CXCL5 and CXCL8 were mainly produced by epithelial cells, whereas CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL3 had a high expression in blood cells.
Stat1 regulates CD36 expression and foam cell formation in macrophages in vitro; the Stat1 regulation of foam cell formation requires CD36.
Although neurofibromas contain numerous S100 protein/SOX10-positive Schwann cells and CD34-positive fibroblasts, both components are reduced or absent in MPNST.
significantly reduced the protein level of Robo2 in HEK293 cells, and overexpression of Robo3.1A also significantly decreased Robo2 protein level in cerebellar granule cells.
Monocytes/macrophages are important targets of HIV-1 infection, and previous work has shown that cyclin T1 but not Cdk9 protein expression is low in monocytes isolated from blood.
Both myotubes and muscle fibers also expressed low levels of alpha2/delta-2 and alpha2/delta-3 mRNA at all ages.
