Loss of p53 in stromal fibroblasts promotes epithelial cell invasion through redox-mediated ICAM1 signal.
Although it appears that Lhx1 and Lhx5 do not control the initial specification of the neuronal cell types in which they are expressed, we have found a cell-autonomous requirement for either Lhx1 or Lhx5 to maintain the expression of Pax2, Pax5 and Pax8 in dorsal inhibitory neurons at later developmental stages.
Previously, we reported a unique CD14+CD45+CD34+type I collagen+ cell fraction derived from human circulating CD14+ monocytes, named monocyte-derived mesenchymal progenitors (MOMPs).
50B11 cells express neuronal cytoplasmic proteins including beta-3 tubulin, peripherin (a marker of unmyelinated neurons), and the pan-neuronal ubiquitin hydrolase, PGP9.5.
breakdown of collagen by fibroblasts and osteoclasts].
Acat2 [gene name: sterol O-acyltransferase 2 (SOAT2)] esterifies cholesterol in enterocytes and hepatocytes.
HLA null cells and evaluating the frequency of KIR3DS1+/-KIR2DL5+/-, KIR3DS1+/-KIR2DS1+/-, KIR3DS1+/-KIR2DS5+/- NK cells secreting IFN-? and/or expressing CD107a.
Precursors (CD34+), early and late myeloid cells (CD33+/CD34+, CD33+/CD34-) as well as lymphocytes of the B-cell lineage (CD19+/CD10+, CD19+/CD10-) expressed the MDR1 gene.
In the HGF group, Bcl-2 protein was obviously represented in survival neurons as well as in vascular endothelial cells and in glial cells subjected to ischemia.
We investigated the effects of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 modulation of osteoblastic cells under microgravity conditions.
CD31(+) endothelial cells co-expressed the fibroblast/myofibroblast markers fibroblast-specific protein-1 (FSP-1) and ?-SMA, indicative for the occurrence of endoMT.
Using ELISA and RIA, we studied, in the supernatant of cells from CDCL, the time course of interleukins 3 and 6 (IL-3, IL-6), stem cell factor (SCF), granulocyte-macrophage, granulocyte and macrophage colony stimulating factors (GM-CSF, G-CSF and M-CSF), macrophage-inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF beta1).
Lysates of PAI-1 +/+ platelets inhibited human tPA, whereas PAI-1 -/- platelet lysates did not.
4. Three of these MAbs are described: AGC5, AGC7, and AGC13 which recognise respectively germinal epithelial cells, supporting cells and germ cells.
-treated NRSF deficient astrocytes compared to WT astrocytes.
In contrast, GC-induced expression of the regulatory protein GILZ was significantly reduced in ANXA1(-/-) cells by silencing of ANXA1 in WT cells and in macrophages of ANXA1(-/-) mice in vivo.
PLC-?3 regulates the expression of periostin in fibroblasts and TSLP in keratinocytes, two proteins critically involved in AD pathogenesis.
In MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cell line TGF beta1 inhibited the expression of the Runx2 and osteocalcin osteoblast differentiation markers.
Furthermore, we found that astrocytes, microglia, and ependymal cells also express Atrn protein.
Insulin protein was detected in astrocyte conditioned medium.
