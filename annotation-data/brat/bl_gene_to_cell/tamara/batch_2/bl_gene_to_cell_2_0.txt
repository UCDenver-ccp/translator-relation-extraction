In BALF cytospins, both MMP-8 protein and mRNA expression were observed in epithelial cells, macrophages, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs).
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibits collagen synthesis in osteoblastic cell lines and primary osteoblast-like cells.
We found no relation between arterial wall inflammation and monocyte count or monocyte subsets, namely CD14+CD16-, CD14+CD16+, CD14+CD16?++, CCR5+, CD18+, CD11b+, or CD11c+ monocytes.
HMSH2 protein was predominantly expressed in myeloblasts and promyelocytes.
Here, we report that this cell line expressed certain markers specific to retinal ganglion cells such as Rbpms, Brn3b (Pou4f2), Brn3c (Pou4f3), Thy1 and ?-synuclein (Sncg), and some other markers of neuronal cells (beta-III tubulin, NeuN and MAP2).
These cells also expressed Nucleostemin, Cyclin D1, Notch1 and Survivin which are commonly expressed in stem cells.
An increase in the number of AQP4-positive parietal cells and KCNQ1-positive parietal cells was observed.
TGF-beta1 activated p42/p44 MAPK transiently in normoxic myocytes.
Pharmacological dissection of neuronal vs. astrocytic connexins shows that astrocytic Cx43 contribute to seizure formation to a significantly higher extent than neuronal Cx36.
Intracellular cytokine staining confirmed that transfer of CD4+CD25+ T cells induced IL-10 expression in recipient CD4+ T cells, but no increase in IL-10 expression was detected in airway macrophages, dendritic cells, or B cells.
These findings suggested noggin-transduced hBMMSCs produced more photoreceptor cells than EGF-induced cells.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) has been implicated in the differentiation of several cell types, such as adipocytes, monocytes, and epidermal keratinocytes.
PAR-2 is expressed in airway epithelial cells, where they are activated by mast cell tryptase, neutrophil proteinase 3, or trypsin.
Significant correlation was found between CD68+ cells and eosinophils or PCNA positive cells on epithelium.
Additionally, the co-localizations of Gem/active-caspase-3 and Gem/TUNEL-positive cells were detected in RGCs.
Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1) regulates the differentiation, proliferation, and survival of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system.
Regucalcin reveals insulin resistance in liver cells.
[WITHDRAWN Control of platelet function by Epac protein.]
Both NS and AFS cells were differentiated into astrocyte (GFAP+), oligodendrocyte (GalC+), neuron (NF+, NSE+ and MAP2+), adipocyte (LPL+ and PPAR?-D+), osteoblast (Osteonectin+ and Osteocalcin+), myocyte (myf-6+ and myoD+) and endothelium (CD31+, CD34+, CD144+ and eNOS+).
In stark contrast to Th17 cells and M1 macrophages, high salt blunted the alternative activation of BM-derived mouse macrophages stimulated with IL-4 and IL-13, M(IL-4+IL-13) macrophages.
