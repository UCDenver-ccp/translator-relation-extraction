ENT contained neurons and glial cells expressing various markers of maturity, such as synaptophysin, neuronal nuclei-specific protein (NeuN), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and were electrophysiologically active.
[Effect of HIV Tat protein on CCR5 expression in monocytes and infection with monocyte-tropic HIV strains].
We previously identified the upper furin-positive cells as parietal cells, and here, we identify the lower furin-positive cells as chief cells.
Ahi1 deficiency promotes the degradation of endocytic TrkB and reduces TrkB signaling in neuronal cells.
Secretory cell actin-binding proteins: identification of a gelsolin-like protein in chromaffin cells.
Platelet (P-) selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) mediate accumulation of neutrophils in brain.
In parallel to the Th1/Th2 paradigm, antigen-presenting cells (APC) are divided into classically activated APC (dendritic cells/effector macrophages) and alternatively activated APC (IL-4-induced, alternatively activated macrophages/IL-10-induced, immature dendritic cells).
In addition, LPS significantly decreased protein level of Cav-1 and SYP in neurons by activating microglia cells.
Moreover, knockdown of NMB or NMBR accelerated apoptosis in osteoclast lineage cells by inducing caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bim expression.
Binding of Lys-plasminogen to monocytes/macrophages.
Schwann cells express HER2 and HER3 but little HER4.
Mechanistically, reduced tolerization of Nod2-null macrophages was mediated by recognition of bacteria through Nod1 because it was abolished in macrophages deficient in Nod1 and Nod2.
CXCR4 and CXCL12 were homogeneously expressed within tumor cells, while CXCR7 was mainly detected in tumor endothelial cells and CXCL11 in pericytes.
HAS2 mRNA was usually predominant in chondrocytes, whereas synovial cells contained increased amounts of HAS1.
Equal amounts of the chimeric viruses were used to infect T-lymphocyte cell lines (A3.01 and MT-2), coreceptor cell lines (U373-MAGI-CCR5/CXCR4), primary blood T-lymphocytes (PBL) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM).
Differences in altered expression of L-selectin and Mac-1 in monocytes and neutrophils.
Insulin-resistant adipocytes and hepatocytes models were established.
Lymphocytes surrounding granulomas were mostly CCR5+ and CXCR3+ T cells with CD4+ and CD8+ cells at similar frequencies.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that transplanted DPSCs expressed the early neuronal marker N-tubulin, the neuronal specific intermediate filament protein NF-M, the postmitotic neuronal marker NeuN, and glial GFAP.
Inhibitory neurons of the dorsal horn derive from postmitotic neurons that express Pax2, Lbx1 and Lhx1/5, and diversify during maturation.
