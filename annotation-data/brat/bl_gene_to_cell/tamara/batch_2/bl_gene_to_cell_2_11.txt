Mast cell-derived tryptase can activate protease activated receptor type-2 (PAR-2) of BSM cells.
We examined its effect on the proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells.
Interleukin-6 and interleukin-11 act synergistically with thrombopoietin and stem cell factor to modulate ex vivo expansion of human CD41+ and CD61+ megakaryocytic cells.
Functional role of endothelial CXCL16/CXCR6-platelet-leucocyte axis in angiotensin II-associated metabolic disorders.
The frequencies of peripheral CD4+CD25+Foxp3- T cells and CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells were increased in AECOPD patients, whereas the frequency of CD4+CD25-Foxp3+ T cells was increased in SCOPD patients without receiving systemic treatment.
These neurons are parvalbumin, choline acetyltransferase, neuronal nitric oxide synthase, calretinin and calbindin immunoreactive.
The interactions of purified recombinant human leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) on the clonogenicity of HL60 cells and U937 cells were studied in vitro.
Transcripts for protein zero, peripheral myelin protein 22 and myelin basic protein were detected in differentiated stem cells following co-culture with neuronal cells.
Microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, but not neurons, express TLR2.
Immunohistochemically, these atypical lymphoid cells expressed CD20, Bcl2, Bcl6 and, heterogeneously, IRF4/MUM1.
CD14+ monocytes were cocultured with SaOS-4/3 cells to elucidate how SaOS-4/3 cells and NLCs supported CD14+ monocytes for a long period.
Th1 cells preferentially express CXCR3, CCR5 and CCR6, while CCR3 and CCR4 are predominantly expressed by Th2 cell subsets.
Positive staining of ?-III Tubulin, glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) and myelin basic protein (MBP) showed differentiation into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.
EA.hy926 endothelial cells, THP-1 monocytes and PMA-differentiated macrophages were treated with Pleiotrophin (10 and 100ng/ml).
Although weak Stat3 staining was detected in damaged neurons in the ischemic region, activated microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells clearly expressed Stat3 in this region.
C5a receptor (C5aR, CD88) is a receptor originally described on neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages but recently found on hepatocytes, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and tissue mast cells.
CD34+ cell-derived CD14+ precursor cells develop into Langerhans cells in a TGF-beta 1-dependent manner.
The number of the inflammatory cells, vimentin-positive astrocytes, and GFAP-positive astrocytes were quantitatively analyzed.
Interestingly, BMca differed from BMfem regarding frequencies of B cells, their expression of CD80 and CXCR4, T cells, and plasma cells.
