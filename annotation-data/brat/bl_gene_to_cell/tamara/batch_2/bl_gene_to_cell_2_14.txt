Neurons generated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells demonstrate loss of the ANKS1B-encoded protein AIDA-1, a brain-specific protein highly enriched at neuronal synapses.
Moreover, Irf8(-/-) monocyte-dendritic cell progenitors do not express Klf4 messenger RNA.
The adaptor protein SLP-76 is expressed in T lymphocytes and myeloid cells and is a substrate for ZAP-70 and Syk.
Unexpectedly, CXCL12 selectively down-regulated CXCR4 on transmigrating monocytes, but not T cells.
In type III cells, Nox2, besides Nox 1, 3, and 4, Noxo1, and Noxa1, were specifically expressed, unlike in other taste bud cells.
CD151, a member of the tetraspanin family of cell membrane proteins, is widely expressed in epithelial, endothelial and muscle cells as well as platelets and megakaryocytes.
IL-7 alone did not induce IL-3 or granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF) mRNA.
Expansion of total nucleate cells, CD34(+) cells and CD34(+) CD38(-) cells was investigated.
IL-18, previously named interferon-gamma inducing factor, is produced by monocytes/macropharges, dendritic cells, B cells and other APC cells as well as by astrocytes, microglia.
IL-16 was abundantly present in CD4(+) T cells, followed by CD20(+) B, CD8(+) T, CD83(+) dendritic cells, and Mac-1(+) microglia.
Small subpopulations of CD34+ CD38+ were committed to B cells, T cells and erythroid cell lineages.
Furthermore, pleural mesothelial cells, bronchiolar epithelial cells, endothelial cells of large blood vessels and alveolar macrophage surfaces exhibited pan-cadherin immunoreactivity.
Six monoclonal antibodies specific for muscle cell actin (HHF35), smooth muscle cell actin (CGA7), vimentin, desmin, macrophages (HAM56) and endothelial cells were used for the immunocytochemical study.
Several studies have reported that astrocytes express MCT4, whereas neurons express MCT2.
We previously demonstrated that monocytes/macrophages express RCAS1.
In resting platelets, Lyn is constitutively bound to GPVI in an activated state and platelets lacking Lyn exhibit defective collagen adhesion like that of platelets with GPVI receptors lacking the PRD.
Among lymphocytes, the percentages of CD20+, CD21+ and CD22+ cells remained similar, with no age-related changes, but the proportion of CD5+ cells within lymphocytes or B cells decreased.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma regulates the expression of alveolar macrophage macrophage colony-stimulating factor.
Histopathological and immunohistochemistry procedures were done in order to get a panel of inflammatory positive cells for CD3 (T lymphocytes), CD45RA (B lymphocytes), CD18 (beta 2 integrin), CD163 (ED2 protein), CD54 (ICAM-1), and MAC 387 (monocytes and macrophages).
We report here that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) can increase the expression level of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) mRNA in a variety of mesenchymal cell lines derived from osteoblasts, bone marrow stromal cells, fibroblasts, and myoblasts.
