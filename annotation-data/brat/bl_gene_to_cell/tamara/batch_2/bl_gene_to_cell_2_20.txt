However, mitochondrial dysfunction in WT neurons occurs at lower concentrations of TNF-alpha when neurons are directly treated with TNF-alpha or co-cultured with TNF-alpha-treated microglia than iNOSKO neurons similarly treated.
IL-2- and IL-2R-deficient mice are not completely devoid of Foxp3+ cells, but rather lack population of mature CD4+CD25+Foxp3high Treg cells and contain few immature CD4+CD25-Foxp3low T cells.
Additionally, Tnfr2 deficiency impaired glomerular infiltration of CD11c(+) cells, but not neutrophils.
Monocyte/macrophage production of TNF-alpha is dependent on the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38.
It labels neutrophils and monocytes via phagocytosis, with uptake mediated by the phagocytic receptor CD11b/CD18 in neutrophils.
PECAM-1 is expressed on platelets, certain T cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and vascular endothelial cells and is involved in a range of cellular processes, though the role of PECAM-1 in platelets is unclear.
The DOCK8 protein is critical for cytoskeletal organization, and deficiency impairs dendritic cell transmigration, T-cell survival, and NK cell cytotoxicity.
AQP3, AQP7, AQP9 and AQP11 have been identified in boar sperm, and they are crucial for sperm maturation and osmoregulation.
CC chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR2 are both expressed on activated macrophages and T cells.
Platelet phagocytosis and processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein as a mechanism of macrophage activation in atherosclerosis.
Runx2 caused the accumulation of HIF-1? protein in ATDC5 chondrocytes and HEK293 cells under normoxic conditions.
It was unclear whether this B220+/CD5+/Mac-1- peritoneal B cell population represented aberrantly CD5 expressing B-2 cells or Mac-1- B-1 cells.
MMP-3 was observed in ischemic neurons, oligodendrocytes, microvasculature, and reactive microglia/macrophages.
BMP2 induces p38 phosphorylation in pre-fusion osteoclasts and increases SMAD phosphorylation around osteoclast precursor fusion.
PLP-A was expressed in both trophoblast giant cells and spongiotrophoblast cells, whereas PLP-B was expressed in decidual and spongiotrophoblast cells.
The pattern of S100A4 expression differed significantly from that of the proinflammatory proteins S100A9 and S100A12, which were restricted to phagocytes and granulocytes.
Following neuronal induction of murine and human ADAS cells, Western blot analysis confirmed GFAP, nestin, and NeuN protein expression.
Smoking induced a Th17-type of airway inflammation, characterized by neutrophils, macrophages, B cells and increased levels of IL-17, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1.
The osteoclast-like giant cells were negative for GATA3, uroplakin II, thrombomodulin, and AE1/3, providing additional support to a reactive origin for these cells.
Cell activity, as well as expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in astrocytes, were detected.
