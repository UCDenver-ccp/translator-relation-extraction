Thrombin-stimulated platelets increased monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) expression by monocytes.
Immunofluorescence distribution of alpha tubulin, beta tubulin and microtubule-associated protein 2 during in vitro maturation of cerebellar granule cell neurones.
CD11b(+) dendritic cells were the major producers of CXCL1, CXCL5, and CXCL9, while CXCL2 was mainly induced in macrophages.
The Rab GTPase-activating protein TBC1D4 (AS160) controls trafficking of the glucose transporter GLUT4 in adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells.
Immunohistochemical analyses of non-tumour liver tissues showed that BRM protein was expressed in hepatocytes and bile-duct epithelial cells, whereas BRG1 protein was expressed in bile-duct epithelial cells, but not in hepatocytes.
CXCL10+ exocrine cells were surrounded by CXCR3+ T cells.
Effects of low doses of Tat-PIM2 protein against hippocampal neuronal cell survival.
These epithelial-like cells expressed the corneal epithelial cell specific marker cytokeratin3/cytokeratin12.
The mobilization and infused doses of valpha24-vbeta11(iNKT cells) lymphocytes and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+, CD4+CD25+FoxP3+CD62L+, regulatory T cells were analyzed.
Stat4 is expressed in activated peripheral blood monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages at sites of Th1-mediated inflammation.
CD28+ and CD28-CD4+ T cells could not be distinguished by the levels of bax or bcl-xL protein; however, CD4+CD28- T cells expressed higher amounts of bcl-2 protein than did CD4+CD28+ T cells.
Before exercise testing, IPAH patients showed elevated Th2 lymphocytes, regulatory T lymphocytes, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, whilst Th1/Th17 lymphocytes and IL-4 were reduced.
Using flow-cytometry, we differentiated monocytes into CD14(++)CD16(-) and CD16(+) cells, which we further subdivided into CD14(++)CD16(+) and CD14((+))CD16(+) cells.
TLR2 and CD14 were expressed by endothelial cells, fibroblasts, lymphocytes and plasma cells.
In neuron-glial mixed cultures, mPGES-1 was co-induced with cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) specifically in microglia, but not in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes or neurons.
Small basophilic cells defined PRCC1 and large eosinophilic cells defined PRCC2.
p25 translocated to the nucleus in ER-stressed neurons, whereas p35/Cdk5 was perinuclear in control neurons.
Cells with Arg1 expression were mostly leukocytes, morphologically resembling polymorphonuclear neutrophils, and showed CD15 expression.
Striosomal projection neurons had a higher GluR1:GluR2 ratio than did matrix projection neurons.
Th17 cells and induced Foxp3+ T regulatory cells are in reciprocal position in the T cell lineage commitment governed by TGF-beta and IL-6.
