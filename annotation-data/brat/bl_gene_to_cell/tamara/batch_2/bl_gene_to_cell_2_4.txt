Local proliferation of T cell is induced by IL-2 and IL-15 and that of macrophage/monocyte lineage is done by M-CSF, GM-CSF and G-CSF.
NSCs could differentiated into astrocyte (GFAP(+)), oligodendrocyte (GalC(+)), neuron (NF(+), NSE(+) and MAP2(+)) and myocyte (myf-6(+) and myoD(+)).
Annexin 2 was overexpressed twofold in SaOSLM2 osteoblastic cells as a fusion protein with green fluorescent protein.
Autologous Th17 cells promoted inflammatory and antigen-presenting functions of GO fibrocytes; conversely, fibrocytes enhanced Th17 cell-function and recruited Th17 cells in a macrophage inflammatory protein 3 (MIP-3)/CCR6-dependent manner.
Although neurons have been reported to express TLR4, the function of TLR4 activation in neurons remains unknown.
Prealbumin, albumin and transferrin were present in lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes, whereas the cellular variants of orosomucoid and haptoglobin were present only in granulocytes.
Percentage and absolute numbers of CD19+ (B lymphocytes), CD2+ (total T cells), CD3+ (immunocompetent T cells), CD3+CD4+ (helper T cells), CD3+CD8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocytes), CD4+CD29+ and CD4+CD45-RA+ (helper/inducer and suppressor/inducer subpopulations of helper lymphocytes).
P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 is a ligand for L-selectin on neutrophils, monocytes, and CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells.
Monocyte-platelet aggregates (MPAs) form when Mon1, Mon2 or Mon3 monocyte subsets adhere to platelets.
Importantly, AILIM/ICOS-mediated polarization was evident in CD4+CD45RO+ memory T-cells and generated Th1 cells, but not in CD4+CD45RA+ naive T-cells and generated Th2 cells.
We finally demonstrate that macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is a major factor controlling RAE-1 expression in microglia.
Sox4 facilitates differentiation of lymphocytes, pancreatic beta cells, osteoblasts and acts in redundancy with Sox11 to promote neuronal differentiation.
[Roles of ERK5 in neuronal cells].
Direct cellular contact with stimulated T lymphocytes induces TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in monocytes which in turn induce functions in fibroblast-like synoviocytes.
First, we found that endogenous Mesp1 indirectly induces Meis1 and Meis2 in endothelial cells derived from embryonic stem cells.
Frequent viral infections and delayed CD4+ cell recovery following CD34+ cell-selected autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.
The expanded mantle zone lymphocytes were CD20+, Bcl2+, PAX5+, and MUM1- with less number of CD3+ T cells admixed.
Becn1 deficiency resulted in the stabilization of MEKK3 and aberrant p38 activation in neutrophils, and mediated neutrophil-B cell interaction through Cxcl9/Cxcr3 chemotaxis.
Finally, G-CSF could increase IL-6 release by in vitro cultured monocytes, fibroblasts, and mesenchymal stem cells.
A fluorometric quantitative erythrophagocytosis assay using human THP-1 monocytic cells and PKH26-labelled red blood cells.
