The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is expressed in bile duct cholangiocytes but not hepatocytes, whereas SULT1E1 is expressed in hepatocytes but not cholangiocytes.
In contrast, double IHC showed that IL-4 and IL-5 immunoreactivity was predominantly associated with eosinophils and mast cells, with few IL-5 or IL-4 immunoreactive CD3+ T cells detectable.
Also, CCR5 was fourfold higher on CD14(+) pleural mononuclear cells than on CD4(+) lymphocytes.
In HIVE, TUNEL+/p24+ cells were 0.4 +/- 0.2% of the total p24+ cell population, which was lower than the frequency of TUNEL+/CD68+ cells (1.9 +/- 0.7%) in the total CD68+ macrophage population.
The total number of monocytes and the proportion of the more mature CD16+/CD14+ monocytes were measured.
We demonstrated that both mesothelial cells and macrophages each express both CD54 and CD11a, important adhesion molecules.
Using an affinity-purified anti-myogenin antibody, three stages of mouse myoblast C2C12 cells during myogenesis could be identified: proliferating myoblasts as myogenin-negative mononucleated cells, differentiating myoblasts as myogenin-positive mononucleated cells, and myotubes as myogenin-positive multinucleated cells.
We examined whether MV infects Langerhans cell-like dendritic cells (LCs) generated from CD14(+) monocytes in the presence of GM-CSF, IL-4, and TGF-beta1.
EMP(51), EMP(54)-lymphocyte conjugates, platelet expression of P-selectin, CD11b expression in leukocytes, and platelet-lymphocyte conjugates were also increased in patients with the MS.
CD14-positive (CD14 + macrophages) in the monocytes prepared from human peripheral blood cells differentiated into macrophages (CD14 +) presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or into osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) in the presence of M-CSF plus receptor activator of NFkappaB ligand.
Rapid CD4+ T-cell responses to bacterial flagellin require dendritic cell expression of Syk and CARD9.
Immunofluorescent double staining showed that VSIG4 was present on CD68(+) macrophages, but absent from CD3(+) T cells, CD31(+) endothelial cells, and CK-18(+) epithelial cells.
To examine direct effects of IL-4 and STAT6 on TLR4 expression of U-937 monocytic cells.
The macrophage-specific colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1, M-CSF) regulates the survival, growth and differentiation of monocytes.
Our results showed that these cells are clonogenic, express skeletal progenitor cell markers Pax7, ALDH1, Myod, and Desmin and the stem cell markers Nanog, Sox2, and Oct3/4 significantly elevated over controls.
Equal numbers of LCH cells and macrophages produced IL-10, whereas IL-3 was produced by T cells and macrophages.
Activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway by LiCl or Wnt3a increased beta-catenin protein levels in monocytes but not in granulocytes.
IL-13 also increased eotaxin-3 expression in alveolar epithelial cells, but the level of eotaxin mRNA was lower in alveolar epithelial cells than in airway epithelial cells.
IL-2 imprints human naive B cell fate towards plasma cell through ERK/ELK1-mediated BACH2 repression.
Additional exploration revealed that "pro-inflammatory" (CD14(+)CD16(+)) monocytes produced similar levels of hepatocyte growth factor in response to interferon-? as "classical" (CD14(+)CD16(-)) monocytes, and that CD14(+) monocytes but not CD4(+) T cells express the hepatocyte growth factor receptor c-Met.
