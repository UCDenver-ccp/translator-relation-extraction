Gfi1N382S-expressing Csf1-/- cells formed neutrophils.
The cells were negative for the hematopoietic cell markers (CD45, CD34, CD14, CD3, CD19, CD16/56, and HLA-DR).
Recent studies showed a novel sperm protein named Bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI), which takes part in the sperm-oocyte fusion process.
The neuronal splicing factor neuro-oncological ventral antigen 1 (NOVA1) is enriched in normal fibroblasts.
Conversely, CD4+CXCR4+ lymphocytes were less abundant in PHI than in HD (443 +/- 337 vs 673 +/- 339 cells/microl), whereas CD4+CCR5+ lymphocytes were substantially comparable (169 +/- 167 vs 126 +/- 60 cells/microl).
ERK5 and MEK5 were present in RGCs and glial cells.
All cell lines established were CD4+/CD8 divided by T-lymphocytes, except for one cell line of CD4+/CD8+.
In hippocampal neuronal culture, the cell viability of STX1B(-/-) neurons was lower than that of WT or STX1A(-/-) neurons after 9?days.
Confocal microscopy analysis suggests that the high level of ErbB-4 protein in activated microglia/macrophages is probably due to phagocytosis of neuronal cells.
Expression of CXCR4 in the DG included cells that expressed nestin and GFAP as well as cells that appeared to be immature granule neurons expressing PSA-NCAM, calretinin, and Prox-1.
Single adult human CD34(+)/Lin-/CD38(-) progenitors give rise to natural killer cells, B-lineage cells, dendritic cells, and myeloid cells.
TRIM19-positive and TRIM19-negative cells in and around a perivascular cuff of CD68-positive macrophages.
Osteoclast precursors from these mice were cultured in the presence of RANKL and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) or co-cultured with stromal/osteoblastic cells from either genotype.
CD11b(+)CD45(+)CD39(+) cells were defined here as microglia.
The expression of Nestin, Sox2, CXCR4, and (stem cell markers), ?3-tubulin (a neural marker) GFAP (a glial marker) CNPase, SOX10 (oligodendrocyte markers) and NF-L in cells was analyzed by immunofluorescence and a Q-PCR.
Double labeling of either gelsolin mRNA or protein with markers of glial cells (Griffonia simplicifolia IB4 and CD11b for microglial cells, GFAP for astroglial cells) revealed that gelsolin was highly expressed by both activated microglia and astrocytes.
Is Gas6 protein associated with sticky platelet syndrome?
Some mast cells and endothelial cells expressed LIR-7.
IGF-1 and BMP-2 induces differentiation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells into chondrocytes-like cells.
Additionally, splenic monocytes were found to be the major source of CXCL10, CXCL9 and CCR2, whereas T cells were the main source of CXCR3 and CCR7.
