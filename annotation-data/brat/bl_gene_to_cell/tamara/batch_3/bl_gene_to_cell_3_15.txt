TLR2 may contribute in the development of MS and EAE diseases through the reinforcement of Th1/Th17 cell-related responses, downregulation of regulatory T cells, induction of IL-17+ ?? T cells, inhibition of oligodendrocyte maturation, induction of poly ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1)-dependent pathway in microglia, macrophages and astrocytes and inhibition of type I interferons expression.
Added MDP did not generate MGCs from CD14(+)/CD16(+) monocytes or dendritic cells but enhanced LGC formation from macrophages.
IL-4, -5, -13, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma mRNA-positive cells were visualized by in situ hybridization and T cells, B cells and neutrophils were enumerated using immunocytochemistry.
To identify immediate-early protein changes by artemin and GDNF in neuronal cells, we used a differential proteomics approach in SH-SY5y human neuronal cells treated with artemin or GDNF for 1 h.
To investigate the proteolytic effect of mast cell tryptase on eotaxin-1/CCL11, eotaxin-2/CCL24 and eotaxin-3/CCL26 produced by conjunctival fibroblasts.
In type I, neither platelets nor monocytes/macrophages express CD36; in type II, monocytes/macrophages express CD36 but platelets do not.
Relative percentages of monocytes and CD16+ cells and cell-surface expression of CD14 on CD14brightCD16- monocytes decreased.
Dickkopf1 mRNA and protein levels were increased in both pagetic osteoblast and stromal cell cultures, and interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 were overexpressed in pagetic osteoblasts.
Moreover, MV-educated fibroblasts increased IL-6, fibroblast activation protein and EGF expression simultaneously.
Instead, decreased expression of bcl-2 protein in SF lymphocytes compared to PB lymphocytes was demonstrated.
In ulcerative tissues, EGF was mostly distributed in monocytes and macrophages while EGFR was chiefly sited in monocytes.
Analysis of Egr-1 protein induction in murine peritoneal macrophages treated with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.
Monocyte subset analyses were performed (three distinct human monocyte subsets: classical CD14++CD16-, intermediate CD14++CD16+, and non-classical CD14+CD16++monocytes).
Our results indicate that myosin VIIa-positive cells are generated from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) co-cultured with PA6 cells; however, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) may not be a key molecule for induction of myosin VIIa-positive cells from the ESCs.
In order to compare the regulatory profiles of TARC production by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IFN-gamma, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 in keratinocytes and fibroblasts, HaCaT cells, a human keratinocyte cell line, and NG1RGB cells, a human skin fibroblast cell line, were used.
Platelet-agglutinating protein p37 from a thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura plasma forms complexes with platelet membrane glycoprotein IV (CD36).
Lnk is an adaptor protein expressed primarily in lymphocytes and hemopoietic precursor cells.
Epididymal secreted protein Crisp-1 and sperm function.
In addition, we show that whereas neuromedin U is expressed by monocytes and dendritic cells, GPR66/FM-3 is expressed by T cells and NK cells.
PAI-1 protein was found in breast adipocytes>omental preadipocytes>omental adipocytes>breast preadipocytes.
