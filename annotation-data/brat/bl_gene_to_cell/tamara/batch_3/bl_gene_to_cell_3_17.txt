Expression of CXCR7 in the dentate gyrus included cells that expressed nestin, GFAP and cells that appeared to be immature granule cells.
Furthermore, we found that astrocytes and ependymal cells also express chordin protein.
They comprise 3 elements: LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) expressed at the surface of leucocytes, and in particular lymphocytes, M01 or MAC-1 (CD11b/CD18), and p 150.95 (CD11c/CD18) expressed only on granulocytes, monocytes and macrophages.
Exogenous FGF18 also upregulated expression of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), the anabolic factor of chondrocytes, in P3 chondrocytes, but P8 cells maintained a low level of TGF-beta expression, suggesting a decrease in responsiveness of TGF-beta to FGF18 stimulation in the dedifferentiated chondrocytes.
Granulysin is a cytotoxic granule protein of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and natural killer cells.
RT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression of several stem cell markers, including OCT3/4, SOX2, REX1, and NANOG, in LEF1-positive HDDPCs, which could be differentiated into osteoblasts and neuronal cells.
Immunohistochemistry revealed that AT2 receptor protein was expressed in both osteoblasts and osteoclasts.
Defective expression of IL-21 by STAT3-deficient CD4(+) T cells resulted in diminished B-cell helper activity in vitro.
Signals from IL-17B-IL-17RB activated CCL20/CXCL1/IL-8/TFF1 chemokine expressions via the ERK1/2 pathway to promote cancer cell invasion, macrophage and endothelial cell recruitment at primary sites, and cancer cell survival at distant organs.
In vivo hepatocytes express Cx32 and Cx26.
Transcriptomic analysis of overexpressed SOX4 and SOX8 in TM4 Sertoli cells with emphasis on cell-to-cell interactions.
T cells, B cells, and L-selectin-positive lymphocytes showed similar increases.
Balloon cells and large dysplastic neurons in all specimens expressed Otx1, phospho-vimentin, Pax6 and BLBP, proteins normally expressed by cells in the embryonic ventricular zone.
In cord blood leukocytes, cell fractions with phenotypes CD45+/CD90-, CD45-/CD90+, CD34+/CD45+ were determined.
Stat3 proteins increased markedly in ALD, mainly in hepatocyte and proliferating biliary epithelial cell nuclei.
Thymic dendritic cells are negative for the stem cell antigen-2 (Sca-2), the B cell-specific form of CD45 (B220), the mouse macrophage markers Fc receptor and F4/80, and the granulocyte marker Gr-1.
Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulates the in vitro proliferation and differentiation of granulocytic and macrophage cells.
Expression of CD54, CD58, CD14, and HLA-DR on macrophages and macrophage-derived accessory cells and their accessory capacity.
Osteoblast primary cells from TIMP-1/Runx2 mice, but not from Runx2 mice, were able to differentiate into fully mature osteoblasts producing high osteocalcin levels.
An increased proportion of CD11b+ (Mac1) cells suggested the recruitment of macrophages.
