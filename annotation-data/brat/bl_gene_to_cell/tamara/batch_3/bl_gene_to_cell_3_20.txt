cells reprogramming into M1-like macrophage through Erk1/2 or p38-Stat3 pathway and involved in EAM.
Unlike control cortical neurons, both control and TLR3-deficient TG neurons were highly susceptible to HSV-1.
GDF9 and BMP15 induce development of antrum-like structures by bovine granulosa cells without oocytes.
These data demonstrate that zinc mediates positively the gene expression of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in the Th1 cell line and negatively TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-8 in the monocyte-macrophage cell line.
Increased expression of Col and Runx2 might indicate differentiation towards both osteoblast and fibroblast lineage.
Furthermore, secretion of leukemia inhibitory factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor was increased in cocultures of MSCs and B16-LacZ cells compared with B16-LacZ cells alone.
ICAM-1 and E-selectin on endothelial cells.
The relationship between CD25(+)CD4(+) T cells and Tr1 cells remains unclear.
However, single LYVE-1+ cells, also positive for Iba1 and CD68 were present, indicating LYVE-1+ macrophages.
After treatment with 1 mg/mL EB for 12, 24, 48 h, the expression of OPG protein in MG63 osteoblast-like cells gradually decreased as time went by (P < 0.05), and the expression of RANKL protein in MG63 osteoblast-like and RANK protein in RAW264.7 pre-osteoclast cells gradually increased (P < 0.05).
Role of platelet GpIIb/IIIa receptors in the modulation of platelet plasminogen activator inhibitors type-1 (PAI-1) release.
Blocking of LFA-1 enhances expansion of Th17 cells induced by human CD14(+) CD16(++) nonclassical monocytes.
NLRP12 promoter region contains Blimp-1 (B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1)/PRDM1 binding site, and from the literature, it is reported that Blimp-1 reduces NLRP12 activity and expression in monocytes/macrophages.
GPR41 and GPR43 are a pair of mammalian G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed in human adipocytes, colon epithelial cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
Immunostaining located the immunoreactivity of Dll4 and Notch1 in endothelial cells, microglia/macrophages, tumor cells, and astrocytes.
Differential regulation of lubricin/superficial zone protein by transforming growth factor beta/bone morphogenetic protein superfamily members in articular chondrocytes and synoviocytes.
The protein for VEGF-A was detected immunohistochemically in oocytes, granulosa cells, and stroma cells from fetuses and girls.
Reg3? and Reg3? were expressed by diverging epithelial cell types; namely enterocytes, Paneth cells, and goblet cells.
TLR2 and TLR9 also regulate B cell TLR4 expression, demonstrating that TLR cross-talk controls B cell responses at multiple levels.
In contrast, phorbol ester-induced differentiation of promonocytic cell lines into macrophage-like cells produced a large induction of cyclin T1 protein expression from nearly undetectable levels, while Cdk9 protein levels remained at a constant high level.
