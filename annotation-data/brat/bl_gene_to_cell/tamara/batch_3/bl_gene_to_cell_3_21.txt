Multiple biopsy specimens were collected and stained for macrophages, T cells, plasma cells, fibroblast-like synoviocytes, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by immunohistochemistry.
CD8+ T cells were more numerous than CD4+ lymphocytes.
Diverse transcriptional response of CD4+ T cells to stromal cell-derived factor SDF-1: cell survival promotion and priming effects of SDF-1 on CD4+ T cells.
Leukemic cells of CLL are CD20+/CD23+/CD5+/CD43+/CD3-, whereas benign reactive infiltrates are composed of CD20-/CD23-/CD5+/CD43+/CD3+ T-cells.
PCNA was not found in PMN or T cells, but a small proportion of macrophages were PCNA+.
In lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages and PMC, we could observe the cells that expressed IL-16 protein.
Identification of novel Runx2 targets in osteoblasts: cell type-specific BMP-dependent regulation of Tram2.
Double IHC for Ihh/CD68 showed that Ihh(+) cells were macrophages.
P21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) regulates glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity in neuronal cells.
Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is expressed in adipose tissue, macrophages, endothelial cells, and osteoblasts by parathyroid hormone administration.
We also compared gene expression profiles of Wnt16-treated osteoblasts to canonical Wnt3a- and non-canonical Wnt5a-treated osteoblasts.
p53(-/-) hepatocytes expressing inducible p53 and primary wild type hepatocytes were treated to induce p53 expression.
Specific isoform patterns were also detected for NCX1 and NCX3 in cultured cortical neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes.
Neurons in the molecular layer, i.e., basket cells and stellate cells, showed moderate hybridization signals for NMDAR1 and NMDAR2D and low signal for NMDAR2C.
Cells with the morphology of lymphocytes, macrophages and giant cells expressed TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-4 protein.
Interleukin 2 (IL-2) and granulocytes-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are activators of the lymphocyte and granulocyte/macrophage series, respectively.
GluR2 immunoreactivity is present equally within vulnerable neurons (i.e., motor neurons and calretinin-immunoreactive neurons) as well as nonvulnerable neurons (i.e., calbindin-immunoreactive neurons and dorsal horn neurons).
The defective APC function of macrophages generated in vitro with M-CSF and IL-6 was mainly due to the production of TGF-beta1 by macrophages.
Activated monocytes (CD11b, HLA-DR, CD14, CD16), monocyte-platelet aggregates (CD41/CD14), activated platelets (CD41/CD62) and PMPs were analyzed by flow cytometry.
Cells expressing CD45 and CD34 but lacking CD38 and lineage antigens (CD45+CD34+CD38-Lin- cells) are well-documented hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and CD45+CD34-CD38-Lin- cells are probably less mature HSCs.
