(pp60)Src is a protein involved in signal transduction and is mainly expressed in neurones, platelets, and osteoclasts.
After neurons are ready to accept IL-6 fully, microglia release IL-6 to neurons.
Comparison of p56lck and p59fyn protein expression in thymocyte subsets, peripheral T cells, NK cells, and lymphoid cell lines.
Individual TGF-beta1 values inversely correlated with the number of circulating neutrophils and the frequency of marrow CD34+/CD33+ cells.
The H-161 cells were treated with differentiation-inducing agents, i.e., sodium butyrate, hemin, retinoic acid, DMSO, vitamin D3, and PMA alone or in combination with IL-1 alpha, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, granulocyte-CSF, macrophage-CSF, granulocyte/macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF), and Con A and tested for the production of IL-1 inhibitor.
The amounts of three monocyte subsets ("classical" CD14++CD16-, "intermediate" CD14++CD16+ and "non-classical" CD14+CD16++) and their associations with monocyte-platelet aggregates (MPAs) were measured by flow cytometry.
Internalization of FITC-transferrin also increased in Myo1e-overexpressing podocytes relative to control cells.
FTY720 functionally antagonizes sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1P1) on T cells and consequently inhibits S1P/S1P1-dependent lymphocyte egress from secondary lymphoid organs.
NGF immunoreactivity was observed in Leydig cells and strong TrkA signals were present in Sertoli cells.
AIC patients exhibited a high number of CD34(+), CD34(+)/CD38(+), and CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells; high frequency of granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units in the BM mononuclear cell fraction; high colony recovery in LTBMCs; and normal LTC-IC frequency.
CD4+/Leu-7+ cells do not exhibit any natural killer cell activity.
Steady state migratory RelB+ langerin+ dermal dendritic cells mediate peripheral induction of antigen-specific CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells.
NF-kappaB activation, CD11b/CD18 expression, and the production of TNF-alpha, IL-8, and IL-6 in monocytes and granulocytes were inhibited by NCR in vitro.
2) All TrkC neurons had three subunits, P2X4, P2X5, and P2X6, and made up 32% of the total neurons.
A recent study showed that various blood cells express sialophorin and that there are two molecular forms: lymphocyte/monocyte sialophorin and platelet/neutrophil sialophorin.
Gata4-/- cells contributed to adrenocortical cells in these chimeras, and these cells also expressed GATA-6.
Two additional myeloid cell populations, CD14 positive macrophages and CD11c-positive DCs, were also identified.
LIR-2 is expressed by all monocytes and dendritic cells, whereas LIR-1 is additionally expressed by B cells and subsets of T and NK cells.
A subset of CCR7+ T cells coexpressed CXCR3 and CCR5.
Expression of IGF-I and EGF was upregulated in human osteoblast cells treated with BMP-6.
