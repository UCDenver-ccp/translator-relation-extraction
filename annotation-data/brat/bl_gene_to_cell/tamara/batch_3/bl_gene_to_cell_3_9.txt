In the direct peri-lesional rim, CTGF expression was confined to invading vimentin+, GFAP- fibroblastoid cells, endothelial and smooth muscle cells of laminin+ vessels, and GFAP+ reactive astrocytes.
In addition, besides intense BMP2 expression in almost all neurons, we found BMP2 expression in astrocytes and ependymal cells.
Other cytokines, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IFN alpha beta, granulocyte-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, IL-3, TNF-alpha, and TNF-beta were compared to IL-1 for their ability to induce a PMN influx into the peritoneum.
Peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) is the third most abundant protein in red blood cells (RBCs).
CD123 plasmacytoid dendritic cells, PD1+ T follicular helper cells, CD25 or FOXP3+ regulatory T cells, and TIA1/granzyme B cytotoxic cells were never numerous.
Candida albicans uses the surface protein Gpm1 to attach to human endothelial cells and to keratinocytes via the adhesive protein vitronectin.
PSGL-1 regulates platelet P-selectin-mediated endothelial activation and shedding of P-selectin from activated platelets.
And the expression of Iba1, GFAP and HMGB1 in I/R rats was decreased by apelin-13 treatment indicating the inhibition of microglia, astrocytes and other inflammatory cells.
DPP4(+)?fibroblasts, ADAM12(+)?pericytes).
Th2-type cytokine, IL-4 significantly increased, whereas IL-6, CD4+T cells, CD4+/CD8+ ratio and CD3+ T cells decreased.
STAT-1 mediates the stimulatory effect of IL-10 on CD14 expression in human monocytic cells.
Target cells were identified with MAb to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; astrocytes), CD68 (activated macrophages) and Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA-1; microglia, endothelial cells).
PDAC cells produce IL35 to recruit monocytes via CCL5 and induce macrophage to promote angiogenesis via expression of CXCL1 and CXCL8.
Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that SPINK2 protein is present in male germ cells at all developmental stages, including in testicular spermatogenic cells, testicular sperm, and mature sperm.
Plasticity of Foxp3(+) T cells reflects promiscuous Foxp3 expression in conventional T cells but not reprogramming of regulatory T cells.
Phospho-p38MAPK colocalized with activated microglial cells, but not astrocytes.
We have identified functional EGF receptors (EGFR, ErbB1/HER-1) on peripheral blood monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages.
The intravenous administration of IGF-I after SCI activated Akt, attenuated GSK-3beta, inhibited p35 activation, diminished tau hyperphosphorylation, ended microglia and astrocyte activation, inhibited neuron loss, and significantly improved neurological dysfunction.
Mesenchymal stromal cell-derived CCL2 suppresses plasma cell immunoglobulin production via STAT3 inactivation and PAX5 induction.
Langerin/CD207(+) cells within this population appeared later than dermal dendritic cells, i.e. langerin-negative cells.
