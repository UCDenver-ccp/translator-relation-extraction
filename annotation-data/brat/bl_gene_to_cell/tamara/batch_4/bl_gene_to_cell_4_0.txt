Immunophenotypic analysis revealed increased circulating CD21+ B-cells and CD5+ T-cells, reflected by higher counts of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells.
Connexin-32 is expressed primarily in oligodendrocytes and connexin-43 in astrocytes in adult brain.
Differential activation of Th1 and Th2 CD4+ cells by murine brain microvessel endothelial cells and smooth muscle/pericytes.
IL-2 had no effect on megakaryocytes generated from CD34(+) cells stimulated with IL-3 and SCF.
Biosynthesis of the two forms was compared by using sialophorin of CEM cells and sialophorin of MOLT-4 cells (another lymphoblastoid line) as models for lymphocyte/monocyte sialophorin and platelet/neutrophil sialophorin, respectively.
The cellular migration is mediated through chemokines including interleukin-8, macrophage chemotactic protein-1, and macrophage inhibitory protein-1 in the periprosthetic tissues.
Depletion of VCAM-1 interrupted the binding of macrophages to GBM cells and inhibited EGF-induced and macrophage-promoted GBM cell invasion.
Keratocyte derived fibroblasts in collagen matrices contained TSP-2 and TSP-3 mRNA, and the cells were immunoreactive for both proteins.
The embryonic stem cell markers (induced pluripotent stem cell markers) like Oct4, SOX2, Notch-2 and K19 genes were expressed in CD133 positive epidermal cells.
IL-21 has the potential to activate T cells, B cells, monocytes/macrophages and synovial fibroblasts in RA pathogenesis through activation of JAK-STAT, MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.
These cascades result in the production of immunosuppressive molecules (e.g., TGF-?, IL-10, IL-6, VEGF, and CCL2) and induction of immunosuppressive immune cells (e.g., regulatory T cells, tolerogenic dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells).
Stable monocytic cell lines (THP-1-Blue-CD14 cells) or primary monocytes were stimulated with ligands for TLR2, TLR4, and TLR8, including chemically inactivated HIV-1, alone, or in sequential combinations.
Coexpression of HCN2, HCN3 and HCN4 mRNA was detected in single neurons of all four neuronal cell types analysed.
CD3+ (T cell), CD4+ (helper T cell), CD8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic T cell), CD19+ (B cell), and CD16+/CD56+ (NK cell) were determined by using appropriate monoclonal antibodies in double colored flow cytometry.
Furthermore, considering leukocyte cells, VEGFR2 was negatively correlated to MMP9 protein levels.
After the training period, red and white blood cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, as well as interleukin-1b, interleukin-10, interleukin-6, and vascular endothelial growth factor levels were determined.
Although both cell lines displayed a constitutive expression of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF), M-CSF, interleukin (IL-) 1 alpha and IL-8, only CALU-3 cell line expressed IL-10, RANTES (Regulated upon Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted) and monocyte-activating protein (MCP)-1.
Small GTPase protein Rac-1 is activated with maturation and regulates cell morphology and function in chondrocytes.
IL-1b and COX-2 expression were induced in neuronal and glial cells.
IL-15 and IL-18 neutralization decreased NK cell functions, whereas IL-15 and IL-18 therapy improved NK cell activity.
