Syndecan-1, E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and alpha-catenin colocalize with syntenin at cell-cell contacts in epithelial cells, and coimmunoprecipitate with syntenin from extracts of these cells.
In expression analyses we show that VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 are preferentially expressed by cultured SVZ-derived doublecortin+ neuroblasts, while VGLUT3 is found on GFAP+ glial cells.
Binding and inactivation of the germ cell-specific protein phosphatase PP1gamma2 by sds22 during epididymal sperm maturation.
CHI3L1 gene encodes for a glycoprotein (HC-gp39 or YKL40) secreted by synovial fibroblasts, macrophages, neutrophil granulocytes and chondrocytes.
Interestingly, given recent studies highlighting the importance of TREM2 in microglia/monocytes in AD susceptibility and progression, B6 and APP/PS1 mice fed the western diet showed significant increases TREM2+ microglia/monocytes.
Knockdown or knockout of klf4 expression reduced the proliferation rate of p63+ stem cells, resulting in decreased numbers of p63+ stem cells, dlc-p63+ keratinocyte progenitors and dlc+ p63+ ionocyte progenitor cells.
Growth pattern, gene profiling (Oct-4, Nanog, Sox-2, Rex-1), cytoskeletal protein expression (vimentin, nestin) and tri-lineage differentiation potential into adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteocytes confirmed their mesenchymal stromal cell status.
Corticotropin-releasing factor decreases IL-18 in the monocyte-derived dendritic cell.
The differentiated mature neurons exhibited the specific neuron markers Map2 and ?-tubulin.
These cells did not express granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukin (IL) 1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-3, and IL-6.
IL-1beta and TNF-alpha also induce IL-15 in fibroblast like synoviocytes, which induces the production of IL-17 which in turn potentiates IL-1beta and TNF-alpha production in monocyte-macrophages.
Runx2 is also required for chondrocyte maturation, and Runx3 has a redundant function with Runx2 in chondrocyte maturation.
CD4+,CD25+,Foxp3+ T cells, but not CD4+,CD25- T cells, dose dependently inhibited macrophage colony-stimulating factor- and RANKL-dependent osteoclast formation.
Eight hours after exposure, before lymphocytes and monocytes had entered the dermal interstitium or epidermis, the keratinocytes expressed TNF-alpha and ICAM-1, whilst the endothelial cells expressed ELAM-1, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1.
In the DRGs, Cbln2 is expressed by TrkB+ and TrkC+ sensory neurons, but not by TrkA+ sensory neurons.
Our data provide evidence that p21 regulates the PCNA protein level in adult cardiomyocytes, which has implications for cardiomyocyte growth control.
P-selectin, which is located together with ?-amyloid precursor proteins in platelet ?-granules, is also found in endothelial cells.
Human monocytic cell line THP-1, THP-1 cells derived macrophages and primary macrophages were treated with LPS and TNF-? (positive control).
The alpha2beta1 integrin, a collagen receptor on platelets and megakaryocytes, is required for normal platelet function.
No immunolabelling for neuronal trkB-like proteins was observed, but trkB- and trkC-like proteins IR was found in non-neuronal cells.
