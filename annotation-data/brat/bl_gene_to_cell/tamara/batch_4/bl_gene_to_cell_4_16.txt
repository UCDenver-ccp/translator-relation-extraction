Most p35(+)CD4(+) T cells and EBI3(+)CD4(+) T cells expressed Treg-associated marker CD25.
To differentiate vascular adventitial fibroblastic cells from vascular endothelial cells, immunostaining for CD34 and CD31 was performed.
In lumbar CSF protein was 173 mg/dl, and nucleated cells 328/mm3 (polynuclear cells 6 and mononuclear cells 322).
We demonstrate that although MSP2-specific alphabeta and gammadelta T cell clones express many of the same genes, gammadelta T cell clones express high levels of genes associated with myeloid cells, including chemokines CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL6, and surface receptors CD68, CD11b, macrophage scavenger receptor 1, macrophage mannose receptor, and galectin-3.
MAP kinase phosphatase 2 regulates macrophage-adipocyte interaction.
Lactoferrin effects on phagocytic cell function.
Tim-3 expressions on peripheral CD3? T cells and CD8? T cells in ICH patients are significantly downregulated, while Tim-3 expressions on CD14? monocytes and CD16?CD56? NK cells are increased.
These results demonstrate that TCR expression by mature CD8+ T cells, as well as that of immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, is regulated by CD4-mediated signals acting on CD4+CD8+ thymocytes.
Serial sections stained for different types of APC, including B cells, interdigitating dendritic cells, and macrophages, demonstrate a close physical association between IL-2+ cells and macrophages.
The addition of anti-P-selectin glycoprotein ligand (PSGL-1) mAb almost completely inhibited the formation of platelet-monocyte aggregates as well as the number of platelets bound to monocytes.
A detailed analysis of inflammatory cells (neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages) as well as the expression of chemokines (CCL2, CCL4, CCL5, CCL13, CCL17, CCL21, CCL24, and CXCL8) was carried out in dermis skin samples from 35 dogs that were naturally infected with L. infantum.
CXCL16 is expressed on the surface of APCs including subsets of CD19(+) B cells and CD14(+) monocyte/macrophages, and functional CXCL16 is also shed from macrophages.
Periostin (POSTN or osteoblast specific factor) is an extracellular matrix protein originally identified as a protein highly expressed in osteoblasts.
Antigenic markers of platelet activation, CD63 and CD61-CD14 (platelet-monocyte aggregates), were measured with flow cytometry.
Expression of Pax-6, Otx-1, and Nurr-1 genes suggested neuroectodermal precursors in products encompassing neural stem cells, dopaminergic neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes.
Adiponectin is an adipocyte-specific protein with insulin-sensitizing properties.
Besides IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor supported the growth of the KMT-2 cells, but IL-1 alpha, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and erythropoietin did not.
Here we examined apoE expression in human THP-1 macrophages and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM).
Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells expressed oligodendroglial (neurite outgrowth inhibitor, Nogo-A; oligodendrocyte transcription factor, Olig-2) and neuronal (neuron-specific enolase, NSE; microtubule-associated protein-2a, MAP-2a; synaptophysin) cell markers.
It was found that interruption of astrocyte metabolism with fluorocitrate significantly reduced Fos protein expression in both astrocytes and neurons, whereas blockage of gap junctions with carbenoxolone clearly reduced Fos protein expression in neurons, but not in astrocytes.
