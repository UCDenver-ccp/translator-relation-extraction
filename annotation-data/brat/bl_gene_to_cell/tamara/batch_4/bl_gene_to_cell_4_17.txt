Moreover, the regulatory function of TIM-3 has been extended to other cells, such as Th17 cells, CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs), CD8(+) T cells and certain innate immune cells.
Immunophenotypic profiling of PBMCs protein demonstrated predominant proliferation of B cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 memory T cells following stimulation with purified ITPR1 protein.
CD5+/Mac-1- peritoneal B cells: a novel B cell subset that exhibits characteristics of B-1 cells.
Plasma cells and enterocytes were identified as CXCL10-producing cells.
Results showed these pbMNCs were fibroblast-like, had stromal morphology, were negative for CD34 and CD45, but positive for Vimentin and Collagen I, and had the multipotency to differentiate into adipocytes and osteoblasts.
MALP-2 and LPS exposure stimulated TLR4 protein expression in all three cell types; significantly more so in ATII cells than macrophages and TT1 cells.
Lyn is an Src family kinase present in B lymphocytes and myeloid cells.
SVZ-derived progenitors differentiate into both tbr1+ cortical glutamatergic neurons and calretinin+ interneurons.
Calgranulins comprise three proteins, S100A8 (Calgranulin A), S100A9 (Calgranulin B) and S100A12 (Calgranulin C) that are predominantly expressed by neutrophils, monocytes and activated macrophages.
In microvessels, motor neurons, and microglial cells from SOD1-mutant mice and in cultured neuronal cells, APC transcriptionally downregulated SOD1.
When monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were generated from CD16-positive monocytes by culture with macrophage colony-stimulating factor in vitro, then the MDMs maintained properties of their progeny with lower expression of CD14, CD163, and versican compared with CD14(++) CD16(-)  MDMs.
VEGF protein was detected mainly in erythroid cells, whereas myeloid cells and megakaryocytes exhibited a variable expression of the protein.
We observed that knockdown of NRF2 or NRF2-regulated antioxidants NQO1 and PRDX6 reduced melanocyte viability, but not viability of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, suggesting that melanocytes were preferentially dependent upon NRF2 activity for growth compared to other cutaneous cells.
During inflammation, P-selectin on activated platelets and endothelial cells initiates adhesion of leukocytes through interactions with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1).
Expression of apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2 and Bax in neurons was detected by immunohistochemistry. Neuronal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL.
Single clusters from four patients and a pool of eight larger clusters from another patient were manually picked and subjected to quantitative real-time PCR to evaluate the presence of SC (SOX9, AR), LC (INSL3, STAR, HSD3B1), peritubular myoid cells (ACTA2), fibroblasts (FSP1), endothelial cells (CD34), macrophages (CD68), undifferentiated spermatogonia (FGFR3), differentiating spermatogonia/spermatocytes (DDX4) and postmeiotic germ cells (PRM1).
Tfrc immunoreactivity was observed on pinealocytes and macrophages/microglia.
Grafted cells expressed the mature neuronal markers NF-200, MAP-5, and calbindin.
While CXCL12 was mainly found in schwannoma cells (S100?) in situ, its receptor CXCR4 is also partly found on CD11b-positive macrophages / microglia and its alternative receptor CXCR7 is also expressed by endothelial cells and macrophages.
Dendritic cells (DC), macrophages and B cells act as efficient APC.
