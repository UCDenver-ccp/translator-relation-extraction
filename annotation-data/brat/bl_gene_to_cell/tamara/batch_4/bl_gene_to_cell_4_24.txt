Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for endothelial cells (CD31), B cells (CD20), T cells (CD3), macrophages (CD68), collagen I and III, and myofibroblasts (?-smooth muscle actin).
SLURP1, a member of the lymphocyte antigen 6 protein family, is secreted by suprabasal keratinocytes.
Platelet-leukocyte formation was detected utilizing dual antibodies for a pan-platelet marker CD151, and CD14, a monocyte/macrophage marker.
Cytokine-induced expansion of human CD34+ stem/progenitor and CD34+CD41+ early megakaryocytic marrow cells cultured on normal osteoblasts.
The malignant cells express pan B-cell markers, including CD19, CD20 and CD22, and the T-cell marker CD5, whereas CD10 and CD23 expression are usually absent.
IRF7 message was localized to microglia and infiltrating leukocytes.
Immunohistochemistry showed that Stat1, Stat3, Stat4, Stat5b, and phosphotyrosine Stat3 localized to TG neurons, not surrounding satellite cells.
, Stra8-Cre spermatocytes.
Amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene expression was investigated in primary cultures of neurons, astrocytes, microglial cells and oligodendrocytes.
Human thymic epithelial cells produce IL-6, granulocyte-monocyte-CSF, and leukemia inhibitory factor.
EAT-2 overexpression also augments the expression of APC (macrophages and dendritic cells) surface markers.
These results were associated with significant downregulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-?B signaling pathways in microglia/macrophages, T cells, and astrocytes.
The following cells were identified: mast cells (AA1:tryptase), eosinophils (EG1:stored cationic protein and EG2: secretory form of cationic protein), monocytes/macrophages (CD68), neutrophils (elastase), CD3+ and CD8+ T cells (CD3 polyclonal Ab and CD8+ mAb, respectively).
Thus, GB-d1 cell-derived IL-1 beta stimulates HGF production in stromal fibroblasts and HGF up-regulated in the fibroblasts induces invasion of GB-d1 cells.
Eosinophil cationic protein is a unique protein from the noncore matrix of the eosinophil cells.
In addition to mediating transient interactions between endothelial cells and leukocytes, P-selectin has been reported to mediate adherence of platelets to monocytes and neutrophils via specific interaction with PSGL-1.
Socs1 expression is induced in the human keratinocytes HaCaT cell line through sequential activation of STAT1 and IRF-1.
Thus, the CD24 Ag permits discrimination between two populations of the B cell lineage present in adult BM: 1) A CD24(2+) cell population including "pre" pre-B cells (HLA-DR+, CD19+, CD10+/-, CD20-, CD21-, CD34+, CD37-, c mu-), "intermediate" pre-B cells (HLA-DR+, CD19+, CD10+, CD20+, CD21-, CD34-, CD37-, c mu-), and "true" pre-B cells (HLA-DR+, CD19+, CD10+, CD20+, CD21-, CD34-, CD37-, c mu+). 2) A CD24+ cell population including B cells of the standard phenotype (HLA-DR+, CD19+, CD10-, CD20+, CD21+, CD34-, CD37+, c mu-, sIgM+).
HOXA10 is strongly expressed in CD34+ normal marrow cells, markedly downregulated in CD34- marrow cells, and inactive in mature neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes.
We regarded CD34-positive, CD31-, CK14-, ASMA- and HCD-negative stromal cells to be CD34-positive stromal cells, and ASMA-positive, HCD-, CK14-, CD34- and CD31-negative stromal cells to be ASMA-positive stromal cells.
