ProEMAP/p43 and EMAP-II act on many levels and on many cell types including endothelial cells, immune cells and fibroblasts.
Highly significant changes were also found for WBC subtype counts, including granulocytes, CD4+ T cells and lymphocytes for VEGF and granulocytes and NK cells for ERCC3.
Recent evidence suggests that human peripheral blood CD4+CD25+ T cells are heterogeneous and contain both CD4+CD25(high) T cells with potent regulatory activity and many more CD4+CD25(low/med) nonregulatory T cells.
Staphylococcal superantigen-like protein 8 (SSL8) binds to tenascin C and inhibits tenascin C-fibronectin interaction and cell motility of keratinocytes.
Both T cells and macrophages infiltrated CCR5-deficient hippocampi, showing that CCR5 ligands (including RANTES/CCL5) are not critical to this response.
Oct-6 (SCIP/Tst-1) is expressed in Schwann cell precursors, embryonic Schwann cells, and postnatal myelinating Schwann cells: comparison with Oct-1, Krox-20, and Pax-3.
The present study aimed to define the ability of erythropoietin (EPO) to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells (c-kit(+)/sca-1(+)/lin-1(-); KSL-cells) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34(+) cells), including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 expressing hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34(+)/Flk-1(+) cells).
The intestinal stem cell marker Lgr5 gene was also activated in the endodermal cells, whereas the Msi1, Ephb2, and Dcamkl1 intestinal stem cell markers were not.
In patients with high neurodegeneration, immunophenotyping showed a significant increase in the expression of the B-cell activation markers CD80 in na?ve B cells (CD45+/CD19+/CD27-/IgD+), unswitched memory B cells (CD45+/CD19+/CD27+/IgD+), and switched memory B cells (CD45+/CD19+/CD27+/IgD-), and CD86 in na?ve and switched memory B cells.
In conclusion, the interaction of SDF-1 released from fibroblasts and CXCR4 expressed on ICC cells may be actively involved in ICC migration, and TNF-alpha may enhance ICC cell migration by increasing CXCR4 expression.
Within the chemokine system, strong upregulation of genes encoding proteins chemotactic for neutrophils, such as CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6, and CXCL8, and for activated/memory T lymphocytes, monocytes, and immature (i) DCs, e.g.
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is synthesized by a variety of cells including macrophages.
The expression of IL-19 protein in T cells and monocytes/macrophages was studied by flow cytometry.
The function of the neuronal proteins Shc and huntingtin in stem cells and neurons: pharmacologic exploitation for human brain diseases.
Hyperglycaemia also increased TRAP-induced platelet-leucocyte aggregation.
Domain and functional analysis of a novel platelet-endothelial cell surface protein, SCUBE1.
In the interstitium, KP-1 positive monocytes, L-26 positive B lymphocytes, UCHL-1 positive T lymphocytes and S-100 protein positive Langerhans-like cells were frequently found.
Insulin activated ERK1/2 in neurons 5-30 min after cell exposure to prooxidant.
Mutant SOD1 co-precipitated and co-localized with Hsp25 in neurons and astrocytes.
A SMAD-responsive luciferase reporter assay confirmed that porcine oocytes secreted factors that activate SMAD3 and SMAD1/5/8 in granulosa cells, but murine oocytes activated SMAD3 only.
