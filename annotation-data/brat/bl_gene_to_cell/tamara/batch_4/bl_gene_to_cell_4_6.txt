BMP2 significantly reduced the number of cells expressing microtubule-associated protein 2, a neuronal marker, and cells expressing nestin, a marker for undifferentiated neural precursors, but BMP2 increased the number of cells expressing S100-beta, an astrocytic marker.
Rac2 is a Rho GTPase that is expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin, including neutrophils and macrophages.
STAg-pretreatment decreased CD4(+) T cell, NK cell, CD11b(+) monocyte and CD11b(+)CD11c(+) dendritic cell numbers in the lamina propria and increased CD8(+) T cells in the intestinal epithelial compartment.
CaV1.4 expression was detectable in CD4(+) T cells, ex vivo TH1 cells, and TH17 cells, whereas Cav1.2 channels predominated in TH2 cells only.
In both healthy age groups, cyclooxygenase-1 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 were expressed in epithelial cells, endothelial cells and fibroblast-like connective tissue cells.
Monocyte LPS-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, TNF-alpha and IL-6 production in monocytes, and oxidative burst in monocytes and granulocytes were analyzed by means of flow cytometry.
Tumor monocyte adhesion to ICAM-1 was increased (P<0.001) after 21 days of COX-2 inhibition, and concomitant increases in tumor infiltrating monocytes (CD68+), lymphocytes (CD68- CCR5+, CD4+ and CD8+) and activated (CD25+) T cells were observed.
The brown adipocytes contain a protein thermogenin.
Myf-5, MyoD, myogenin, and MRF-4 induce cells to differentiate along a myogenic pathway, while MASH-1 promotes the differentiation of neuronal precursor cells.
At least three different subsets can be distinguished based on expression of the low-affinity Fc?RIII: CD14(++)CD16 -: classical monocytes, CD14(++)CD16(+) intermediate monocytes, and CD14(+)CD16 ++: non-classical monocytes.
MMP-1, MMP-9, and MMP-10 were mainly secreted by keratinocytes, whereas MMP-2, TIMP-1 and -2 by fibroblasts.
Nox1, Nox2, Nox4, and Nox5 are expressed in endothelium, vascular smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, or perivascular adipocytes.
Ultrafiltrate from septic patients significantly stimulated PBMC and monocyte TNF alpha release, but suppressed lymphocyte IL-2 and IL-6 production.
dNTP pool modulation dynamics by SAMHD1 protein in monocyte-derived macrophages.
The expression of CD14 and CD16 characterizes three monocyte subsets: CD14(++)CD16(-), CD14(++)CD16(+), and CD14((+))CD16(+) cells; the latter two are often denoted as 'proinflammatory' CD16(+) monocytes.
Tumoural cells expressed a mature T-cell phenotype CD4+/CD25+.
Moreover, SARS-CoV induced THP-1 cells to express CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL8/IL-8, CCL3/MIP-1alpha, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL4/MIP-1beta, and CCL5/RANTES, which attracted neutrophils, monocytes, and activated T cells in a chemotaxis assay.
Since NF-L and class II beta-tubulin are neuron-specific proteins, axotomy-induced alterations in the levels of retinal mRNAs encoding these proteins largely reflect corresponding changes in expression by retinal ganglion cell neurons.
We found that human fibroblasts were efficiently converted into hiHeps by using a combination of ATF5, PROX1, FOXA2, FOXA3, and HNF4A (albumin+/alpha-1 antitrypsin+ cells?=?27%, asialoglycoprotein receptor 1+ cells?=?22%).
To clarify interactions between epimorphin expression and hepatocyte behavior, epimorphin-expressing cells and proliferating hepatocytes were counted.
