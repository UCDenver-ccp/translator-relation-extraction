Here, we show that the mitochondrial proteins, LON protease 1 (LONP1) and prohibitin (PHB), are overexpressed in HtrA2(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells and HtrA2 knock-down HEK293T cells.
HAPI cells stain for the isolectin B4, OX-42, and GLUT5, which are markers for microglial cells, but the cells do not immunolabel with A2B5, a marker of cells in the oligodendroglial cell lineage, or with the astrocyte-specific marker, glial fibrillary aciidic protein (GFAP).
Leukocyte integrin Mac-1 regulates thrombosis via interaction with platelet GPIb?.
In contrast, the increased proliferation and differentiative capacity of p27(Kip1)-deficient T cells has no effect on the ability of STAT4/p27(Kip1)- or STAT6/p27(Kip1)-deficient CD4(+) cells to differentiate into Th1 or Th2 cells, respectively.
At protein level, keratinocytes produced 10 times higher amounts of VEGF-A than fibroblasts did.
Among the 48 proteins increased in Add2 knockout RBCs, only 11 were also increased in reticulocytes.
Additionally, a 102-kD phosphoprotein was observed in insulin-stimulated neuronal cells.
These iPS cells were characterized by immunofluorescence detection using of stem cell markers (SSEA4, Oct4, and Sox2).
Blood lymphocytes stimulated for 96 h with interleukin-2 (IL-2; 100 BRMP U/ml) (lymphokine-activated killer, LAK, cells) or granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating-factor (GM-CSF) (10 ng/ml) became cytotoxic for Daudi cells.
Overexpression of MKP-1 in fibrosarcoma cells and fibroblasts reduced proliferation, while expression of a phosphatase-resistant p38 protein (p38(N316)) enhanced proliferation of normal fibroblasts.
However, only CXCR4 and CCR5 were used to enter primary T cells and monocyte-derived macrophages, respectively.
Interleukin-HP1 (HP1)/IL-6 is a 25-30-kD protein produced by macrophages, fibroblasts, and certain T cell lines.
Coculture experiments showed that endothelial cells stimulated epithelial cells to release IL-6 and that epithelial cells enhanced release of IL-8 from endothelial cells.
For testing platelet-leukocyte-conjugates, antibodies against CD45, CD14 and CD41 were used.
CD44+/CD24+-Expressing Cervical Cancer Cells and Radioresistant Cervical Cancer Cells Exhibit Cancer Stem Cell Characteristics.
These stored product mite extracts induced secretion of interleukin-6, interleukin-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and granulocyte/monocyte colony stimulating factor.
The macrophage marker CD33 is expressed earlier than CD14 in macrophage maturation, whereas CD14 is expressed longer than CD33.
Expression of interleukin-8 receptors (CXCR1, CXCR2) and CD14 of circulating neutrophils and monocytes was assessed by flow cytometry.
We found that LAD2, a human mast cell line, and CD34(+) cell-derived primary mast cells express functional MrgX1 and MrgX2 but the immature human mast cell line HMC-1 does not.
SDF-1? and Cx37 proteins were detected in oocytes and granulosa cells from all the treatments.
