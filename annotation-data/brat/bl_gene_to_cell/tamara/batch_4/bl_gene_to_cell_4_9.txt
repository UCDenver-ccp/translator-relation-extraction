Colony formation was stimulated with granulocyte/monocyte-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), monocyte-CSF, or IL-3.
However, these cells do not yet display the full range of macrophage-specific properties such as receptors for macrophage-colony stimulating factor or the beta 2 integrin CD11b/CD18.
CD21(low) CD38(low) B cells as well as plasmablasts do not exhibit developmental changes.
T cells that cannot respond to TGF-beta escape control by CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells.
This cell line maintains epithelial cell morphology and expresses cytokeratins K8, K14, K18, K19.
CD4(+)IFN?(-)IL17(-)IL-22(+) T cells (Th22 cells), CD4(+)IFN?(-)IL-22(-)IL17(+) T cells (pure Th17 cells), CD4(+)IL17(+) T cells (Th17 cells), and CD4(+)IFN?(+) T cells (Th1 cells) in RA, osteoarthritis patients, and healthy controls were examined by flow cytometry.
These MDM expressed CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4, the major coreceptors for HIV macrophage- and T cell-tropic isolates, respectively.
CCR6-expressing cells, including CD45RO(+) memory T lymphocytes and fascin(+)-CD1a(+) immature dendritic cells, infiltrated close to the CCL20-expressing epithelial cells.
This factor was termed T-cell granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (T-cell GM-CSF).
During development, FGFR-1 and FGFR-2 drive oligodendrocytes and motor neuron specification.
Two reports in this issue of Cell Host & Microbe establish that Nod-like receptor proteins NOD1 and NOD2 regulate stem cell function.
The expression levels of COL2A1 and COL10A1 genes were higher in cultured chondrocytes than in situ chondrocytes; moreover, the expression of COL1A1 was almost undetectable on cultured chondrocytes; likewise, COL2 and SOX9 proteins were detected by immunofluorescence.
We show that Vav1 controls integrin-mediated adhesion of thymocytes and T cells to ECM proteins and ICAM1 following TCR stimulation.
Human hematopoietic cells exclusively expressed SSTR2, whereas mouse bone marrow cells expressed SSTR2 and SSTR4.
Macrophages as APC and the dendritic cell myth.
CD4(+)CCR5(+) T cells.
Interleukin-32 (IL-32) is a cytokine produced by T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes and epithelial cells.
The hematopoietic form of CD44 (CD44H) is the major CD44 protein present on normal human lymphocytes and monocytes.
Whereas about 40% of GAD67-immunopositive neurons and 30% of parvalbumin-immunopositive neurons (PV neurons) showed only weak signals.
CCL2 induced IL-4 in cultures of NKT cells cocultured with naive T cells, but IL-4 was not produced by these cells cultured separately with CCL2.
