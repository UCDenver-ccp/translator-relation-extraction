TLR2 stimulation activates neutrophils for MMP-9 release.
Edaravone can dose-dependently induce hUMSCs to differentiate into neuron-like cells that expressed the neuronal markers including NSE, nestin, and GFAP and synaptic makers such as SYN, PSD95, and GAP43.
MGCs were not produced from CD14(+)/CD16(+) monocytes or immature dendritic cells induced by granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL) 4 and only weakly produced from macrophage (M)-CSF- or GM-CSF-induced macrophages.
Following ischemia, SUR1-TRPM4 channels are transcriptionally upregulated in all cells of the neurovascular unit, including neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes and microvascular endothelial cells.
Using cultured human cells, we show here that APC up-regulates the angiogenic promoters matrix metalloproteinase-2 in skin fibroblasts and umbilical vein endothelial cells, vascular endothelial growth factor in keratinocytes and fibroblasts, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in fibroblasts.
EphA1, EphA3, ephrinA1, ephrinA2, EphB1, EphB4, ephrinB1, and ephrinB2 were detected in wild-type mouse corneal epithelial cells and keratocytes.
Immunohistochemistry showed that bone marrow stromal cells and megakaryocytes were the major cellular sources of BMP1 protein.
Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) protein, but not B-cell lymphoma protein-2 or B-cell lymphoma protein-xL, was significantly induced by hCG and LH.
IL-10 inhibits ICAM-1 expression on human Langerhans cells but not on keratinocytes, dermal endothelial cells or fibroblasts.
In particular, those that may regulate angiogenesis and promote the recruitment of monocytes, activated T cells (CXCL9 and CXCL10) and granulocytes (CXCL8).
Furthermore, CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells mediate potent inhibition of proliferation response of CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells, and anticytotoxic lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody could reduce the inhibitory activity of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells.
BDNF and NT-3 stimulation of neuronal survival and neurite extension was also demonstrated in dissociated neuronal cell cultures.
Mcl-1 is an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that plays a central role in cell survival of neutrophils and other cells.
We show that these horizontal cells co-express TrkA and NGF, unlike a subpopulation of amacrine cells that only expresses TrkA.
In the present study, the involvement of collagen 1 (Col1)-producing cells, CD45-positive/collagen-1-positive (CD45(+)/Col1(+)) cells originally named as fibrocytes via CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), a cognate receptor of CCL2/monocyte chemoattractant protein, was examined in diabetic conditions.
Marker gene expression was observed on the progeny of the transduced cells in conjunction with CD34 (progenitors), glycophorin A (erythrocytes), CD14 (monocytes), CD15 (granulocytes) and CD41 (megakaryocytes).
GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes expressed primarily RhoB and Rac1, while oligodendrocyte-like cells expressed RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42.
Differential regulation of M-CSF and IL-6 gene expression in monocytic cells.
S100-protein positive Langerhans cells and CD45-positive lymphocytes were scattered.
In cultured immature oocytes, treatment with BDNF or GDNF promoted total yields of metaphase II oocytes.
