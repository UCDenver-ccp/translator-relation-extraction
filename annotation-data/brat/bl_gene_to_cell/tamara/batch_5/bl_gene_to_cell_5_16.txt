Lymphocytes expressed bcl-2 intensely, but monocytes showed weaker bcl-2 expression, and neutrophils were essentially absent for bcl-2 expression.
Phenotypic differentiation was evaluated using NeuN, Iba1, APC, and S100beta as markers of neurons, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes, respectively.
Runx1-positive neurons lacked calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) expression, whereas Runx1-negative neurons expressed CGRP.
Npr2 is expressed in chondrocytes and osteoblasts.
EMAP-II is also chemotactic for monocytes and neutrophils.
There were no significant changes in circulating neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, or serum interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and C-reactive protein concentration over the 7 days following exercise.
Treatment of dendritic cells (DC), the human macrophage cell line THP-1, and monocytes (antigen-presenting cells, APC) with Pg.LPS inhibited APC maturation assessed by CD80 and CD86 expression, and inhibited chemokine (CCL3 and CCL5) production.
The mitogenic response of LRP1-null fibroblastic cells to lactoferrin is substantially reduced compared with that of cells expressing wild-type LRP1.
Interestingly, these FOXP3(+)/interleukin-17(+) cells originated mainly from effector T cells rather than regulatory T cells.
Monocytes (MO) cultured for > or =5 days with either macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) or granulocyte macrophage (GM)-CSF and IL-4 differentiated without concomitant proliferation into CD14+ macrophages (Mphi) or CD1a+ dendritic cells (DC), respectively.
These proteins associate with cellular damage following SCI and include components from neurons, oligodendrocytes and reactive astrocytes, that is, neurofilament proteins, glial fibrillary acidic protein, Tau and S100 calcium-binding protein ?.
TNF-alpha stimulated fibroblasts rescue CD4(+)CD7(-) T cells from apoptosis whereas unstimulated fibroblasts do not.
In addition, like monocytes, neutrophils respond to LPS/LBP complexes via CD14 by releasing TNF-alpha.
Activated NF-?B enhanced the degree of ATRA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells to macrophages, rather than granulocytes, as assessed by morphologic examination and expressions of differentiation markers such as CD11b, CD38, CD68, MMP9 and Btg2.
Among the various types of liver cells, PAI-1 protein and specific transcripts were present in HSCs and endothelial cells, and no major PAI-1 synthesis was detected in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes.
Immunization with irradiated MBP-reactive T cells (T cell vaccination) induces anti-idiotypic T cell responses that suppress circulating MBP-reactive T cells.
inv-GAL4 88B12 and Gyc?100B-GAL4 12G03 express in different subsets of A group neurons and CG12484-GAL4 91G04 is expressed in B neurons.
Nos1 was originally identified in neuronal cells and Nos3 in endothelial cells.
Reduced expression of CD28, CD4, CD86, CD93, NFATc1 (T-cells), TLR8, IL8, CCL18, DECTIN1 (macrophages), HLA-DOA and GPR183 (B-cells) at 90d PI suggests further deterioration of overall immune function.
The CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is predominantly expressed on inactivated naive T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and endothelial cells.
