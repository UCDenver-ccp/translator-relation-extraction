In the sham NG, HCN1, HCN3, and HCN4 were expressed in the A-fiber neurons; and HCN2, HCN3, and HCN4 were expressed in the C-fiber neurons.
The Tim-3 expression on CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, NK cells, DC cells increased when the Dok-3 gene knocked-out.
In cases of longer survival, neuronal necrosis and a loss of neurons were seen, and these changes were accompanied by proliferation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin-positive astrocytes and microglia which transformed into rod cells or lipid-laden macrophages.
Runx3 plays a role during the development of sensory neurons and T cells and regulates transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling in dendritic cells.
CD31/platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) is expressed on platelets, endothelial cells, myeloid cells, monocytes, and certain lymphocyte subsets.
CAAF1 was identified as a novel S100 protein produced by fetal epidermal keratinocytes, squamous epithelial cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
In PM and IBM, macrophages and cytotoxic T cells actively invading nonnecrotic muscle fibers expressed highest levels of CXCL10 and CCL2.
Tumour cells expressed vimentin, S100 protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein and variably neuron-specific enolase.
Immune indicators measured included CD4+?cells, CD8+?cells, CD4/CDC8+?ratio, CD3+?cells, NK cell activity, etc. Effects of PBIs on immune responses documented in individual papers were mixed and pooled analysis of CD4+?cells, CD4+/CD8+?ratio, CD3+?cells, NKCA, IgG, IgM and IL-2 showed modest effects.
Increased neuronal Rab5 immunoreactive endosomes do not colocalize with TDP-43 in motor neuron disease.
Cbl-b enhances Runx2 protein stability and augments osteocalcin promoter activity in osteoblastic cell lines.
The percentage of CD4?+?EBI3?+?T cells and CD19?+?EBI3?+?B cells was analysed using flow cytometry.
Glut2 and Glut4 were localized within odontoblasts and endothelial cells in normal control teeth.
Immunoreactivity was compared between control and AD groups for neuropathological hallmarks (amyloid-?, tau, ubiquitin), Purkinje cells (calbindin), microglia (IBA1, HLA-DR), astrocytes (GFAP) basement-membrane associated molecules (fibronectin, collagen IV), endothelial cells (CD31/PECAM-1) and mural cells (PDGFR?, ?SMA).
Motopsin and Itm2a co-localized in COS cells and in cultured neurons when transiently expressed in these cells.
These effects in epithelial cells are ameliorated by either increasing fibroblast Tiam1 or decreasing fibroblast osteopontin.
CD56(++)CD16(-) uNK, CD14(+) monocytes as well as cytotrophoblast (CTB) and stromal cells were tested separately.
CD44 is an adhesion molecule expressed by neutrophils, lymphocytes and epithelial cells.
Neither IL-3 nor macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) induced IL-6 production in microglia.
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) recruits and primes neutrophilic granulocytes.
