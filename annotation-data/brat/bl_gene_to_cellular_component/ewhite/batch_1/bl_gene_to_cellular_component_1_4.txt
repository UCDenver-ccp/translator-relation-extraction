Proteins reported to interact with SERCA2 from the cytosolic domain involve the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, the insulin receptor substrates IRS1/2, the EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein S100A1 and acylphosphatase.
These activities of p53 reflect enhanced integrin and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) trafficking, which depends on Rab-coupling protein (RCP) and results in constitutive activation of EGFR/integrin signaling.
Exosome biogenesis was regulated by VP40 in transfected cells by increasing levels of ESCRT-II proteins EAP20 and EAP45, and exosomal marker proteins CD63 and Alix.
The forkhead transcription factor FOXK2 acts as a chromatin targeting factor for the BAP1-containing histone deubiquitinase complex.
Utilizing quantitative SILAC-based secretome analysis, we identified the insulin growth factor binding protein IGFBP3 as the key mediating factor, demonstrating that elevated FIZ1 levels promote increased IGFBP3 expression and secretion and a concurrent increased sensitivity to IGF1 signaling, while antibody-based neutralization of IGFBP3 abrogates the FIZ1-induced growth advantage.
In contrast, inhibition of p38 MAPK led to enhanced Bax and Bak activation and mitochondrial cell death.
Preclinical studies of anti-EGFR anti-HER2 antibodies, and kinase inhibitors that inhibit EGFR, both EGFR and HER2, or all 4 family members show potential for clinical radiosensitization.
The interactions between TGF-Smad and BMP-MAPK were also studied.
The genes glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) (chromosome 1p13.3) and glutathione S-transferase T1 (GSTT1) (22q11.2) code for cytosolic enzymes glutathione S-transferase (GST)-mu and GST-theta, respectively, which are involved in phase 2 metabolism.
API2 was localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and MALT1 and API2-MALT1 in the cytoplasm only.
Muscarinic receptor stimulation resulted in transient co-localization of Pyk2 and Src at the cell periphery, and expression of kinase dead (KD) Pyk2 and Src, but not Pyk2 and KD Src, resulted in GFP-TASK1 internalization.
Western blot assay was used to measure levels of Angptl3, integrin ?3?1, integrin-linked kinase (ILK), p53, caspase 3, and phosphorylation of integrin ?1.
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, termed MAPK modules, channel extracellular signals into specific cellular responses.
However, intracellular localization of ?1-syntrophin and other Schwann cell proteins such as ezrin and dystrophin-related protein 2 (DRP2) and the localization of the axonal node of Ranvier-associated protein Caspr1/paranodin were not affected in MAP1B null mice.
TMC caused DNA double-strand breaks, and enhanced expression of caspase-3 and -9, (poly ADP-ribose) polymerase, cytochrome c, calpain-1 and -2, phosphorylation of histone H2AX, phosphorylation of checkpoint kinases 2, p53, BCL2-antagonist/killer and BCL2-associated ? protein, while reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential, and expression of B-cell lymphoma-2.
The KLF9-suppressed mRNAs encode protein participants in: aldehyde metabolism (AKR7A2, ALDH1A1); regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility (e.g., ANK3, ITGB8); cellular detoxification (SULT1A1, ABCC4); cellular signaling (e.g., ACBD3, FZD5, RAB25, CALB1); and transcriptional regulation (PAX2, STAT1).
Specific absorption of this activity by anti-group II PLA2 (PLA2-II) antibody indicated that the PLA2 activity in the pleural exudate was PLA2-II.
The downregulation of intracellular signaling cascades, including EGFR, Akt, Erk and Stat3, was also observed.
The addition of TGF-beta1 led to increased phosphorylation of R-Smads and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and p38 MAP kinase pathways.
Furthermore, several differentially expressed proteins, including heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1, calnexin, and integrin-linked kinase, were validated by western blotting.
