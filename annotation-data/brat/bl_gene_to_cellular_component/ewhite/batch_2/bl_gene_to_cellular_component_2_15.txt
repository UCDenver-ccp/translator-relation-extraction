The beta-tail domain (betaTD) regulates physiologic ligand binding to integrin CD11b/CD18.
The antibody cross-reacted with GST-Mce1F, but not with the other recombinant GST-Mce1 fusion proteins or free GST.
Additionally, quercetin altered the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and reduced MMP2, MMP9, CXCR4, integrin ?1, and integrin ?5 expression.
Here we present genome-wide remodeller-nucleosome interaction profiles for the chromatin remodellers Chd1, Chd2, Chd4, Chd6, Chd8, Chd9, Brg1 and Ep400 in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.
Ataxin-7 and Non-stop coordinate SCAR protein levels, subcellular localization, and actin cytoskeleton organization.
MAP kinase activation was monitored by Western blot using a phosphospecific p44/p42 MAP kinase antibody.
Molecular and cellular studies demonstrated that HMFRR significantly downregulated the expressions of cell adhesion-related and invasion-related molecules such as integrin ?1, EGFR, COX-2, MMP-2, and MMP-9 proteins.
Structurally diverse ion transport proteins anchor the spectrin-actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane by binding directly to linker proteins of the ankyrin and protein 4.1 families.
To study Rab21 protein expression in Caco-2 cells, polyclonal antibodies were raised against GST-Rab21 fusion protein and characterised.
EP4 mediated barrier-protective effects of PGA2 by activating Rap1/Rac1 GTPase and protein kinase A targets at cell adhesions and cytoskeleton: VE-cadherin, p120-catenin, ZO-1, cortactin, and VASP.
Kindlin-1 is an integrin tail binding protein that controls integrin activation.
Loss of SLIT2/ROBO1 signaling increases SNAI1 in the nucleus.
Cat, Gpx7, Gad1, Hspa12A, Foxn1, adenosine A1 receptor, Ca(2+) adaptor and homeostasis proteins, Cacnb4, Atp2b2, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene members, intracellular trafficking protein, Grasp and suppressor of cytokine signaling (Socs3)].
Differentially abundant mitochondrial 39S ribosomal protein L50, mTERF domain-containing protein 1, Chitinase-3 like 2 protein, and ubiquinone biosynthesis protein COQ9 have been identified in cells undergoing apoptosis.
ACAP4 protein cooperates with Grb2 protein to orchestrate epidermal growth factor-stimulated integrin ?1 recycling in cell migration.
Chemokine-induced Zap70 kinase-mediated dissociation of the Vav1-talin complex activates alpha4beta1 integrin for T cell adhesion.
Protein disulfide isomerase A3, integrase interactor 1 protein, growth inhibitory protein, glutathione S-transferase P, and vav proto-oncogene were down-regulated, whereas heat shock 60 kDa protein 1, Ku70 binding protein, alpha enolase, 26S proteasome subunit were up-regulated.
Rab7, a late endosomal protein, was upregulated and CD1d molecules accumulated in the Rab7(+) late endosomal compartment.
While G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest class of membrane proteins, structures and endogenous ligands of a large portion of GPCRs remain unknown.
These proteins, whose interactions with CASK are reviewed here, include the Parkinson's disease molecule parkin, the adhesion molecule neurexin, syndecans, calcium channel proteins, the cytoplasmic adaptor protein Mint1, Veli/mLIN-7/MALS, SAP97, caskin and CIP98, transcription factor Tbr-1, and nucleosome assembly protein CINAP.
