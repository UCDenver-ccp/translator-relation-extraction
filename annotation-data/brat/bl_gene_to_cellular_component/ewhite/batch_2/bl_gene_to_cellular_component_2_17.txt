Among other proteins, the membrane bound alkaline phosphatase (HvALP), and a novel phosphatase, were identified as Cry1Ac binding proteins.
Ste20, which phosphorylates Ste11 to initiate signaling, is activated by binding to Cdc42 GTPase (membrane anchored via its C-terminal geranylgeranylation). Less clear is how activated and membrane-localized Ste20 contacts Ste11 to trigger invasive growth signaling, which also requires Ste7 and the MAPK Kss1, but not Ste5.
LPL binds apolipoprotein E (apoE) lipoprotein particles and a major apoE receptor, low density lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP).
Further, E2 decreased Hcy-induced apoptotic death by upregulating the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, decreasing cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and attenuating apoptotic cascade activation (Bax, caspase-9, and caspase-3).
Nucleosome structural changes induced by binding of non-histone chromosomal proteins HMGN1 and HMGN2.
TGF-beta1 acts through the TGF-beta type I and type II receptors to activate intracellular mediators, such as Smad proteins, the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway.
Highly downregulated proteins included PAI-2, tropomyosins 9213, 9121 and 9122, keratin 5, calnexin, 14-3-3 beta and eta, nucleoside diphosphate kinase A, Rho GDIs, hsp60, hnRNPs H and C2, alpha-enolase, eIF-4D, thioredoxin, annexins III and V, moesin, nucleolar protein B23, GST pi and PCNA/cyclin.
The purified insulin receptor kinase catalyzed the phosphorylation of native tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs; MAP2, tau) on tyrosine residues.
hBD-2 induced phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and Akt, while hBD-3 induced phosphorylation of inhibitory ?B kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Akt in CD3/28-stimulated T cells.
Curcumin suppressed not only TGF-beta(1)-induced Smad2 phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, but also the nuclear accumulation of receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smad), Smad2 and Smad3.
Inhibitory Smads (I-Smads) repress TGF-beta signaling mainly by interacting with activated TGF-beta receptors.
Down-regulation of nucleosomal binding protein HMGN1 expression during embryogenesis modulates Sox9 expression in chondrocytes.
DISC1 interacts by yeast two-hybrid, mammalian two-hybrid, and co-immunoprecipitation assays with multiple proteins of the centrosome and cytoskeletal system, including MIPT3, MAP1A and NUDEL; proteins which localize receptors to membranes, including alpha-actinin2 and beta4-spectrin; and proteins which transduce signals from membrane receptors, including ATF4 and ATF5.
Here we show that the major mismatch-binding proteins MSH2 and MSH6, forming the MutSalpha complex, are phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C and casein kinase II, but not by protein kinase A. Phosphorylation of MSH2 and MSH6 was also found within the cell, with MSH6 being more extensively phosphorylated than MSH2.
In THP1 cells, Ox-LDL induced time-dependent secretory IL-1? and IRAK1 activity; IRAK4, IRAK3, and CD36 protein expression; PKC?-JNK1 phosphorylation; and AP-1 activation.
Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (p44/p42 ERK) activity and expressions of cell-cycle proteins (cyclin D(1), CDK4, pRB and p27(Kip1)) were determined by Western blotting.
Thus, nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of ICAP1 influences both integrin activation and KRIT1 localization, presumably impacting nuclear functions of KRIT1.
Furthermore we have shown CHIP-Smad interaction using the (35)S-labeled CHIP protein, which can interact with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Smad1 and GST-Smad4 in an in vitro protein-binding assay.
Our data show that degradation of all three proteins is dependent on the ubiquitin-proteasome system involving the ubiquitin-protein ligase complex Der3/Hrd1p-Hrd3p, the ubiquitin conjugating enzymes Ubc1p and Ubc7p, as well as the AAA-ATPase complex Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 and the 26S proteasome.
The hemodynamics, infarct size, apoptosis, phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt), phosphorylated extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3? (GSK3?), Bcl-2, phosphorylated Bad, and Bax were determined.
