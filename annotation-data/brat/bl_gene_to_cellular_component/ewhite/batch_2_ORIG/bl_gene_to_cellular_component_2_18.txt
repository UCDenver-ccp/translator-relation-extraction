Strikingly, HMGB1 rapidly increased integrin affinity and induced integrin polarization.
The subcellular location and expression levels during infection of the ribosomal proteins RPS3a, RPL7, RPL18, RPL18a plus GAPDH were determined.
cell motility, membrane trafficking, ERK signaling, and matrix invasion; three (KIF14, KIFC3, STARD9/KIF16A) have kinesin motor domains; and five (EPLIN, KIF14, BUB1, ODF2/cenexin, RHAMM) are important for cell division.
RAD6 promotes homologous recombination repair by activating the autophagy-mediated degradation of heterochromatin protein HP1.
Effects on p53 and Hsp27 implicate function of protein kinase C, the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway, and the cytoskeleton.
The inhibitory Smad (I-Smad) Smad6 was previously shown to play an important role in TGF-beta1-induced negative regulation of Interleukin-1/Toll-like receptor (IL-1R/TLR) signaling through binding to Pellino-1, an adaptor protein of interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 1(IRAK1).
Downregulation of ATG7, ATG5 or BECN1 by RNAi significantly decreases caspase-3 activation, lysosomal permeabilization and cell death.
CR-1 binds to cell surface Glypican-1 to activate Erk1/2 MAPK and Akt pathways leading to cell proliferation.
CT induced increase of intracellular phosphorylation of Tyr(402) Pyk2 and increase of dephosphorylation at Tyr(527) of Src and Pyk2/Src colocalization in the central region of OCs.
The primary intracellular mediators of TGF-beta signaling are the Smad proteins.
Western blotting was carried out for the detection of phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR), phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-p38 MAPK) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase (p-ERK).
Role of beta7 integrin and the chemokine/chemokine receptor pair CCL25/CCR9 in modeled TNF-dependent Crohn's disease.
The phosphorylation status of extracellular signal related kinase (ERK1/2) and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) was studied by western blotting.
Axotrophin/MARCH7 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and ubiquitinates tau protein in vitro impairing microtubule binding.
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) became phosphorylated in response to HOCl-LDL alone.
Among the list of genes expressed in type 1 cells are cadherins (CDH3), tight junction proteins (CLDN4), receptors (DDR1), integrins (ITGB4), cell adhesion molecules (EpCAM/TACSTD1), cell surface proteins (CD133/PROM1, ANXA3, and CD24), and a gene encoding the multidrug resistance protein MRP4/ABCC4.
These include alpha V beta 3 (CD51/CD61, vitronectin receptor), CD36 (thrombospondin receptor), macrophage class A scavenger receptor, phosphatidylserine translocated to the outer leaflet of apoptotic cell membranes, and CD14 (LPS-binding protein).
Furthermore, EGF stimulated both intracellular protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase MEK1/2 activities.
Expressions of Bcl-2, Bax proteins and phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated protein kinases (ERKs, p42/p44) were analyzed via Western blot.
Serine/threonine kinases that are known to phosphorylate the Smad linker region include mitogen-activated protein kinases, extracellular-signal regulated kinase, Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 kinase, the tyrosine kinase Src, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, cyclin-dependent kinases, rho-associated protein kinase, calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase and glycogen synthase kinase-3.
