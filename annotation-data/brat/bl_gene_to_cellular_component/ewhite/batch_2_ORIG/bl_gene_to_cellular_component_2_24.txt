Immunohistochemistry for mitochondria, gross cystic disease fluid protein 15, chromogranin, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, androgen receptor, HER2/Neu, cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 14, epithelial membrane antigen, and differentiation cluster 68 was performed.
It attenuated FMLP-induced increase of phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A (cPLA2), p21-activated kinase (PAK), Akt, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).
The mechanism of p53 inactivity in p21-null cells is linked to a p53 protein equilibrium shift from chromatin into cytosolic fractions and complementation of the p21 gene into p21-null cells restores the nuclear localization of p53.
BMP-induced SMAD signaling and BMPR1A-mediated growth suppression were reversed with DN BMPR1A transfection.
Calpain-1, Src and ?-spectrin protein expression were analyzed by Western blot.
Along with the reduction in p27(Kip1) protein, PAX3-FKHR-expressing cells exhibited elevated expression of F-box Skp2 protein, a substrate-specific component of SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F box protein) ligase involved in the cell cycle-dependent control of p27(Kip1) ubiquitination and 26 S proteasome dependent degradation.
Nectin furthermore induces activation of Cdc42 and Rac small G proteins through c-Src, which eventually regulates formation of the cadherin-based adherens junctions through reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, gene expression through activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, and cell polarization through cell polarity proteins.
Furthermore, fisetin markedly attenuated the translocation of cytochrome c protein from the mitochondria to the cytosol; decreased the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins including Bax, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9 and p53; and prevented the decline of anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2.
TCR signaling acts via Rac to reduce phosphorylation of ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins, which are required for uropod formation, and to increase stathmin phosphorylation, which regulates microtubule stability.
A fraction of cytosolic Ku70 also binds to cytosolic Ku80, Ku70's binding partner in the nucleus.
Over-expression of PIP5KIgamma improved cell survival and inhibited secretion with accumulation of endocytic vacuoles containing F-actin, PIP(2), transferrin receptor, caveolin 1, Arf6 and the insulin granule membrane protein phogrin but not insulin.
It has been shown that phosphorylation of PCNA at Tyr-211 by the EGF receptor (EGFR) protects PCNA from polyubiquitylation and degradation, whereas blocking phosphorylation induces ubiquitylation-mediated degradation of the chromatin-bound, but not the -unbound, PCNA, and suppresses cell proliferation.
Furthermore, AGT, MMP3, HPSE and GAPDH were found to be directly related to BMP, MAPK, Wnt, SMAD and tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 11 (TNFSF11) families.
Expression in Jurkat cells of the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (MAPK p38), a signal transduction protein that is activated by osmotic stress, was determined by immunoblotting with anti-MAPK p38 antibodies.
This in turn up-regulates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling to mediate Src activation, leading to E-cadherin ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation.
Therefore SIP1 does not inhibit BMP signaling by binding to Smad proteins.
MG triggered mitochondrial cytochrome c release in the cytosol and up-regulated Bax while down-regulated anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.
Membrane-bound trafficking regulates nuclear transport of integral epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB-2.
Smad proteins are intracellular mediators of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and related cytokines.
NHERF1/EBP50 (Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulating factor 1; ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) binding phosphoprotein of 50 kDa) is a PDZ domain-containing protein with physiological localization at the plasma membrane.
