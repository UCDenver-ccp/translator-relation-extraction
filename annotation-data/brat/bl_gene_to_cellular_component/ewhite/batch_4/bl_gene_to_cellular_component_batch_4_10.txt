The effect of the regulation of MMP2 on mitochondrial dysfunction and the subcellular localization of the molecular chaperone important for mitochondrial integrity (Hsp60) and gap junction protein connexin 43 were investigated in retinal endothelial cells.
When applied to membrane proteins as the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family, both ligand-induced conformational changes of the receptor can be followed as well as interactions with effectors (e.g., G-proteins).
SIRT1 has a diffuse nuclear localization but is recruited to the PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) after PML upregulation.
The TNF-Î±, TNF receptor 1, Fas ligand, Fas receptor, FADD, and activated caspase-3 and 8 protein levels (Fas pathway) and the Bax, Bak, Bax/Bcl-2, Bak/Bcl-xL, cytosolic cytochrome c, and activated caspase-3 and nine protein levels (mitochondria pathway) were increased in the FIMS group compared with those in the CON group.
The 65-kD microtubule-associated protein (MAP65) family is a family of plant microtubule-bundling proteins.
The ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin) proteins are a class of highly homologous proteins involved in linking the plasma membrane to the cortical actin cytoskeleton.
Tyr701-phosphorylated STAT1 (P-STAT1) was measured by intracellular flow cytometry and IFN-stimulated gene expression was measured by Real Time PCR.
HS increased the integrin-paxillin-focal adhesion kinase interaction, whereas targeted inhibition of focal adhesion kinase activity abolished the integrin-paxillin association and resulted in an increase in cell death.
Our observations indicate that SEL-2/neurobeachin/LRBA is involved in endosomal traffic and may be involved in efficient delivery of cell surface proteins to the lysosome.
Biglycan and EGF treatment protracted extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) and Akt phosphorylation, albeit to different extents.
Fluorescence microscopy and alkaline phosphatase localization approaches using Nuc2-GFP and Nuc2-PhoA fusions, respectively, demonstrated that Nuc2 is membrane bound with the C-terminus facing the extracellular environment, indicating it is a signal-anchored Type II membrane protein.
We have previously shown that another type I receptor, ALK1 (ACVRL1), can also mediate TGF-beta signals via BMP-activated Smads in vascular endothelial cells (ECs).
The increased mobility of the beta-adrenergic-receptor proteins after alkaline phosphatase treatment of membranes was again inhibited by 20 mM-phosphate.
[Diabetes caused by anti-insulin receptor antibody: characterization of insulin receptor antibody (author's transl)].
Administration of beta-oestradiol to virgin and lactating glands caused about 1.4-4-fold increase in the level of alpha2 integrin, indicating that upregulation of integrin during pregnancy may be due to oestrogen and as the oestrogen level falls during lactating phase, downregulation of alpha2beta1 integrin occurs.
This study describes a novel function for CHL1 in potentiating integrin-dependent cell migration toward extracellular matrix proteins.
GH also binds to the growth hormone binding protein (GHBP) which is the soluble form of GHR extracellular domain existing in circulation.
Three sirtuins, SIRT3, SIRT4 and SIRT5, are located in the mitochondria, dynamic organelles that function as the primary site of oxidative metabolism and play crucial roles in apoptosis and intracellular signaling.
Antibodies directed against the activated, phosphorylated forms of proteins were used when appropriate (SMAD1/5/8, SMAD2/3).
We found Mn could increase the HMGB1 mRNA level and its cytosolic translocation and dysregulate autophagy, and Mn-induced alpha-synuclein overexpression interfered with the interaction of HMGB1 and Beclin1, to subsequently promote Beclin1 binding to Bcl2.
