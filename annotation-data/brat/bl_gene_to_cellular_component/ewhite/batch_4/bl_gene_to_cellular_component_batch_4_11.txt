RPS6 can be phosphorylated by p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (RSK) proteins.
Treatment with FGF23 activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (Akt) pathways in PBMCm, demonstrating functional FGFR signaling in these cells.
The CaR also appears to interact with additional proteins common to other G protein-coupled receptors such as arrestins, G protein receptor kinases, protein kinase C, caveolin and proteins in the ubiquitination pathway.
Protein kinase C association with the retinal cytoskeleton and phosphorylation of vimentin.
Functional analysis of the predictor genes showed that they play a role in immune responses to bacteria (PTN, OLFM4 and LILRA2), autophagy and endocytocis processes (ATG16L1, DNAJC6, VPS26B, RABGEF1, ITSN1 and TMEM127) and glucocorticoid receptor degradation (STS and MMD2).
GST-GST and ARSBD-ARSBD between the fusion molecules.
p38 MAP kinase phosphorylates the nuclear kinase mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1).
Surprisingly, we found that expression of SrcMF or Src251 resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK on Tyr(407), Tyr(576), Tyr(577), and Tyr(861), which are considered to be Src kinase substrates.
CypA knockdown led to reductions in total and phosphorylated MAPK kinases, including Akt, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and JNK, in HEC-1-B/TAX cells.
Upon perception of the pheromone signal Kpp2 is phosphorylated by the MAPK kinase Fuz7.
Therefore, cytoplasmic localization of HMGA1 proteins in malignant tissues is a novel mechanism of inactivation of p53 apoptotic function.
Synaptic proteins, the metal-binding protein metallothionein, and the Akt/GSK3 and ERK/MAPK cellular signaling pathways were also altered.
Lysophosphatidic acid stimulates binding of EGF receptor to a GST fusion protein containing the c-Src SH2 domain, and this too is blocked by Csk expression.
GRB2 is the only known adaptor protein binding to Tyr1096.
KGFR and EGFR appear to also contribute to the cell differentiation process.
The MAPK phosphorylation status and Bcl2/Bax expression levels were evaluated after treatment with various antioxidants.
Depletion of LATS2 or Ajuba impaired centrosomal accumulation of gamma-tubulin and spindle formation at the onset of mitosis, suggesting that the LATS2-Ajuba complex regulates organization of the spindle apparatus through recruitment of gamma-tubulin to the centrosome.
During rhodopsin progression, ASAP1 serves as an activation platform that brings together the proteins necessary for transport to the cilia, including the Rab11a-Rabin8-Rab8 complex involved in ciliogenesis.
RBQ3, also known as RBBP5 (RB-binding protein 5), was an RB-binding protein.
LTA and PepG markedly increased pulmonary EC permeability and activated p38 and ERK1/2 MAP kinases, NF-?B, and Rho/Rho kinase signaling.
