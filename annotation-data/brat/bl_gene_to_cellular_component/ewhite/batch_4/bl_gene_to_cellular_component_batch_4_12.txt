The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is a cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin-protein ligase that targets cyclin B, securin and other destruction box containing proteins for proteolysis.
Unlike wild-type Dab1 protein, p64/60 is not phosphorylated by Fyn kinase and localizes considerably to the nucleus.
By using phosphorylation-deficient and phosphorylation-mimic mutants, we identify BCR-ABL induced Beclin-1 phosphorylation as a crucial mechanism for Beclin-1 complex formation: Interaction analyses exhibit diminished binding of the positive autophagy regulators UVRAG, VPS15, ATG14 and VPS34 and enhanced binding of the negative regulator Rubicon to BCR-ABL-phosphorylated Beclin-1.
GGT5 and GGT1 are cell surface enzymes.
Preincubation of cells with chemical inhibitors of protein kinase A, c-Src, and EGFR kinase abolished the EP2-induced activation of EGFR and ERK1/2.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed that particulate matter (PM)-treated HAEC increased mRNA levels of xenobiotic response enzymes CYP1A1, ALDH1A3, and TIPARP and cellular stress response transcription factor ATF3. Inflammatory response genes included E-selectin, PTGS2, CXCL-2 (MIP-2?), and CCL-2 (MCP-1).
And isotrifoliol significantly suppressed phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).
Phospho-p38 MAPK protein but not total p38 MAPK was higher in HG compared with LG+M.
Here, we identify an unprecedented membrane sialidase mechanism initiated by nerve growth factor (NGF) binding to TrkA to potentiate GPCR-signaling via membrane Galphai subunit proteins and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activation to induce Neu1 sialidase activation in live primary neurons and TrkA- and TrkB-expressing cell lines.
The activity of Smad1 in the BMP pathway and Smad2/3 in the TGFbeta pathway is restricted by pathway cross-talk and feedback through protein kinases, including MAPK, CDK2/4, p38MAPK, JNK, and others.
In IL-1?-treated chondrocytes, COS downregulated the expression of Bax and caspase-3 but upregulated the expression of Bcl-2 by inhibiting the phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).
TGF-beta1 and EGF stimulate EMT.
Gene transcription patterns associated with activation of oncogenes Myc, c-Src, beta-catenin, E2F3, H-Ras, HER2, EGFR, MEK, Raf, MAPK, Akt, and cyclin D1, as well as of the cell cycle and of androgen signaling have been generated in previous studies using experimental models.
The receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMPs) are a family of membrane proteins that interact with some G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to regulate their function.
Dual phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and phosphorylation of its substrate activating transcription factor-2 were detected at ionomycin concentrations that prime or activate the PMN oxidase, while dual phosphorylation of p42/44 MAP kinase and phosphorylation of its substrate Elk-1 were elicited at 0.2-2 microM.
Eph receptor tyrosine kinases EphB2 and EphB3, and ephrin-B1 ligand play a critical role in regulating small intestinal epithelial cell migration.
However, antibodies to either TJ protein co-immunoprecipitated caveolin-1, a CH-binding protein.
Incretin hormone receptors: GLP1R and GIPR together with the glucagon receptor GCGR regulate food intake and insulin and glucose secretion.
Cell proliferation, migration, cell cycle, apoptosis, cocultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells tube formation, VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and neuropilin 1 (Nrp1) receptor expression, VEGF- and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) concentration, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38MAPK) signaling pathway studies were measured.
Molecules enriched in this membrane include G protein-coupled receptors, heterotrimeric GTP binding proteins, IP3 receptor-like protein, Ca2+ ATPase, eNOS, and several PKC isoforms.
