These findings imply that p62 accumulation in the nucleus in response to autophagy inhibition promotes proteasome-mediated CHK1 and RAD51 protein instability.
PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) is a negative regulator of the hepatic LDL receptor, and clinical studies with PCSK9-inhibiting antibodies have demonstrated strong LDL-c-lowering effects.
There was a significant association between antibodies to p54 protein and vWF (p=0.027) and between antibodies to p33 protein and PAI:Ag concentration (p=0.019).
When the centrosome overduplication was blocked by enforced expression of p21Waf1/Cip1, the radiation-induced lethality was drastically rescued.
The microtubule-associated protein (MAP)/microtubule affinity regulating kinase (MARK)/Par-1 phosphorylates microtubule-associated proteins tau, MAP2, and MAP4 and is involved in the regulation of microtubule-based transport.
Immunoreactive GTP-binding proteins, G alpha q and G alpha 11, and phospholipase-C beta 3 isoforms were present in myometrial membranes.
Upon cell stress, Bif-1 translocated to mitochondria to bind prohibitin-2, resulting in the disruption of prohibitin complex and proteolytic inactivation of the inner membrane fusion protein OPA1.
HMGB1 exhibits a dual role in pancreatic cancer; when intracellular, it acts as an anti-tumor protein stabilizing the genome, whereas extracellular HMGB1 behaves as a pro-tumor protein with cytokine, chemokine and growth factor functions.
Immunocytochemical analysis with ARP8-specific monoclonal antibodies revealed that ARP8 protein is localized to the nucleolus in interphase cells and dispersed in the cytoplasm in mitotic cells.
RNA binding protein Musashi-1 directly targets Msi2 and Erh during early testis germ cell development and interacts with IPO5 upon translocation to the nucleus.
The Ca2+ uptake enhancing effect of the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 is due to the inhibition of p38 MAPK and not to a direct mitochondrial action.
Identification of novel bifunctional calmodulin-binding and microtubule-stabilizing motifs in STOP proteins.
NOA36 protein contains a highly conserved nucleolar localization signal capable of directing functional proteins to the nucleolus, in mammalian cells.
Characterization of a major protein in GLUT4 vesicles.
The alteration of cell polarity, morphogenesis, protein reabsorption and the down-regulation of the tight junction molecule ZO-1, of the sodium transporter NHE3, of the glucose transporter GLUT-2 and of the endocytic receptor megalin all induced by septic plasma were significantly reduced by resin adsorption.
Several intracellular signals elicited by ET-1 via ET receptors and even Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) contributed to the up-regulation of CTGF, including ERK activation and induction of the AP-1 components c-fos and c-jun, as also evaluated by ChIP analysis.
Moreover, β1 integrin-deficient cells were more sensitive to erufosine-treatment compared to β1 integrin proficient cells suggesting a role of β1 integrins for matrix-mediated death resistance.
The fibroblast-like cells producing MMP-2 have the machinery for activin reception, expressing both type I and type II activin receptors and Smad proteins.
Finally, a pronounced interaction of Sec23/Sec24 with sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein and SREBP-1c was noted, thereby permitting the transfer of the transcription factor SREBP-1c to the nucleus for the activation of genes involved in lipid metabolism.
The synaptic vesicle protein CSP alpha prevents presynaptic degeneration.
