Regulation of Ste7 ubiquitination by Ste11 phosphorylation and the Skp1-Cullin-F-box complex.
Here, we conclude that inhibiting ANXA7 GTPase activity promotes the interaction of ANXA7 and XRN2 in nucleus, which regulates the read-through transcription of MROH7-TTC4, and TIA1 is responsible for the process of MROH7-TTC4 that inhibits apoptosis through MROH7 and TTC4.
Arrestins are proteins that arrest the activity of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
HASM cells were cultured and treated with TGF-beta and Th2 cytokines IL-4 or IL-13.
The alternative SDF-1 (stromal cell derived factor-1) receptor, CXCR7, has been suggested to act as either a scavenger of extracellular SDF-1 or a modulator of the primary SDF-1 receptor, CXCR4.
Antibodies directed against the epithelial plasma membrane protein E-cadherin, the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-1, and the lysosomal matrix protease cathepsin-D were used.
Rice Pti1a negatively regulates RAR1-dependent defense responses.
AVP treatment appeared to transactivate EGF-R by inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of the Ca(2+)/protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Pyk2, leading to Pyk2/c-Src association and c-Src activation.
We show that active focal adhesion kinase (FAK), an established marker of integrin-ECM downstream signalling, localizes with active integrins on endosomes.
BetaKlotho physically interacts with FGF receptors 1c and 4, thereby increasing the ability of these FGF receptors to bind FGF21 and activate the MAP kinase cascade.
Inhibition of cholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase in vitro by butyrophenone neuroleptics.
Chemokines, eg IL-8 and chemokine receptors such as CXCR4 and 7, promote inflammation and metastasis.
The activities of catalase (Cat), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), glutathione transferase (GST), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PD) were studied in tissue and hemolymph of susceptible (S) (EgBS(2)) and resistant (R) (EgBR(2)) Biomphalaria alexandrina snails.
EGF treatment also resulted in phosphorylation of filamin A (FLNa), which binds and inactivates ?1 integrins.
Our results indicate that Cre-expression itself in Sertoli cells already has led to oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation (4-HNE lysine adducts), inducing PPAR?/?, peroxisome proliferation and alterations of peroxisome biogenesis (PEX5, PEX13 and PEX14) as well as metabolic proteins (ABCD1, ABCD3, MFP1, thiolase B, catalase).
Overexpression of TTP decreased Pim-1 expression and p21 and p27 phosphorylation and inhibited cell growth.
Because inflammatory stimuli that activate integrin-mediated adhesion in human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and monocytes cause phosphorylation of the actin-bundling protein L-plastin, we tested whether L-plastin phosphorylation was involved in integrin activation.
SAA1 and SAA2 are inducible by inflammatory cytokines, whereas SAA4 is constitutively produced.
E-cadherin and claudin-7 marked mainly the basolateral membrane, while claudin-2, ZO-1, and occludin resided in the apical membrane.
Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) targets the LDL-receptor (LDLR) and results in increased LDL levels.
