MMP may cleave membrane-bound precursor proteins and release epidermal growth factor-like ligands that subsequently bind to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).
Addition of microtubule proteins prepared by cycles of assembly and disassembly resulted in phosphorylation of histone, phosphorylation of tubulin and the microtubule-associated proteins, and phosphorylation of neurofilament subunits.
This study revealed the intervention of Hsp27 in upstream of both ASK1/p38 apoptotic signaling and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt survival signaling.
STAT1 cannot compensate in the absence of STAT3 and, in fact, much of STAT1 binding to chromatin is STAT3 dependent.
The cell surface expression of CD23, CD21, ICAM-1 and LFA-1 was monitored on transfected cells.
The interaction of PTPIP51 with PTP1B suggests a regulatory function of PTPIP51 in insulin receptor signal transduction.
In addition, IGF-1 may function through the MAPK/p38 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways to regulate Cx43 expression.
DSS also up-regulated the expression of inflammation-related genes: pro-inflammatory and chemotactic cytokines, including IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, CCL2, CCL4, CCL7, CCL24, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5, CXCL9 and CXCL10, and their receptors CCR3 and CCR7, and other colitis-related genes such as COX-2, PAP, MMP family, S100a8, S100a9 and DEFA1.
In 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing the EGF receptor, LCSFA exposure also specifically inhibited EGF-induced GLUT4-mediated glucose transport, but not EGF-induced glycogen synthesis.
A monoclonal antibody to the 57-kDa hemopexin-binding protein of 706705 recognized a 57-kDa protein on Western blots of the cell envelope proteins of 706705, DL42, and Eagan; no reaction was observed with the 100-kDa hemopexin-binding protein of DL42.
Different routes of bone morphogenic protein (BMP) receptor endocytosis influence BMP signaling.
Analysis of alkaline phosphatase (APase) EC (3.1.3.1)
Thymidine kinase [ATP: thymidine 5'-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.21]
Moreover, SATB1 induced EMT processes through downregulation of E-cadherin, upregulation of E-cadherin repressors (Snail, Slug and vimentin).
Osteopontin is a secreted, integrin-binding and phosphorylated acidic glycoprotein, which has an important role in tumour progression.
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are transmembrane proteins which via G-proteins initiate some of the important signaling pathways in a cell and are involved in various physiological processes.
The Intersectin 1 (ITSN1) protein functions in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and in MAP kinase signaling.
glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2), glucose phosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9),
This reactivity is mediated by non-integrin receptor, elastin binding protein.
In addition, it significantly modulated the expression patterns of Sonic hedgehog a (Shha), Neurogenin1 (Ngn1), Embryonic lethal abnormal vision like protein 3 (Elavl3), and Glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap).
