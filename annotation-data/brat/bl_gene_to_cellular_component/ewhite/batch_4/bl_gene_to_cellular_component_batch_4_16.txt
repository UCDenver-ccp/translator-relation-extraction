These cholesterol-rich microdomains are important, owing to enrichment therein of significant amounts of key transport proteins involved in uptake of cholesterol [SR-B1, ABCA-1, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), sterol carrier binding protein (SCP-2)], FA transport protein (FATP), and glucose transporters 1 and 2 (GLUT1, GLUT2) insulin receptor.
Akt and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were activated in BK-stimulated cells.
Involvement of phosphorylation of Tyr-31 and Tyr-118 of paxillin in MM1 cancer cell migration.
Frondanol-A5P induced phosphorylation of stress-activated protein kinase and Janus kinase (SAPK/JAK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP) within 5 minutes.
FOXA1 is an important regulator of prostate development, collaborating with androgen receptor (AR).
The Ras-Raf-MEK [(mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase]-MAPK signaling pathway controls the activation of many cellular functions.
Chemokine receptors are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) phosphorylated by G-protein receptor kinases (GRKs) after ligand-mediated activation.
We have shown here that caffeine up-regulates the tumor suppressor proteins p16, p21, p53 and Cav-1, and reduces the expression/secretion of various cytokines (IL-6, TGF-?, SDF-1 and MMP-2), and down-regulates ?-SMA.
Overexpression of JAK2(K882E) enhanced the ability of leptin to stimulate STAT3 phosphorylation in JAK2-null cells.
This treatment also down-regulated the gene expression of different MRFs, including Myf5, Myogenin and MyoD2.
Here, we show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling upregulates LSD1 protein levels in SKOV3 and HO8910 ovarian cancer cells overexpressing both LSD1 and the EGF receptor.
Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the binding of SIRT3 with NMNAT2 is a novel regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis in NSCLC cell lines, implicating the interaction between SIRT3 and NMNAT2, energy metabolism associated with SIRT3.
Blocking MMP-2 or MMP-9 reverses EphB1-Fc treatment-induced downregulation of EphB1 receptor.
We propose that Tax binding via the Chk2 kinase domain sequesters phosphorylated Chk2 within chromatin, thus hindering chromatin egress and appropriate response to DNA damage.
Tenascin-C deposition requires beta3 integrin and Src.
Interestingly, ASIC1a interacts with PICK1 (protein interacting with C-kinase 1), an intracellular protein that regulates trafficking of several membrane proteins.
Guggulsterone suppresses the activation of transcription factor IRF3 induced by TLR3 or TLR4 agonists.
These included monocyte chemoattractant protein, transmembrane protein 3, tetratricopeptide repeat protein 1, a ubiquitin-like 17-kDa protein, ubiquitin-specific protease ISG43, an RNA helicase DEAD box protein, GTP-binding MX protein, the cytokine IP-10, and the PKR activator PACT.
Moreover, SOCS1 upregulation was dependent on p38/AP-1 and JNK/AP-1 signaling pathways rather than classical type I IFN signaling pathways.
Expression of calmodulin and calmodulin binding proteins in rat fibroblasts stably transfected with protein kinase C and oncogenes.
