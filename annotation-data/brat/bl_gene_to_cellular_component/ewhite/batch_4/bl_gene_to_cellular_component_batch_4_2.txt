Recent studies indicate that the S1P2 receptor regulates critical intracellular signalling pathways, such as Rho GTPase, the phosphatase PTEN, and VE-cadherin-based adherens junctions.
In brain microtubule protein, MAP-1B appears to be phosphorylated in vitro by an endogenous casein kinase II-like activity which also phosphorylates the related protein MAP-1A but scarcely phosphorylates MAP-2.
A novel mechanism of TGFbeta-induced actin reorganization mediated by Smad proteins and Rho GTPases.
Menin is also required for the activin-induced inhibition of prolactin expression mediated by the Smads and the transcription factor, Pit-1.
We show that TCF4 and BCL9/Pygopus recruit beta-catenin to the nucleus, and APC, axin and axin2 enrich beta-catenin in the cytoplasm.
The membrane bile acid receptor TGR5 drives cell growth and migration via activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in non-small cell lung cancer.
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-specific antibody-modified FcBP-NPs (HER2/FcBP-NPs) showed 5.3-fold higher binding affinity to HER2 than isotype IgG antibody-modified NPs, and 2.6-fold higher affinity compared with anti-HER2 antibody-conjugated Mal-NPs.
These are the first data to identify a specific molecular chaperone for Smad4, suggesting a model in which TRAP1 brings Smad4 into the vicinity of the receptor complex and facilitates its transfer to the receptor-activated Smad proteins.
Serum anti-CCP antibody and anti-PAD4 antibody levels were measured by ELISA.
We show that Arl3 and RP2 mediate the localization of GFP-Kif17 to the cilia tip and competitive binding of RP2 and Arl3 with Kif17 complexes.
TNF-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE, ADAM17) cleaves membrane-associated cytokines and receptors and thereby regulates inflammatory and immune events, as well as lung development and mucin production.
Knockdown of TLR2 and TLR4 inhibited the fibrinogen-induced MCP-1 mRNA upregulation.
Through structure-function analyses of uPAR, VN and integrins, we document that uPAR-mediated cell adhesion to VN triggers a novel type of integrin signalling that is independent of integrin-matrix engagement.
These were; 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein precursor, α-enolase, calreticulin, mitochondrial H + -ATPase, palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 and initiation factor 5a.
Among these ATG proteins, the LC3/GABARAP proteins are known to regulate autophagosome biogenesis/maturation and cargo recognition.
Under basal conditions, Keap1 sequesters Nrf2 in the cytoplasm by binding to its Neh2 domain.
Drebrin, a side binding protein of actin filaments and well known for spine formation, was identified as a phosphorylated protein.
Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B negatively regulates integrin signaling.
Expression of uPA was significantly correlated with the expression of ERK and Stat3, while expression of PAI-1 was correlated with the uPA receptor and Akt activation, presumably via integrin and HER-receptor signalling.
Collagen glycosylation is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum by the galactosyltransferases COLGALT1 and COLGALT2.
