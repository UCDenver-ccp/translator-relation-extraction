The mechanism was demonstrated through the detection of mRNA expression of VEGF, MMP-9, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and uPA by RT-PCR, which showed that the hexamer down-regulated the VEGF and uPA mRNA expressions in ECV304 cells, but up-regulated the TIMP-1 mRNA expression.
Immunohistochemical studies were performed using antibodies against extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 MAPK (p38), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), phospho-MAPKs (P-MAPKs), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA).
NS1 expressed cells showed significant association of ribosomal proteins with MDM2, and p53 accumulation, suggesting induced nucleolar stress.
Curiously, immunohistochemical localization of SRF protein suggested that whereas endogenous SRF was homogeneously dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus, the dominant-negative SRF protein was concentrated in the nucleus.
Loading of RAD51 to chromatin was decreased in NEK8-depleted cells and Nek8-knockout cells.
Interestingly, the MDM2 protein was found to co-localize with p53 to nucleolar structures following proteasome inhibition.
By inhibiting MIG6 expression, miR-148a reduced EGFR trafficking to Rab7-expressing compartments, which includes late endosomes and lysosomes.
Sixteen different genes, including DR6(death receptor-6), PIAS3 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT3)and RanBPM(Ran-binding protein in the microtubule-organizing center), were identified after BLAST in GenBank.
MiR-542-3p expression is downregulated by the activation of c-Src-related signaling molecules, including epidermal growth factor receptor, K-Ras and Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase.
Current models imply that the evolutionarily conserved, actin-binding Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin (ERM) proteins perform their activities at the plasma membrane by anchoring membrane proteins to the cortical actin network.
Bisindolylmaleimide IX induced a conformational change and subcellular redistribution of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondria, resulting in the release of the proapoptotic mediators cytochrome c, Smac and Omi/HtrA2 from the mitochondrial inner membrane space.
SNX8 predominantly localized to early and late endosomes, where SNX8 overexpression enhanced total APP levels, cell surface APP distribution and consequent soluble APPÎ± cleavage.
Ensconsin/Map7 promotes microtubule growth and centrosome separation in Drosophila neural stem cells.
A recombinant hDC-LAMP protein and a monospecific anti-hDC-LAMP polyclonal antibody were prepared.
These data demonstrate specific, high-affinity cell-surface binding proteins for BMP 2B.
Interaction of D-lactate dehydrogenase protein 2 (Dld2p) with F-actin: implication for an alternative function of Dld2p.
Changes in the expression levels of Prp43-interacting G-patch proteins modulate the cellular localization of Prp43 and G-patch protein overexpression causes accumulation of the helicase in the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm.
Polyclonal antibodies raised against specific DUX4 peptides detected the DUX4 protein in cells transfected with D4Z4 elements.
Up-regulations of Snai1, Twist, FAK, and Paxillin via enhanced Smad dependent sigaling led to increased capacities of adhesion and migration.
In T lymphocytes, several signaling proteins are associated with lipid rafts including the protein tyrosine kinase LCK and the adapter protein LAT.
