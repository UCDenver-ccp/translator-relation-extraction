This adhesion was suppressed by anti-ICAM-1 antibody and anti-IL-6R antibody, but not by antibodies against VCAM-1 or E-selectin.
For apoptosis induced by ART, cleaved caspase-3/-9 was detected, and the pro-apoptotic protein Bcl-2-associated X protein was upregulated while the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was downregulated.
Transformed alpha 2-macroglobulin as a low-affinity growth hormone-binding protein.
Anti-COXII peptide antibodies recognized petunia COXII but no other mitochondrial proteins.
Our study explored the clinical and prognostic role of known HER family members, human epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR or HER1), HER2, HER3 and HER4.
Mammalian LGN/AGS3 proteins and their Drosophila Pins orthologue are cytoplasmic regulators of G-protein signaling.
Following NGF stimulation, MKP-1 protein mainly localizes on mitochondria, suggesting an interaction with p38 MAPK in this compartment.
The possible role of the p38 MAP kinase in the phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 is discussed.
Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a multidomain focal adhesion protein implicated in signal transduction between integrins and growth factor/extracellular receptors.
We observed increased expression of p53, activated caspase-1, CDKN1A, CDKN2A (p16INK4a), TLR4, and IFN? in aged primary RPE cell lines.
Using an anti-p67(phox) antibody or an anti-p47(phox) antibody, we showed that phosphorylated p67(phox) and p47(phox) form a complex.
Foxn1 promotes keratinocyte differentiation by regulating the activity of protein kinase C.
Ift88 regulates Hedgehog signaling, Sfrp5 expression, and ?-catenin activity in post-natal growth plate.
All ErbB family members were expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors specific for the EGF receptor (EGFR) or ErbB2 blocked the EGF-mediated induction of SMURF1 expression.
These alternatively activated microglia inhibited CNS inflammation through inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL10, as well as upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and opsonins, such as C1qa and C1qb.
Conversely, transduction of anti-miR-27 caused upregulation of Runx1 protein, thereby antagonizing the CSF3-mediated granulocyte differentiation.
S1P signaling is mediated by the S1P family of G protein-coupled receptors (S1P(1-5) receptors).
Mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent and protein kinase C-dependent pathways link the m1 muscarinic receptor to beta-amyloid precursor protein secretion.
Synaptotagmin-12, a synaptic vesicle phosphoprotein that modulates spontaneous neurotransmitter release.
Upon inflammatory challenges, P-selectin binds to PSGL-1 (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1, CD162) to mediate neutrophil rolling, during which integrins become activated by extracellular stimuli for their firm adhesion in a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)-dependent mechanism.
