Here we demonstrate that Ghrl and ghrelin receptor (growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR)) are expressed in thymic stromal cells and that their expression declines with physiological aging.
Down-regulated proteins including PLD2, ANXA2.
Further, sanguinarine-treatment to AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells resulted in a dose dependent (i) increase in pro-apoptotic Bax, Bid and Bak proteins; (ii) decrease in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) proteins; and (iii) decrease in p53 with an increase in its phosphorylation.
Parathyroid hormone increases mac25/insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-related protein-1 expression in cultured osteoblasts.
Phospholipase A2 receptor 1 (PLA2R) mediates collagen-dependent migration.
BMP-2 regulates COX-2 expression through ALK3-Smad1 signaling, and PGE2 induces ATF4 phosphorylation via EP4-ERK1/2-RSK2 axis.
Annexin A2 (ANXA2), a phospholipid-binding protein, has multiple biological functions depending on its cellular localization.
The gap junctions contained connexin43 protein and perhaps other proteins.
As new gelsolin-interacting partners we identified the ribosomal protein Rpsa, also known as a non-integrin laminin receptor (LamR), and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hnRNP U. Our data furthermore indicate that gelsolin interacts with particular components of the three cytoskeleton systems: nestin (intermediate filaments), Arp3 (actin cytoskeleton) and ?-tubulin (microtubules).
Although cytokines upregulate phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in several target cells, the contribution of individual PLA2 to cytokine-induced AA release and eicosanoid production remains unclear because of the existence of various forms of cellular PLA2.
Carbachol also increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2, p60Src, and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).
SO co-administration recovered CYP, downregulating the expression of glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase, and superoxide dismutase.
Relative content of myospecific proteins (KRP - kinase-related protein, desmin), cytoskeletal proteins (tubulin, vinculin, and myosin light chain kinase - MLCK) and extracellular matrix protein, fibronectin, was determined by immunoblotting.
MALAT1 promoted osteogenesis differentiation by sponging miR-214 to upregulate ATF4.
TIMAP is suppressed by TGF? via HDAC3-associated Smad signaling.
Mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic tail of the G protein-coupled receptor for parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related protein: effects on receptor expression and signaling.
Transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?)-activated Smad3 and interleukin-2 (IL-2)-activated Stat5 facilitated Tet1 and Tet2 binding to Foxp3.
In contrast, miR-7 inhibition of MCF-7/HER2?16 cell proliferation involved a pathway where miR-7 expression resulted in the inactivation of Src kinase independent of suppressed EGFR expression.
RANKL downregulates cell surface CXCR6 expression through JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway during osteoclastogenesis.
Notably, CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cells in SF expressed increased levels of inflammation-related trafficking chemokine receptors, such as CCR4, CCR5, and CXCR4.
