The expression of Î¼- and m-calpain, calpastatin, atrogin-1, and MuRF1 was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
These data suggest that TIEG2 serves as a downstream mediator of TGF-beta, bridging TGF-beta-dependent signaling to the intracellular pathway of apoptosis.
Proteasome inactivation promotes p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation and increases interleukin-8 production in retinal pigment epithelial cells.
The integrin IIbbeta3 mediates platelet aggregation through its fibrinogen and adhesive protein-binding properties.
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are integral membrane proteins that mediate cellular response to an extensive variety of extracellular stimuli.
Trans-synaptic EphB2-ephrin-B3 interaction regulates excitatory synapse density by inhibition of postsynaptic MAPK signaling.
Diabetic spectrin bound 32% less cDDP than normal spectrin (P less than 0.001); the lowest cDDP binding was observed with spectrin from insulin-dependent diabetic subjects.
RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type 2 diabetes, in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and insulin-mediated glucose uptake.
This work identifies a key role for the Rab38/Rab32 subfamily of Rab proteins in the biogenesis of melanosomes and potentially other lysosome-related organelles.
Specific silence of Nrf2 by siRNA down-regulated tanshinone IIA-induced Nrf2 activation and increased of intracellular GSH, NADPH and G6PDH levels.
The cell-surface proteins MTf, TFRC and ERBB2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2) were detected by immunoluminescent technique using different polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies.
The monoclonal antibody to the IGF-I receptor (alpha-IR3) inhibits 125I-IGF-I binding and immunoprecipitates the IGF-I receptor.
The cytochrome C oxidase assembly protein SCO1 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein essential for the mammalian energy metabolism.
Expression of gap junction proteins Cx26, Cx31.1, Cx37, and Cx43 in developing and mature rat epidermis.
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibits transforming growth factor-beta /Smad signaling in human dermal fibroblasts via AP-1 activation.
Immunohistochemistry staining with anti-KIF23 V1 antibody revealed that KIF23 V1 was mainly distributed in the nucleus, whereas the positive staining signals were predominantly in the cytoplasm when using anti-KIF23 antibody, suggesting that KIF23 V2 might localize in the cytoplasm of HCC cells.
We will discuss the observation that growth factors and oncogenic transformation via the mitogen-activated protein kinases p42/p44 MAPKs not only activate the VEGF promoter through the Sp1/AP-2 transcriptional factor complex but also phosphorylate HIF-1alpha leading in turn to enhance HIF-1 dependent transcriptional activation of VEGF.
In contrast, recombinant KNTvd4(-) overexpressed in RINm5F cells associated with amylin-containing vesicles and inhibited amylin secretion, but had no discernible affect on amylin expression.
alpha 2-Macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (alpha 2MR/LRP) is a multifunctional membrane receptor for endocytosis of various ligands involved in protease and cytokine activity regulation.
Increasing Miro1 expression levels recruits Grif-1 to mitochondria.
