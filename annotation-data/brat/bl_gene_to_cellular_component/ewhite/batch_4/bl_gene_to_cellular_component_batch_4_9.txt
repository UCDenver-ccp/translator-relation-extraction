As we found that CUG2 enhances activation of MAPK (ERK, JNK and p38), Src kinase and Ras, we examined whether CUG2 confers reoviral replication independent of the Ras or p38 MAPK signaling pathway.
Moreover, EA reduced protein expression of PLA2 and p38 MAPK, and inhibited phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in the lumbar spinal cord but not in the cerebral grey matter.
Up-regulated proteins in metastatic carcinomas included proliferating cell nuclear antigen, ferritin light chain, bomapin, tropomyosin 3, thioredoxin-containing domain C5, adenosin, ornithine aminotransferase, coronin 1A, RAN-binding protein 1,3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1. Down-regulated proteins in metastatic carcinomas included calretinin, myosin, light chain 2, peroxiredoxin 6, maspin, ibrinogen beta chain, vinculin, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, tropomyosin 1, annexin A5, and Rho GTPase activating protein 1.
IQGAP1 is a multidomain protein that participates in numerous cellular functions, including Rac1/Cdc42 and Ca(2+)/calmodulin signaling and actin polymerization.
We determined the transcript levels of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis-regulating molecules (corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), CRH receptors, CRH binding protein, mineralocorticoid receptor/glucocorticoid receptor), transcription factors that regulate CRH expression, CRH-stimulating cytokines, chaperone proteins, retinoid signaling, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tropomyosin-related kinase B, cytochrome proteins, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and monoamines.
Expression of Oct-4 was induced in cell nuclei with up-regulation of EMT markers (Snail, Slug and vimentin), and down-regulation of E-cadherin.
PRR14 associates with the nuclear lamina and attaches to heterochromatin through its binding partner, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1).
A cohort of 1,665 adult, female mutation carriers, including 1,122 BRCA1 carriers (433 cases) and 543 BRCA2 carriers (238 cases) were genotyped for SNPs in IGF1, IGF1 receptor (IGF1R), IGF1 binding protein (IGFBP1, IGFBP2, IGFBP5), and IGF receptor substrate 1 (IRS1).
We altered the mitochondrial distribution in vivo by overexpressing Mfn1, a mitochondrial shaping protein, or the Miro-binding domain of TRAK2 (TRAK2-MBD), a truncated form of a motor-adaptor protein.
NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression induced by TNF-alpha, TNFR1, TNFR-associated death domain protein, TNFR-associated factor 2, TGF-beta-activated kinase 1, receptor-interacting protein, NF-kappaB-inducing kinase, and IkappaB kinase beta was abolished by simvastatin.
Genes with significantly higher expression in HCV included chemokines CXCL10, CXCL11 interferon IFNA2, interferon receptors IFNAR1, IL10RB negative regulators of interferon signaling SOCS3, USP18, JAK/STAT and IRF family members STAT1, STAT2, and IRF, and TGFB family members TGFB1, TGFBR1, and TGFBR2 and other ISGs like OAS2, IF127, IF144 and ISG15.
The expression of CD117, HER2/neu, EGFR, VEGF, and PDGFR was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining.
Glutathione S-transferase mu (GST-M1) and theta (GST-T1) are isoforms of glutathione transferase enzymes that participate in the metabolism of a wide range of chemicals.
Basal levels as well as Vp16- or mitomycin C-stimulated levels of p53 and p21 protein were decreased in the catalase-overexpressing cells as compared with control cells; however, p53 mRNA levels were not decreased by catalase.
The high- density lipoprotein receptor scavenger receptor class B type I, tetraspanin CD81, tight junction protein claudin-1, and occludin are the main receptors that mediate the initial step of HCV infection.
Integrin-mediated cell adhesion activates mitogen-activated protein kinases.
Downstream signaling of IGF-I can phosphorylate and inactivate GSK-3beta, thereby enhancing beta-catenin protein.
Analysis of cells treated with a p21-derived PCNA-binding peptide provides additional evidence that the growth inhibitory effects of p21 and p21CDK result from their ability to bind to PCNA.
Ectopic expression of GADD45? increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation, whereas siRNA knockdown of GADD45? decreased the PXR-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation, confirming that GADD45? can regulate PXR-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation in HepG2 cells.
Calmodulin and calbindin antibodies labeled stereocilia in intact cells.
