Three of the upregulated proteins (myosin regulatory light polypeptide 9, four and a half LIM domains protein 1 and LIM and SH3 domain protein 1) are involved in cell migration, while downregulated protein transgelin is involved in replicative senescence.
In addition, we observed Akt phosphorylation in response to epinephrine; this was stimulated by phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).
In conclusion, ANXA7 was an endogenous regulator of HMBOX1, and ABO promoted HMBOX1 translation by inhibiting ANXA7 GTPase activity and enhancing TGFB2-OT1 expression.
The phosphorylation of synapsin I and synapsin II, two homologous presynaptic vesicle-associated proteins, is thought to promote neurotransmitter release.
PIAS1 is a GATA4 SUMO ligase that regulates GATA4-dependent intestinal promoters independent of SUMO ligase activity and GATA4 sumoylation.
The results reveal that the levels of IRS-1 and PI3K proteins in the Flot1-RNAi and Flot2-RNAi groups were significantly down-regulated.
Distinct roles of Rab3B and Rab13 in the polarized transport of apical, basolateral, and tight junctional membrane proteins to the plasma membrane.
Fbln7 bound to angiopoietin-1, but not angiopoietin-2 or Tie2 receptor, through interaction between the N-terminal portions of Fbln7 and angiopoietin-1, and it blocked phosphorylation of Tie2 receptor in HUVEC.
The activity of the kinase is regulated by binding of cdk5 activators (p35, p39, p67).
alpha-catenin is a major beta-catenin-binding protein, and overexpressed alpha-catenin can negatively regulate beta-catenin activity.
Endoglin modulation of TGF-beta1-induced collagen synthesis is dependent on ERK1/2 MAPK activation.
Activation of ERK requires both p50/p105 and the MAPK kinase kinase, Tpl-2.
Short interfering RNA down-regulation of tuberin decreased the p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation and B-Raf activity.
Regulation of the HDM2-p53 pathway by ribosomal protein L6 in response to ribosomal stress.
In bone marrow stromal cell cultures, r-irisin rapidly phosphorylated Erk, and up-regulated Atf4, Runx2, Osx, Lrp5, ?-catenin, Alp, and Col1a1; this is consistent with a direct receptor-mediated action to stimulate osteogenesis.
Vinflunine, a novel microtubule inhibitor, suppresses calmodulin interaction with the microtubule-associated protein STOP.
The following parameters were evaluated at baseline and on surgical specimens after PCT: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), Ki-67, p53, human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and apoptosis.
In all injury models biliary cells expressed the cell surface proteins matriptase and HAI-1.
These overexpressions up-regulate the antioxidant proteins catalase and SOD and the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL.
CBP is the acetyltransferase for PYCR1, whereas SIRT3 deacetylates PYCR1.
