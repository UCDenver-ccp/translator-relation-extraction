We identified the upstream kinase MEKK1 as an activator of both the ERK1/2 and JNK2 pathways, whereby the ERK1/2 kinase MEK1 and the JNK kinase MKK7 bind to MEKK1 in a competing fashion.
The adaptor protein ankyrin-R interacts via its membrane binding domain with the cytoplasmic domain of the anion exchange protein (AE1) and via its spectrin binding domain with the spectrin-based membrane skeleton in human erythrocytes.
Mechanistically, SIRT6 regulates Tau protein stability and phosphorylation through increased activation of the kinase GSK3?/?.
Changes in cell and nuclear morphology were observed as well as alterations in the expression of growth factors (interleukin-6 and insulin-like growth factor binding proteins) and matrix proteins (collagen type I and osteocalcin).
?-arrestin promotes Wnt-induced low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (Lrp6) phosphorylation via increased membrane recruitment of Amer1 protein.
Moreover, elimination of endogenous PIG3 in p53-proficient HCT116 cells decreased p53 phosphorylation in response to UV irradiation.
Thus, lefty provides a repressed state of TGF-beta- or BMP-responsive genes and participates in negative modulation of TGF-beta and BMP signaling by inhibition of phosphorylation of R-Smad proteins.
In heterologous cells, EWS-FLI1 induces p53-dependent cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) interacts with integrins during cell spreading and motility, but little is known about the role of EGFR in these mechanosensing processes.
Structure of the cytosolic domain of TOM5, a mitochondrial import protein.
Transcription induction, needed for cell-cell fusion, is mediated by G?? and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) scaffold protein Ste5.
IL-10/HMOX1 signaling modulates cochlear inflammation via negative regulation of MCP-1/CCL2 expression in cochlear fibrocytes.
LUVA cells possess metachromatic cytoplasmic granules that are immunoreactive for tryptase, cathepsin G, and carboxypeptidase A3.
A new MAP kinase termed big MAP kinase 1 (BMK1/ERK5) has been shown to phosphorylate and activate the transcription factor MEF2C, which is highly expressed in EC.
The 6 most upregulated genes (CCNB2, CDC20, PRC1, SYCP2, NUSAP1, CDKN3) belong to the mitosis pathway.
In this study, we examined downstream signaling targets to study the BMP-Smad and BMP-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in FOP.
The protein expression of RhoC, phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-MAPK), and Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) was determined by Western blotting.
Role of SAP97 protein in the regulation of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 endocytosis and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling.
Integrin ligand binding was also necessary for MCF-7 cells to migrate in response to IGF-I; alpha V beta 5 integrin was required for migration on vitronectin and alpha 2 beta 1 was required on collagen.
Tob38-depleted mitochondria are deficient in the import of beta-barrel precursor proteins, but not of other outer membrane proteins or proteins of other mitochondrial subcompartments.
