SH2-Balpha can be immunoprecipitated using anti-(insulin receptor) antibody from insulin-stimulated cells.
Here, we use ADAM10-deficient cells transfected with wild type or mutant ADAM10 to address the role of its cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain in regulating ADAM10-dependent protein ectodomain shedding.
Examination of integrin heterodimers showed that while alpha4 integrin was predominantly expressed on beta1high/beta7-/low cells, alphaE integrin was primarily associated with beta7high.
Resveratrol also caused p53 binding to the p21 promoter and increased abundance of COX-2 protein in UMSCC-22B cell nuclei.
IcarisideII down-regulated the activation of the oxidative stress associated proteins ASK1, p38 and JNK; inhibited the expression of p53, Bax and cleaved-caspase3 in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway; and up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2.
EphB2/CTF2, but not a kinase-deficient mutant of EphB2/CTF2, promotes the cell surface expression of NMDAR.
Deregulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways occurs in melanoma and breast cancer, deregulating normal cellular apoptosis and proliferation.
Nuclear envelope protein MAN1 regulates clock through BMAL1.
Nucleophosmin (NPM1) is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling phosphoprotein, mainly localized at nucleoli, that plays a key role in ribogenesis, centrosome duplication, and response to stress stimuli.
These observations suggest that GPI-80 belongs to the beta2 integrin-associated GPI-anchored protein family, which has regulatory activity in cell adherence.
Antibody against the DNA-binding domain of Jun protein markedly reduced the AP-1 but not the Sp1 binding activity.
Activation of chimeric and full-length growth hormone receptors by growth hormone receptor monoclonal antibodies.
According to the nuclear cycle, Notch1-IC is degraded by E3 ligase, FBW7 in the nucleus via phosphorylation-dependent degradation.
Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a multidomain cytosolic hydrolase acting mostly on nonhistone protein substrates.
In H1-depleted chromatin histone H2B becomes the major poly(ADP-ribose) histone acceptor protein, whereas in native chromatin histone H1 was the major histone acceptor.
Both FXR1 and FXR2 are autosomal gene homologues of FMR1.
Moreover, the R-Smad-Runx signaling pathways are regulated by an E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1, as well as a signal transducer of interferons, STAT1.
Glioma cell sensitivity to CD95-mediated apoptosis is regulated by CD95 expression at the cell surface and by the levels of intracellular apoptosis-regulatory proteins, including bcl-2 family members.
MSI1-like WD40 repeat proteins are subunits of many protein complexes controlling chromatin dynamics.
Subcellular localization of Bcl2 and APE1 was analyzed by subcellular fractionation.
