Moreover, Rab25 interacts with β1 integrin and promotes its trafficking to the cytoplasmic membrane.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with specific antibodies revealed integrins VLA-1 and VLA-5.
Mechanistically, QS treatment increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and downregulated phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK).
Vitamin B1 influences pro-apoptotic proteins, mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome C release, protein kinases, p38-MAPK, suppresses oxidative stress-induced NF-kappaB and has anti-inflammatory properties.
Rab10 delivers GLUT4 storage vesicles to the plasma membrane.
The focal adhesion protein vinculin connects the actin cytoskeleton, through talin and integrins, with the extracellular matrix.
Insulin induces the serine phosphorylation of the nucleolar protein nucleolin at subnanomolar concentrations in differentiated 3T3-442A cells.
Nutrient fluctuations and insulin resistance drive β-cells to synthesize insulin beyond their capacity for protein folding and secretion and thereby activate the unfolded protein response (UPR), an adaptive signalling pathway to promote cell survival upon accumulation of unfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
We show that Ciao1 can functionally replace Cia1 and support cytosolic Fe/S protein biogenesis.
We show that Hsp70.1 being localized at the lysosomal membrane, lysosomal lipid BMP levels, and the lipid binding domain of Hsp70.1 are crucial for Hsp70.1-BMP
Alpha7beta1 integrin is a receptor for laminin-2 on Schwann cells.
We identified a PDZ domain-binding motif in Par6 that was essential for its interaction with Par3 in vitro and for Par3-mediated membrane localization of Par6 in cultured cells.
Because CHK1 and CHK2 share some substrates such as CDC25C in vitro, this assay could also be used for CHK2 activity assay, except that the CHK2 antibody will replace the CHK1 antibody.
Our data provide evidence that PEX19p is a cytosolic acceptor protein for the peroxisomal ABC transporters ALDP, PMP70, and ALDRP and might be involved in the intracellular sorting and trafficking of these proteins to the peroxisomal membrane.
Chromosome misalignment is induced significantly in HeLa cells by Cdc42 depletion and not by depletion of either one or all of the other four Cdc42-like GTPases (TC10, TCL, Wrch1 or Wrch2), four Rac-like GTPases or three Rho-like GTPases.
The inhibitors used included monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4D5, which targets ErbB2, and the small molecular weight kinase inhibitors CGP59326 and PKI166, which block the activity of ErbB1 or both ErbB1 and ErbB2, respectively.
Fifteen key proteins were identified and categorized into a special protein family F(K), which included Cyclin D1 (CCND1), E-cadherin (CDH1), Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12), epidermal growth factor (EGF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), TNF receptor superfamily, member 6(FAS), FK506 binding protein 12-rapamycin associated protein 1 (FRAP1), O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), parkinson protein 2, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (PARK2), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), calcium channel voltage-dependent alpha 2/delta subunit 2 (CACNA2D2), tubulin beta class I (TUBB), SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 2 (SMARCA2), and wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 7A (WNT7A).
Disintegrins and disintegrins-like proteins are able to inhibit platelet aggregation and integrin-mediated cell adhesion.
Furthermore, the results demonstrated that PINK1 influenced mitochondrial fission/fusion by regulating MFN2 and phosphorylating Drp1.
Immobilized CCL21, CCL25, CCL28, and CXC-chemokine ligand (CXCL) 12 all converted rolling adhesion to static arrest on MAdCAM-1 by activating lymphocyte integrins, but only CCL21 and CXCL12 also triggered a motile phenotype characterized by lamelipodia and uropod formation.
