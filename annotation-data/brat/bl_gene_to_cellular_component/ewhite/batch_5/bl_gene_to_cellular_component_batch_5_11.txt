This study thus indicated that catalpol, via inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK2 signaling pathway, reverses the disaggregation of cytoskeleton actin in BMECs and prevents down-regulation of junctional proteins, such as claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1, and decreases endothelin-1 and inflammatory cytokine secretion, eventually alleviating the increase in LPS-induced BBB permeability.
The lysosomal granule membrane protein, LAMP-2, is also present in platelet dense granule membranes.
These biomarkers include calreticulin, fibrinogen-γ, superoxide dismutase, vimentin, malate dehydrogenase, and lamin B2.
In collagen gel co-cultures, Slit1 and Slit2 can repel and collapse olfactory axons.
Extracellular calcium-binding protein SPARC/osteonectin in Caenorhabditis elegans.
In accordance with this observation, NS-417 potentiated NGF-induced signaling, such as activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2 and the Akt kinase.
Transcriptional and posttranscriptional expression of telomere-binding proteins TRF1, TRF2, TIN2 and POT1, known to regulate telomere homeostasis and protection, were evaluated.
This defective cell adhesion could be partly explained by the decreased level of cell surface receptors of the beta 1-integrin family, i.e., the alpha 2 integrin subunit for type I collagen and the alpha 5 integrin subunit for fibronectin, observed in pathological fibroblasts.
The intracellular localization of Ankrd2 was unknown since no protein studies had been reported.
Instead, SIM+MET treatment led to Ripk1- and Ripk3-dependent necrosis by 48-96 h, determined by propidium iodide-Annexin V flow cytometry, increase in Ripk1 and Ripk3 protein expression, necrosome formation, HMGB-1 extracellular release, and necrotic induction and viability rescue with necrostatin-1 and Ripk3-targeting siRNA.
Chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9), a cell surface chemokine receptor which belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor, 7-trans-membrane superfamily, is expressed on lymphocytes in the circulation and is the key chemokine receptor that enables these cells to target the intestine.
Calmodulin binding proteins in human erythrocyte membranes.
Thus stretch-induced ERK1/ERK2 and p38 activation in both NG and HG is beta(1)-integrin and F-actin dependent.
Plasma from PE induced KCa3.1 down regulation, NOX2 upregulation, phosphorylated-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase downregulation, and superoxide generation, and these effects were prevented by antioxidants (tempol or tiron), NOX2 inhibition, or anti-lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor 1 (LOX1) antibody.
The NOX2-regulatory proteins p47(phox) and p67(phox) associated with the actin cytoskeleton and were found in cell protrusions and membrane ruffles, colocalizing with Rac1.
PHB1 was phosphorylated by the Src family tyrosine kinase Lyn, and palmitoylation of PHB1 was required for its association with the plasma membrane.
LKB1 protein might inhibit malignant biological behavior of A549 cells partly by down-regulating the tyrosine-phosphorylated level of STAT3 protein.
Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are isoenzymes occurring in the cytoplasm and as integral membrane proteins.
Domain-specific antibodies were used to determine the cellular localization of the desmosomal transmembrane glycoproteins (desmogleins 1 and 3 and desmocollin), desmosomal plaque proteins (desmoplakin, plakophilin and plakoglobin) and adherens junction-associated proteins (E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, beta-catenin and actin).
We validated the effect of UBR5 depletion on primary cilia formation using a robust model of ciliogenesis, and identified CSPP1, a centrosomal and ciliary protein required for cilia formation, as a UBR5-interacting protein.
