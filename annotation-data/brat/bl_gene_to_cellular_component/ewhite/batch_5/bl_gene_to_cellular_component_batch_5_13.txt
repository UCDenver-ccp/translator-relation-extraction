Among the G0/G1 phase in the cell cycle-related protein, the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27(Kip1) was increased in N. chinensis-treated HL-60 cells, whereas the expression levels of CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, cyclin D3, cyclin E, and cyclin A were decreased.
In fission yeast, heterochromatin formation requires RNAi and the histone H3K9 methyltransferase complex CLRC, composed of Clr4, Raf1, Raf2, Cul4, and Rik1.
Clinical relevance of serum measurements of insulin-like growth factors and somatomedin binding proteins.
The EGF-induced phosphorylation of S368 does not require internalization of the EGF receptor or association of GGA3 with membranes.
Western blot analysis and zymography were performed to evaluate expression of collagen type I, ?1 integrin receptor, IGF-IR, NF-?B protein, phospho-Akt protein, kinase MAPK, caspase 9 activity, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-9 and MMP-2).
These results suggest that glucocorticoid increased cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix via alpha1 beta1 integrin, and thereby antagonized EGF-induced cell migration.
Midkine stimulation of cultured meningioma cells induced phosphorylation of Akt, whereas no increase in phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK or p38 MAPK could be detected.
In fact, the E3 ligase scaffold proteins, Cul5 and Rbx2, were also found to be essential for Vif-mediated proteasomal degradation of STAT1 and STAT3.
Msx2-CM stimulated Wnt-dependent TCF/LEF transcription, and Msx2-transduced cells exhibited increased nuclear beta-catenin localization with concomitant alkaline phosphatase induction.
Cell homogenates were incubated with Trans-Signal Angiogenesis Antibody Array containing antibodies to angiogenic activators (ANG, HGF, leptin, VEGF, IL-6, IL-8, PIGF, FGF-alpha/beta, TNF-alpha and TGF-alpha) and inhibitors (IFN-gamma, IL-12, IP-10, TIMP-1 and -2).
Stat5 is a physiological substrate of the insulin receptor.
It accounts for FGF2 binding to FGF receptors (FGFRs) and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs), followed by receptor-phosphorylation, activation of the FRS2 adapter protein and the Ras-Raf signaling cascade.
In this review, we focus on the transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a subfamily of RTKs, by GPCRs.
Moesin immunoprecipitation with CD14, MD-2 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and co-immunoprecipitation of MyD88-interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) and IRAK-tumor necrosis factor receptor-activated factor 6 (TRAF6) were analyzed.
Signals of Ezh2, Src, and Akt Involve in myostatin-Pax7 pathways regulating the myogenic fate determination during the sheep myoblast proliferation and differentiation.
Caspase 3 and caspase 8 were activated and cytochrome c (cyt c) was released from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm; poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) was digested into two fragments; p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was phosphorylated; and the expression of pro-apoptosis protein Bax increased while the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 decreased.
Recent ligand screening of orphan G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) identified two LysoPS-specific human GPCRs, namely, P2Y10 (LPS2) and GPR174 (LPS3), which, together with previously reported GPR34 (LPS1), comprise a LysoPS receptor family.
LMP1 and the cellular protein CD40, which also induces EGFR expression, interact with the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins.
Upon full activation, Raf kinases phosphorylate and activate downstream kinase in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway.
We subsequently verified the SH2 domain binding to the actin-binding protein HIP55 and to FYB/ADAP, and the SH3-mediated binding to the nuclear proteins SFPQ/NONO.
