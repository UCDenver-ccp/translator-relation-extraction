UA-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as evidenced by the upregulation of the mRNA and protein expressions of GRP78 and PDI.
Paraffin slices were labeled with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by immunofluorescence staining, and then were co-labeled with hexaribonucleotide binding protein-3 (NeuN), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and anti-integrin Î±M (CD11b) antibody (OX-42) to explore the associations of p38MAPK and JNK with nerve cells or glial cell.
However, in the healthy kidney endogenous BMP7 ligand is vigorously counteracted by extracellular antagonists such as USAG1 and CHRDL1.
The P. acnes-induced increase in hBD2 and IL-8 gene expression could be inhibited by anti-Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and anti-TLR4 neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that P. acnes-induced secretion of soluble factors in keratinocytes are both TLR2 and TLR4 dependent.
Direct assay of protein kinase C activity showed that trypsin stimulation effected the translocation of Ca2+/phospholipid-activated protein kinase C from the cytosolic to the membrane fraction.
BDNF-TrkB signaling also triggers PSD-95 palmitoylation and its transport to synapses through the phosphorylation of the palmitoylation enzyme ZDHHC8 by a protein kinase C (PKC; Yoshii etal., 2011).
At low micromolar concentrations, Q3G increased LDLR expression, reduced PCSK9 secretion, and stimulated LDL uptake.
Sod1 and Ccs1 are dually localized proteins that reside in the cytosol and in the intermembrane space of mitochondria.
On the other hand, HGF induced colocalizations of both phosphorylated JNK and paxillin with the endosomal recycling protein GGA3 at 10h and depletion of GGA3 abolished membrane recycling of c-Met and phosphorylation of JNK/paxillin at the same time point.
In vitro GST-pull down assays revealed the direct interaction of importin-alpha with either Sgk or Erk/MAPK, while RNA interference knockdown of importin-alpha expression disrupted the localization of both Sgk and Erk into the nucleus of serum-treated cells.
CXCR7 reduced CXCL12 in the extracellular space, limiting the amounts of chemokine available to acutely stimulate signaling through CXCR4.
The EGF-RICa conjugate was competitive with [125I]EGF for binding to cell surface EGF receptors.
The human RhoA, CDC42, and Rac-1 proteins efficiently induce the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) by a mechanism that involves phosphorylation of Ikappa Balpha and translocation of p50/p50 and p50/p65 dimers to the nucleus, but independent of the Ras GTPase and the Raf-1 kinase.
The cytosolic domain C2AB of Synaptotagmin 1 and anti-Synaptotagmin 1 antibodies block granule docking.
Insulin-binding antibodies were absent from serum, erythrocyte insulin receptor binding was normal, and greater than 90% of circulating immunoreactive insulin coeluted with 125I-labeled insulin on gel filtration.
Attachment to the extracellular matrix is mediated by a complex of adhesion proteins, including integrins, signaling molecules, actin and actin-binding proteins, and scaffolding proteins.
PARM-1 promotes cardiomyogenic differentiation through regulating the BMP/Smad signaling pathway.
AdHGF-accelerated mineralisation correlated with increased Akt phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of Notch3 intracellular domain (N3IC) and up-regulation of the Notch3 target protein, HES1.
To the contrary, there was no difference in the subcellular localization of NRG1, ErbB1, ErbB2, and N-terminal ErbB4 between control and PSP patients.
Their integrin binding was measured by protein interaction ELISAs.
