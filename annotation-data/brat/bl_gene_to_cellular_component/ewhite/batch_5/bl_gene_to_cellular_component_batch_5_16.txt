This induction was also observed after co-transfection with Smad1 and Smad4, the intracellular signaling molecules of the BMP2 signaling pathway.
The four members of the family of synapse-associated protein 90/postsynaptic density-95-associated proteins (SAPAP1-4) are adapter proteins of postsynaptic density (PSD).
High mobility group nucleosome-binding protein 5 (HMGN5) is a chromatin architectural protein that binds specifically to nucleosomes and reduces the compaction of the chromatin fiber.
Rhodocetin is a snake venom protein that binds to alpha2beta1 integrin, inhibiting its interaction with its endogenous ligand collagen.
Insulin or IGF-1 resistance caused by CKD, acidosis, inflammation, glucocorticoids or cancer causes defects in insulin-stimulated intracellular signaling that suppresses IRS-1 activity leading to decreased phosphorylation of Akt (p-Akt).
Several trans-acting genes that affect silencing are found to encode either chromatin proteins such as chromodomain proteins Swi6 and Clr4 or the factors that affect chromatin assembly, including histone deacetylase homologs Clr3 and Clr6.
USP11 acts as a histone deubiquitinase functioning in chromatin reorganization during DNA repair.
EDF-1, a 16 kDa highly conserved intracellular protein, serves as a calmodulin binding protein and, upon nuclear translocation, functions as a coactivator of several transcription factors.
ITGA9 codes for a membrane receptor for neurotrophins and NRXN3 is a transmembrane neuronal adhesion receptor involved in synaptic differentiation.
The RGS9 binding partner G(beta5) further enhanced the nuclear localization of RGS9-2, but did not affect the strongly cytoplasmic localization of RGS9-1, the retinal form of RGS9.
Decreased expression of integrin β1, the ANGPTL4 receptor was observed during hypoxia/SD conditions, however, such decrease was reversed by ANGPTL4.
One of the major families of the mitogen-activated kinases (MAPK), p38, has been shown to transduce extracellular stress stimuli into cellular responses.
Furthermore, HNP1-3 caused a biphasic activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2).
After acute administration of TMT (0.0-9.0 mg/kg i.v.), effects on neuronal phosphoproteins were examined by three separate techniques: endogenous phosphorylation of total synaptic membrane proteins; radiometric assay of synapsin I, a neuron-specific phosphoprotein associated with synaptic vesicles; and radioimmunoassay of synapsin I and protein III, another synapse specific, synaptic vesicle-localized phosphoprotein.
We showed in vitro and in vivo that Hoxb4 and the Roc1 (also known as Rbx1)-Ddb1-Cul4a ubiquitin ligase core component formed a complex designated as RDCOXB4, which acted as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Geminin and down-regulated Geminin through the ubiquitin-proteasome system.
Immunofluorescence revealed that AANAT protein is localized in C-cell cytoplasm, and MT₁ protein in both cell populations.
The activation signal from tyrosine kinase receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is relayed via a highly conserved intracellular pathway involving Ras, Raf, and MAPK.
These included: (1) PML and Sp100 as the constituting components of PML nuclear bodies, (2) telomere repeat binding factors 1 and 2 (TRF1 and TRF2, respectively), (3) the DNA repair protein NBS1 and (4) the SUMO E3 ligase MMS21, as well as the isolated SUMO1 domain, through an interacting domain of another protein factor.
We concluded that HPV16 E5 protein inhibits hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis of cervical cancer cells by stimulating the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of Bax protein, and the pathway involves COX-2, PGE(2) and PKA.
TPs also induced mitochondrial-related apoptosis in GBC cells by upregulating Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved PARP expressions and downregulating Bcl-2, cyclin A, and Cdk2 expressions.
