One downstream mediator that cathepsin K regulates is PLF-1 (proliferin-1), which can potently stimulate growth of surviving neighboring smooth muscle cells through activation of PI3K/Akt/p38MAPK (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase)-dependent and -independent mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling cascades.
Proteomic analysis on the activation profile of p38 Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) indicated that the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was stimulated by EV71 infection upon MINK activation.
Several interacting proteins, including Axin, APC, and the protein kinase GSK-3beta are implicated in regulating beta-catenin phosphorylation and its subsequent degradation.
Differential activation of p38MAPK isoforms by MKK6 and MKK3.
These results suggest that NDR2-mediated Rabin8 phosphorylation is crucial for ciliogenesis by triggering the switch in binding specificity of Rabin8 from PS to Sec15, thereby promoting local activation of Rab8 and ciliary membrane formation.
Proteomic analysis of integrin-associated complexes identifies RCC2 as a dual regulator of Rac1 and Arf6.
Plasma somatomedin-binding proteins in hypopituitarism: changes during growth hormone therapy.
Among these proteins, MAP kinase, actin, paxillin and the EGF receptor were the most likely candidates for bradykinin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation.
This neuroprotection was associated with increased phosphorylation of neurofilaments, which are substrates of p44/42 MAPK and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5).
We previously showed that sphingosine 1-phosphate phosphorylates p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and p38 MAP kinase in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells.
Human TLE1 protein has been demonstrated to interact with mammalian AML1 protein, which regulates hematopoiesis and osteoblast differentiation.
(5) The proteomic analysis revealed several proteins that are differentially expressed because of NS-398 treatment; the down-regulated proteins identified are hnRNP K, alpha enolase, Hsp70, tropomyosin, and protein disulfide isomerase, the up-regulated protein is phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein.
Mutagenesis of the CASZ1b protein assay demonstrates that the N-terminus of CASZ1b is required for NuRD binding, and a poly(ADP-ribose) binding motif in the CASZ1b protein is required for histone H3 and DNA repair proteins binding.
Megalin-dependent cubilin-mediated endocytosis is a major pathway for the apical uptake of transferrin in polarized epithelia.
These genes were TGF-beta type I receptor gene (TGFBR1), TGF-beta type II receptor gene (TGFBR2), SMAD2 gene (SMAD2), SMAD3 gene (SMAD3), SMAD4 gene (SMAD4), and SMAD7 gene (SMAD7), all of which compose the TGF-beta1 signaling pathway.
Anti-Mre11 and anti-Rad50 antibodies were used to examine MRN complex localization in a wild-type strain and in spo11, mre11, and rad50 mutants.
Moreover, AE up-regulated p53, increased intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, depleted intracellular-reduced GSH, up-regulated cytochrome c and Bax, down-regulated Bcl-2, and activated caspase-9 and -3.
Progress in understanding the LDL receptor and HMG-CoA reductase, two membrane proteins that regulate the plasma cholesterol.
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key cell-surface proteins that transduce external environmental cues into biochemical signals across the membrane.
Antibodies directed against RAD51 and cohesin subunit SMC3 proteins were labeled with either fluorescence or colloidal gold to visualize RAD51 protein foci and synaptonemal complexes.
