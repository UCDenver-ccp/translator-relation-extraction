Alirocumab treatment also attenuated alcohol-induced PCSK9 mRNA elevation and upregulated LDL-receptor (LDL-R) via modulation of the transcription factors (SREBP-1, SREBP-2, and E2F1) in liver.
Phosphorylation of the Erk1/2 kinase, a downstream effector of EGFR signaling, was specifically associated with FlpA-mediated activation of β1-integrin and EGFR signaling.
The inhibition of both ALK5 and Smad3 dramatically blocked the TGF-β1-stimulated E-cadherin downregulation, F-actin reorganisation and migration of PDV cells.
p53 protein in XPC-deficient cells remains ubiquitylated, but its association with the proteasome is drastically reduced, indicating that XPC regulates a postubiquitylation event.
fibronectin suppressed the expression of subtype of integrin receptor ITGA5.
The TOR protein kinase functions in two distinct complexes, TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and 2 (TORC2).
Proximity ligation assays showed that Cad11 colocalizes with clathrin, and immunofluorescence assays showed that Cad11 localizes in vesicles that stain for the early endosomal marker Rab5.
Drosophila melanogaster HP1-interacting protein (Hip) is a partner of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and is involved in transcriptional epigenetic gene silencing and the formation of heterochromatin.
Microglial neurotoxins markedly stimulate the phosphorylation and activity of neuronal p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and provoke the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, which precedes apoptosis.
Western blot technique was used to determine phosphorylation level of p38-MAPK, ERK1/2, p90RSK and NHE-1 (previously immunoprecipitated with NHE-1 polyclonal antibody).
The mitogen-activated kinase phosphatase-3 (MKP-3) has gained great importance in the scientific community by acting as a regulator of the cell cycle through dephosphorylation of FoxO1, an important transcription factor involved in the insulin intracellular signaling cascade.
Neuropathy target esterase (NTE) and NTE-related esterase (NRE) are endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-anchored proteins belonging to the NTE protein family.
After the application of anti-STEAP4 antibodies at 0.002 mg/mL, adipocytes exhibited reduced insulin-stimulated glucose transport by attenuating the phosphorylation of IRS-1, PI3K (p85), and Akt.
Notably, ROSC increased anti-apoptotic proteins levels (PDGFR-α, AQP-4, hTERT), COX-1 activity and ribosome numbers.
We show here that BZR1 functions as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and GSK3-like kinases induce the nuclear export of BZR1 by modulating BZR1 interaction with the 14-3-3 proteins.
Our results establish a causative role for PKCβII and L-plastin in linking GM-CSF-induced eosinophil priming for chemotaxis and degranulation to signaling events associated with integrin activation via induction of PKCβII-mediated L-plastin phosphorylation.
We then expressed the prohibitin protein in bacteria and confirmed the antibody binding to prohibitin by Western blot.
In addition, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using antibodies against insulin receptor proteins to analyze tyrosine phosphorylation and serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor proteins.
Modern science has revealed that curcumin mediates its effects by modulation of several important molecular targets, including transcription factors (e.g., NF-kappaB, AP-1, Egr-1, beta-catenin, and PPAR-gamma), enzymes (e.g., COX2, 5-LOX, iNOS, and hemeoxygenase-1), cell cycle proteins (e.g., cyclin D1 and p21), cytokines (e.g., TNF, IL-1, IL-6, and chemokines), receptors (e.g., EGFR and HER2), and cell surface adhesion molecules.
PCSK9 proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type (PCSK9) protein plays an important role in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) metabolism, due to its role in the degradation of the LDL receptor.
