The collagen ColQ anchors acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the synaptic cleft of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ).
During infection with HSV-1, TLR3 recruited the metabolic checkpoint kinase complex mTORC2, which led to the induction of chemokines and trafficking of TLR3 to the cell periphery.
However, CDK2 bound by the truncated cyclin A2 is located in the cytoplasm in contrast to CDK2 bound to full-length cyclin A2, which is in the nucleus.
CTGF induced tryrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-associated protein (LRP) in fibroblasts, and the LRP-antagonist, receptor-associated protein (RAP) inhibited CTGF-induced tryrosine phosphorylation of LRP.
Taken together, FGF21 inhibits vascular calcification in vitro by modulating BMP2/Smad signaling pathway.
Microarray analysis revealed that the transcriptional response to ER stress is not mediated by Ire1, but instead is dependent largely on calcineurin signaling and partially on the Slt2 MAPK pathway.
Tenascins are extracellular matrix glycoproteins that act both as integrin ligands and as modifiers of fibronectin-integrin interactions to regulate cell adhesion, migration, proliferation and differentiation.
TGF-beta1 is a key cytokine in the process of fibrogenesis, using intracellular signalling pathways involving the ALK5 receptor and signalling molecules Smad2 and Smad3.
The three axon growth inhibitory proteins, myelin associated glycoprotein, oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein and Nogo-A, can all bind to the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR).
TdT-positive nuclei were quantitated, and dual immunostains for TdT/CD79a, TdT/CD3, and TdT/CD43 were performed in a subset of cases; flow cytometry was performed in 1 case.
AML-1/PEBP2alphaB/CBFA2 proteins participating in transcription are associated with the nuclear matrix.
Overexpression of an active form of GSK-3beta reduced Skp2 expression, increased p27 Kip1 in the nucleus and increased p27 Kip1 binding to CDK2.
The Drosophila Argos protein is the only known extracellular inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).
Spectrin, actin, protein 4.1, adducin, tropomyosin, dematin and p55 are the principal components of the membrane skeleton.
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are transmembrane receptor proteins that allow the transfer of signals across the cell membrane.
Smad proteins are the intracellular mediators of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling.
Aquaporin 2 (AQP2) phosphorylation at Ser-256 by protein kinase A (PKA) is a key signal for vasopressin-stimulated AQP2 insertion into the plasma membrane in renal cells.
Meiosis-specific cohesin complexes consist of two structural maintenance of chromosomes proteins (SMC1α/SMC1β and SMC3), an α-kleisin protein (RAD21, RAD21L, or REC8), and a stromal antigen protein (STAG1, 2, or 3).
Plasma-membrane cytochalasin B binding increased approximately 2-fold, whereas GLUT-4 protein concentration increased approximately 1.5-fold above control with contractions, insulin, or insulin + contraction.
OPC inhibited mitosis by decreasing intracellular levels of oxidative stress, regulating antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD, GPx, GR, and GST), mediating bcl-2 family proteins, and deactivating caspase-3.
