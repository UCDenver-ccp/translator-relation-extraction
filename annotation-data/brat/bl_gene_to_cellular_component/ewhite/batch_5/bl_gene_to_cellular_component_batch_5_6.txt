The Cdc42- and Rac-interactive binding motif (CRIB) of coronin binds to Rho GTPases with a preference for GDP-loaded Rac.
Either SPHK1 or SPHK2 silencing in RKO cells decreased phosphorylated Akt levels and increased p53 and p21 protein levels as well as (polyADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage in response to l-OHP treatment.
Further studies on the mechanism of antidepressant action on GR function revealed that protein kinase C, but not mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3) and protein kinase B (PKB, Akt) play a role in this phenomenon.
In vivo Mad3 phosphorylation depends on the Polo kinase Cdc5 and, to a minor extent, the Aurora B kinase Ipl1.
MAPK scaffold IQGAP1 binds the EGF receptor and modulates its activation.
We found that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) acts on gephyrin clustering through MAPK signaling, and this process may be controlled by the MAPK signaling antagonist sprouty2.
p38 MAPK (p38) plays pivotal roles in aging and reproductive physiology.
In addition, the anabolic LIPUS signal transduction to the nucleus via the integrin/phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase/Akt pathway rather than the integrin/MAPK pathway was generally associated with cell proliferation.
The most interesting combination was TLR2 or TLR4 agonists in combination with TLR7/8 or TLR8 agonists.
Preincubation with an antibody against growth hormone receptors blocked growth hormone- and placental lactogen-induced vasodilation.
Flt3 mutation activates p21WAF1/CIP1 gene expression through the action of STAT5.
Monoclonal antibodies to growth hormone and prolactin.
Phosphorylation of Ser5 and Ser7 by cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) as part of TFIIH marks initiation, whereas phosphorylation of Ser2 by CDK9 marks elongation.
Rhodopsin, the membrane protein responsible for dim-light vision, until recently was the only G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with a known crystal structure.
Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), which belongs to the EGF-family growth factors, is synthesized as a membrane-anchored form (proHB-EGF).
Although CA treatment decreased the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen?activated protein (MAP) kinase and p53, p38 MAP kinase inhibition by SB203580 did not affect SM?induced cell death.
Consistent with Foxo1 phosphorylation, Foxo1 protein was excluded from the nuclei in L6-mIRS1 cells, whereas Foxo1 was localized in the nuclei in control L6 cells during induction of differentiation.
[Insulin-like growth factors and growth hormone].
During 30-min EGF stimulation similar dynamics were found for RelA/p65 and IkB-a in the cytosol, RelA/p65 and p50 in the nucleus and p50 and IkB-a in the membrane.
However, E2F-1 was phosphorylated by cyclin A/CDK2 in vitro and was phosphorylated in vivo in HeLa cells.
