Moreover, TIMP-1 enhances specific phosphorylation of both Akt and Bad (Bcl-2/Bcl-X(L)-antagonist, causing cell death) in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner and, besides, controls the level of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-X(L).
Expression of PCSK9 normally downregulates the LDL-receptor pathway by indirectly causing degradation of LDL-receptor protein, and loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 result in low plasma LDL levels.
In addition, levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38MAPK correlated with tryptase levels.
Gamma-Secretase is responsible for proteolytic maturation of signaling and cell surface proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP).
Moreover, Reelin, a secreted protein regulating neuronal positioning, prevents FGFR degradation through N-Cadherin, causing Erk1/2 phosphorylation.
Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase and GEP100/Brag2 protein mediate antiangiogenic signaling by semaphorin 3E-plexin-D1 through Arf6 protein.
population through increased SMAD2/3 phosphorylation, suggesting that MMP9 directly activates TGF-??signaling in RPS14-deficient cells.
DP1 phosphorylation in multimeric complexes: weaker interaction with cyclin A through the E2F1 cyclin A binding domain leads to more efficient phosphorylation than stronger interaction through the p107 cyclin A binding domain.
Subsequently, the associations between EGFR expression, CXCR4 expression, EGFR/CXCR4 coexpression and clinicopathologic factors were assessed, and survival analyses were performed.
Role of leptin and leptin receptor in inflammation.
Sirt7 was positively regulated by MEG3 expression, and effects of MEG3 overexpression on U251 cells were ameliorated by Sirt7 silence.
These data demonstrate that Evi5 is a Rab11 binding protein and that Evi5 may cooperate with Rab11 to coordinate vesicular trafficking, cytokinesis, and cell cycle control independent of GTPase-activating protein function.
USP13 enzyme regulates Siah2 ligase stability and activity via noncatalytic ubiquitin-binding domains.
Here, we show that the MID1 protein also associates with elongation factor 1alpha (EF-1alpha) and several other proteins involved in mRNA transport and translation, including RACK1, Annexin A2, Nucleophosmin and proteins of the small ribosomal subunits.
Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) is the principal carrier protein of IGF-I in the circulation.
Mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are found at a frequency of 15 to 44% in Asian ADSC, and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are a more effective treatment for EGFR-mutated ADSC compared to chemotherapy.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase recently was identified as providing a link to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in response to G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists in Rat-1 fibroblasts.
Hybridization of matrix-bound MM-creatine kinase with BB-creatine kinase and arginine kinase.
Thus, OPN-/- cells migrate normally towards CSF-1 but not towards fMLP and MCP-1, which signal through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
SCF complexes, formed by Skp1, Cullin, and F-box proteins, act as protein-ubiquitin ligases.
