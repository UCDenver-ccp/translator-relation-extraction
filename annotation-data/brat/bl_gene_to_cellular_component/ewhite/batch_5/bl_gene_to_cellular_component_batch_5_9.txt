OCT, and the downregulation of Nrl and Crx gene expression confirmed that cell death occurs in 55% of photoreceptors via the up-regulation of caspase-3 and caspase-12, and the release of AIF1 from the mitochondria.
In mammalian cells the centrosome or diplosome is defined by the two parental centrioles observed in electron microscopy and by the pericentriolar material immunostained with several antibodies directed against various centrosomal proteins (gamma-tubulin, pericentrin, centrin and centractin).
Nitration of the mitochondrial complex I subunit NDUFB8 elicits RIP1- and RIP3-mediated necrosis.
This condensed chromatin structure is associated with binding of DNMT3B and decreased occupancy of OCT1 transcription factor at MAML2 enhancer, suggesting a role of DNMT3B in increasing methylation of MAML2 after stilbenoid treatment.
We established and validated an IL-1 beta assay measuring free and protein bound IL-1 beta; protein bound IL-1 beta was detached from the IL-1 beta specific binding protein by acidification, rendering it accessible for the employed antibody.
An age-dependent increase was observed for NADH dehydrogenase, the mitochondrial inner membrane protein mitofilin, peroxiredoxin isoform PRX-III, ATPase synthase, succinate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial fission protein Fis1, succinate-coenzyme A ligase, acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, porin isoform VDAC2, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core I protein and prohibitin.
Growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), a novel axonal phosphoprotein, is originally identified as a growth-cone-specific protein of developing neurons in vitro.
FRAP1/mTOR, ARAF1 and ROCK2), cytoskeleton (e.g.
Silencing of potential fibronectin receptor integrin α5 and integrin β1 decreased 786-O cell ability in movement and chemotactic migration.
These results suggested that the JNK cascade, not p38 kinase, cooperated with the Smad signaling to induce Smad7 transcription through the AP-1 element.
The antibody which elicits insulin action without activation of kinase activity of insulin receptors may induce conformational change of insulin receptors.
To further study the role of the FGF receptor (FGFR) during this translocation, the intracellular fate of FGFR-1 protein and enzymatic activity was examined.
Western blotting revealed an up-regulation of α3, α5, β3 and β4 integrins and down-regulation of the integrin β1 protein by VPA in TCCSUP.
Cdk2 and Cdk4 regulate the centrosome cycle and are critical mediators of centrosome amplification in p53-null cells.
The Smad signalling pathway is critical for transmitting transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily signals from the cell surface to the nucleus.
The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor is a heterodimer of two membrane proteins: calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1).
Concurrently, ox-LDL treatment enhanced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (P<0.05
EphA1 interacts with integrin-linked kinase and regulates cell morphology and motility.
The soluble leptin receptor (SLR) is the major, circulating, leptin-binding protein and, in vitro, the SLR inhibits leptin-binding to cell surface receptors.
Besides downregulating antiapoptotic protein expression of survivin and Mcl-1, CPT increased phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and inhibited phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2).
