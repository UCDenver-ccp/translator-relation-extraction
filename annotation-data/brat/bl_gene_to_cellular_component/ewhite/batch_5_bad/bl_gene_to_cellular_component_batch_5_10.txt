There were subtle differences in the protein targets of BQ and NQ, but both associated with the following abundant proteins, nucleophosmin, galectin-1, probable protein disulfide isomerase, protein disulfide isomerase, 60 kDa heat shock protein, mitochondrial stress-70 protein, epithelial cell marker protein, and S100-type calcium binding protein A14.
The pro-apoptotic protein Fas, FasL, Bax and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), Bcl-2 alpha were studied immunohistochemically by SP method.
Wnt5a regulates Shh and Fgf10 signaling during lung development.
Our data show that C. muridarum infection significantly increased STAT1 gene expression and protein activation in WT OE cells; however, TLR3-deficient OE cells showed diminished STAT1 protein activation and gene expression.
Moreover, Selenium nanoparticles activate Akt kinase by increasing its phosphorylation, promote Akt-dependent androgen receptor phosphorylation and Mdm2 regulated degradation through proteasome pathway.
Caspase-1 activation triggered by multiple nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs; NLRC4, NLRP1b, or NLRP3) leads to loss of lysosomes via their fusion with the cell surface, or lysosome exocytosis.
The Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27362 abolished elastase-stimulated sensitisation of TRPV4, which indicates that Rho-kinase signalling plays a critical role in PAR2-mediated TRPV4 sensitisation by the biased agonist neutrophil elastase.
In the search for proteins that could mediate the association of syndecan-2 with the actin cytoskeleton we found that ezrin, a protein which links membrane receptors to the cytoskeleton, coimmunoprecipitated with syndecan-2 in COS-1 cells.
Lactoferrin induces activation of p42/44 MAPK signaling as well as PI3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation of Akt in osteoblasts.
Our results indicate that p16 induces downregulation of cyclin A and CDK2, reduces the interaction between cyclin A and Sp1, and attenuates phosphorylation of Sp1.
The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is an important cell proliferation pathway.
Tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular integrin-dependent signalling proteins as well as the expression of key signalling protein Shc isoforms (p46, p52, p66), focal adhesion kinase, and extracellular matrix protein collagen type I were significantly enhanced when HBDC were grown on Al(2)O(3)-Mg(2+) compared to the native Al(2)O(3).
S100B (RAGE ligand) treatment in human THP-1 monocytic cells (THP-1) significantly increased gene expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1beta; chemokines MCP-1 and IP-10; adhesion factors platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1) and beta2-integrin; and pro-inflammatory cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).
Ubp8-mediated deubiquitination of Snf1 affects the stability and phosphorylation state of Snf1, thereby affecting Snf1 kinase activity.
TRIM72 negatively regulates myogenesis via targeting insulin receptor substrate-1.
CCRL2 inhibits p38 MAPK (p38) phosphorylation and up-regulates the expression of E-cadherin.
Epigenetic silencing of GST-M2 was distinguished from Sp1-mediated GST-M2 transcriptional expression.
Smad4 mediates signaling by the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of cytokines.
These results indicate that Hsp17.6CII is a peroxisome-localized catalase chaperone.
Finally, ARF6 also controlled MAPK (Erk1/2, p38 and Jnk) activation, a key pathway of VSMC proliferation.
