Balanced interactions of calcineurin with AKAP79 regulate Ca2+-calcineurin-NFAT signaling.
Ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM)-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50) is a versatile membrane-cytoskeleton linking protein that binds to the COOH-tail of specific integral membrane proteins through its two PDZ domains.
Overexpression of SETD2 upregulated the expression levels of a subset of p53 targets including puma, noxa, p53AIP1, fas, p21, tsp1, huntingtin, but downregulated that of hdm2.
After knockdown of EIF5A2 in HGC27 cells, E-cadherin levels were upregulated and vimentin, cyclin D1, cyclin D3, C-MYC and MTA1 levels were downregulated.
We have prepared a monoclonal antibody against a novel component protein of Glut4 vesicles and have identified this protein as cellugyrin, a ubiquitously expressed homologue of a major synaptic vesicle protein, synaptogyrin.
STAT6 binding to this site reduced TGF-beta1-mediated Foxp3 promoter activation and chromatin modification.
The Gi-coupled receptor-mediated increase in EGF receptor phosphorylation does not reflect increased EGF receptor autophosphorylation, assayed using an autophosphorylation-specific EGF receptor monoclonal antibody.
Under high glucose stress, Nmnat1 knockdown leads to p38-MAPK signaling inactivation.
Neuroleukin (NLK) is a multifunctional protein that stimulates cell growth and migration, together with its receptor autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR, also called gp78).
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) play key roles in regulating emergency granulopoiesis and inflammation, and are both negatively regulated by the inducible intracellular protein suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (Socs3).
This upregulation was related to Msx1 protein downregulation in cells expressing Msx1 sense mRNA.
In a cell-free system, tubulin, microtubule-associated protein 2, tau, fodrin, calmodulin-dependent kinase, calmodulin, and lipocortins 1 and 2 were reported to be good substrates for insulin-receptor kinase.
Early differentiating neurons expressed a number of transcription factors/chromatin remodeling proteins and synaptic proteins relevant to SZ pathogenesis, including ZNF804A, RELN, CNTNAP2, CTNNA2, SMARCA2, and NRXN1.
IkappaB kinase alpha and p65/RelA contribute to optimal epidermal growth factor-induced c-fos gene expression independent of IkappaBalpha degradation.
Regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 by S6 kinase 2.
Cell cycle G2/M phase-related genes were altered by BBR treatment: the expression of cyclin A1, cyclin B1, and Cdk1 were down-regulated, while Cdk4, p21, and p53 were up-regulated.
DNMT1 protein might regulate cell cycle events by mechanisms that are independent of its DNA methylation activity through its multiple protein-protein interactions.
The Arf-like protein Arl13b has been implicated in ciliogenesis and Sonic hedgehog signaling.
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) were activated in HbR-stimulated Ca9-22 cells.
Lipid metabolism emerged as the main altered function in patients, with HDL as a central node in the network analysis, interacting with downregulated proteins, such as APOA4, APOB, APOC1, APOL1, SAA4 and PON1.
