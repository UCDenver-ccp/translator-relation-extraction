STAT6-induced Th2 immunity was associated with up-regulated gene expression of MRC1, SOCS1 and TGFB in inflammatory foci, in comparison with adjacent tissue.
In addition, treatment with a TRPV1 antagonist suppressed morphine-induced increases in ?-opioid receptor binding, adenylyl cyclase 1 (AC1), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) expression in the DSt.
This rapid increase in nuclear PARylation is mediated by activation of PAR polymerase PARP-1 as a result of phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2.
In particular, Muc4/MUC4 can serve as a ligand/modulator of the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2, regulating its phosphorylation and the phosphorylation of its partner ErbB3, with or without the involvement of the ErbB3 ligand neuregulin.
After culture, the expression of very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and low-density lipoprotein-related protein-1 (LRP-1) were measured by real-time PCR.
We identified a novel extracellular heme-binding protein and named it neuferricin.
We reported that IL-6 transduces two signaling pathways via tyrosine redidues of the signal transducer gp130: one depends on signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-3 activation and the other on Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2)/Grb2 associated binder (Gab)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation.
Fibulin-5 is a novel binding protein for extracellular superoxide dismutase.
The results from these experiments indicate that CTB glycoprotein effectively protects against the allergic inflammation response, mainly through downregulation of MAPK/AP-1 in the mast cell degranulation stage.
Knocking down EZH2 expression suppresses the cell growth, cell cycle transition and cell invasion by downregulated E2F1 and MMP9, and upregulated tumor suppressor p21 expression.
Interleukin-6 increased but interleukin-1 decreased the mRNA and secretion of angiotensinogen, whereas both cytokines increased the secretion of both acute-phase proteins.
Gain-of function mutations in PCSK9 are autosomal dominant and cause hypercholesterolaemia because they increase the affinity of PCSK9 protein for the LDL receptor, whereas loss-of-function mutations reduce serum cholesterol because LDL-receptor protein is exposed to reduced PCSK9-mediated degradation.
TGF-beta 1 inhibited the growth of factor-dependent NFS-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner in response to IL-3, GM-CSF, G-CSF, CSF-1, IL-4, or IL-6.
The selected proteins fall into several groups, including acetylcholinesterase, glutamate racemase, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, lumazine synthase, human estrogen receptor alpha, dihydrofolate reductase and N-myristoyltransferase.
Biochip analysis showed that SWCNTs can induce up-regulation expression of cell cycle-associated genes such as p16, bax, p57, hrk, cdc42 and cdc37, down-regulation expression of cell cycle genes such as cdk2, cdk4, cdk6 and cyclin D3, and down-regulation expression of signal transduction-associated genes such as mad2, jak1, ttk, pcdha9 and erk.
We hypothesized that nucleophosmin (NPM), a nucleolar phosphoprotein, is critical for Bax-mediated cell death.
Sclerostin inhibits osteoblast differentiation without affecting BMP2/SMAD1/5 or Wnt3a/?-catenin signaling but through activation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor signaling in vitro.
Insulin regulation of fat cell ribosomes, protein synthesis, and lipoprotein lipase.
The aged muscle also manifested signs of impaired insulin signalling including attenuated phosphorylation of Akt, activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and membrane trafficking of GLUT4 and elevated levels of phosphorylated IRS1 and iNOS and apoptotic activation measured as Bim, p53 and apoptotic DNA fragmentation.
Ionizing radiation up-regulates cyclooxygenase-2 in I407 cells through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.
