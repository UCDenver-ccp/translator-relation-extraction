In OVCAR-3 and PC-3 cells, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin/p70S6K and p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways were required for LPA-induced HIF-1alpha and VEGF expressions, whereas only the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin/p70S6K pathway was important in SK-Hep1 cells.
Several potential phosphorylation sequence motifs were identified in the HPV 11 E1(wedge)E4 protein, including potential sites of phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), casein kinase II, and protein kinase C. To test phosphorylation of the HPV 11 E1(wedge)E4 protein, a soluble maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion was produced in Escherichia coli.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-controlled chemokines CXCL8/interleukin 8 (IL-8), CCL2/monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and CXCL10/interferon gamma-produced protein of 10?kDa (IP-10) were modulated by transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-?) and by the tumor necrosis factor alpha/interferon gamma combination (T/I).
-integrin and with NRP1.
Agonist activated adrenocorticotropin receptor internalizes via a clathrin-mediated G protein receptor kinase dependent mechanism.
TNFR1-stimulated p42/44 MAPK and p38 MAPK activities were insensitive to pharmacological caspase inhibition or CrmA.
A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of Clk3 catalyzed autophosphorylation of the kinase but not phosphorylation of the exogenous substrates histone or casein.
Regarding the intracellular signaling underlying the effect of EGCG, EGCG failed to affect PGF2??stimulated phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAPK, p38 MAPK or SAPK/JNK.
Thereafter, samples were compared for cell recruitment, adhesion, proliferation, and real-time PCR for osteoblast differentiation markers including Runx2, collagen 1 alpha 2 (COL1A2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and osteocalcin (OCN).
Smad family proteins function as intracellular signal transducers for TGF-beta that convey information from the cell membrane to the nucleus.
Furthermore, cells treated with TFSC significantly upregulated protein expressions in Notch, AKT and p38/MAPK signaling pathways.
PIC also activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and its downstream MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2).
The bradykinin receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is coupled to the Galpha(q) family of heterotrimeric G proteins.
With regard to proliferation-related signals, our finding indicated that SJSZ glycoprotein (50??g/ml) diminished the production of intracellular ROS, activity of phosphorylated ERK, p38 MAPK, NF-?B (p50 and p65), PCNA, and cyclin D1/CDK4 in MNNG-induced BNL CL.2 cells.
Interleukin-6 stimulates LDL receptor gene expression via activation of sterol-responsive and Sp1 binding elements.
Sortilin 1 (SORL1) is a transmembrane sorting receptor that regulates the intracellular trafficking of beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP).
The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAP kinase) is a signaling protein that is involved in transduction of extracellular signals including oxidative stress, growth factors, and cytokines, with diverse cellular consequences such as cell proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis.
The Cdk5-p35 kinase associates with the Golgi apparatus and regulates membrane traffic.
Expression of BMP2, alkaline phosphatase, type I collagen, osteonectin, osteopontin, and mineralization of the cells confirmed secretion of active BMP2.
EGF receptors were quantitated using the I-125 EGF-binding assay and that of EGF was quantitated using isotope labelled antibody to EGF.
