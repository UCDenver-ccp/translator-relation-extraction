Gefitinib also induces death of H4 cells with characteristics of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, including Bax mitochondrial translocation, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, cytochrome c cytosolic release, and caspase-9/caspase-3 activation.
ALBP is phosphorylated by the insulin receptor kinase upon insulin stimulation.
Moreover, menin represses ubiquitination of FOXO1 protein and AKT phosphorylation, We found that menin stabilizes FOXO1 by repressing FOXO1 degradation mediated by S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promoting caspase 3 activation and apoptosis.
ABCC2/Abcc2 harbors multiple binding sites and displays complex transport kinetics.
The LKB1-NUAK1 pathway controls mitochondria immobilization in axons.
A distinct set of peroxisomal proteins, including two ATPases, Pex1p and Pex6p, as well as phosphoinositide- and GTP-binding proteins, transiently associates with the cytosolic face of ECR domains.
Thus, Rab7 activation by the MON1-CCZ1 complex is critical for vacuolar trafficking, vacuole biogenesis, and plant growth.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; ErbB1, HER1 in humans) is a receptor tyrosine kinase triggering signals across the plasma membranes of cells to determine cell fate.
Role of Raf-1 and FAK in cell density-dependent regulation of integrin-dependent activation of MAP kinase.
Significantly upregulated genes included DUSP1, RHOB1, GADD45B, and RGS1.
beta-Adrenergic receptors and regulatory GTP-binding proteins: reconstitution of coupling in phospholipid vesicles.
Recombinant CDK9/cyclin T1, CDK9/cyclin T2a, and CDK9/cyclin T2b produced in Sf9 cells possessed DRB-sensitive kinase activity and functioned in transcription elongation in vitro.
Our data provide the first evidence for an RNA-binding protein playing a role in regulation of Smad-mediated transcriptional activity and suggest that RBPMS stimulates Smad-mediated transactivation possibly through enhanced phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 at the C-terminus and promotion of the nuclear accumulation of the Smad proteins.
Interestingly, the protein complex binding to the -134 site contains Smad4 in association with the homeodomain proteins Pbx1 and Prep1.
Ligand stimulation of the CXCR4 receptor resulted in sustained activation of Akt/protein kinase B and biphasic phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase in IGROV.
Inhibition of endogenous Src family kinase activity by cellular expression of a dominant negative kinase-inactive mutant of c-Src inhibits Gbeta1gamma2 subunit-mediated and Gi-coupled receptor-mediated phosphorylation of both EGF receptor and Shc.
With regard to the intracellular signaling in the TGF-?-stimulated VEGF synthesis, resveratrol and SRT1720 significantly attenuated the phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK stimulated by TGF-?; however, the TGF-?-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 and p38 MAP kinase was hardly affected by resveratrol or SRT1720.
Gastrin can evidently promote invasiveness of Colo320 cells via gastrin-gastrin receptor-FAK signal transduction pathway.
[Insulin resistance and insulin receptor defect in the aged].
We explore whether catalase (CAT) protein overexpression by adenoviral CAT gene (Adv-CAT) transfection may improve ischemia/reperfusion-induced renal dysfunction.
