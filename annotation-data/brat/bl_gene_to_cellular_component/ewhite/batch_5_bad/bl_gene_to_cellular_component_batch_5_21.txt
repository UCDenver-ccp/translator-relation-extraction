Immunoreactivities of the synaptic vesicle-associated proteins Rab3a and SNAP25 were also observed in the cells.
Exonucleolytic degradation of RNA by p53 protein in cytoplasm.
FGF-2 induced the phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT-1), a substrate of Rho-kinase.
Additionally, inhibition of chemerin down-regulated the expression of several proteins, including phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2, nuclear factor-kappa B p65, and proliferation cell nuclear antigen.
Interleukin-6 autocrine signaling mediates melatonin MT(1/2)  receptor-induced STAT3 Tyr(705)  phosphorylation.
Furthermore, we found that Nur77 induction is mediated through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.
Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) are critical for cell proliferation and differentiation.
Expression levels of apoptosis proteins caspase 9, caspase 3, PARP, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 were downregulated, while the expression level of apoptosis protein Bax was upregulated.
Spreds (Sprouty-related proteins with an Ena/Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology-1 domain) are a new protein family inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway.
The normoblastosis locus affects the spectrin binding protein called ankyrin.
Moreover, Msx2 inhibited Dkk1 promoter activity and reduced RNA polymerase association with Dkk1 chromatin.
TNF-alpha at 30 ng/ml significantly increased phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinase (175 kDa) and p42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase.
A cohort of 393 patients with aneurysms without mutation in FBN1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 was screened for mutations in SMAD3.
Up-regulation of homeodomain genes, DLX1 and DLX2, by FLT3 signaling.
These mutations are associated with hyperactivation of USP8 that prevent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation.
EGFR, phosphorylated EGFR, phosphorylated Akt, and survivin expressions were determined by immunoblotting.
It competed with EGF for binding to EGFR and inhibited EGFR activation and cell proliferation induced by this growth factor.
Furthermore, HPI-4 could distinctly disturb HH pathway-mediated ciliogenesis and suppress primary cilia-related protein intraflagellar transport protein IFT88 expression.
The HFM challenge did not up-regulate the expression of ERS markers (XBP1, HSPA5, EDEM1, DNAJC3 and ATF4) in either CD14? or CD14? cell populations, except for ATF3 (2?3-fold).
Induced GST-RGD fusion protein was purified via GST-Sepharose 4B affinity resin.
