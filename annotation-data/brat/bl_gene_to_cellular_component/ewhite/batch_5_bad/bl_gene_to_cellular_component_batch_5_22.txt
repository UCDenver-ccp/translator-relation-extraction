MGRN1-mediated ubiquitination of ?-tubulin regulates microtubule dynamics and intracellular transport.
Tyrosinase related protein-1 is a melanocyte specific protein and a member of the tyrosinase gene family which also includes tyrosinase and TRP 2 (DOPAchrome tautomerase).
Downregulated of endogenous MTA3 could promote apoptosis in NSCLC cells, meanwhile, siMTA3 could upregulate the protein of BAX, Cleved-Caspase-3, p-PARP, and dowmregulate the protein of Bcl-2.
Concurrent inhibition of EGFR, STAT3, and Src diminished the CSC subpopulation in an EGFR-mutation-positive cellular model.
Ectopic expression of either TERT or PTOP in SIRT1-depleted cells significantly restored cell proliferation.
Gene silencing of PKCdelta by RNA interference significantly suppressed the PGF2alpha-induced increase in NOX1 mRNA, as well as phosphorylation of the EGF receptor, ERK1/2 and ATF-1.
Despite this, overexpressed Fak56 is a potent inhibitor of integrins binding to the extracellular matrix, suggesting that Fak56 may play a subtle role in the negative regulation of integrin adhesion.
Tight junction protein ZO-1 controls organic cation/carnitine transporter OCTN2 (SLC22A5) in a protein kinase C-dependent way.
According to our analyses DGAT1, DGAT2, DGAT3 and WS/DGAT are very divergent genes and may have distinct origin in plants.
Up-regulation of human WOX1, isoform WOX2, and Tyr33 phosphorylation occurred during normal keratinocyte differentiation before cornification and death.
LRRK2 is a large protein with a kinase domain, a GTPase domain, and multiple potential protein interaction domains.
The LPS-induced phosphorylation of MAP kinases was also attenuated by PL; significant changes were observed in the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2, JNK and p38 MAPK.
Proliferation-associated POU4F2/Brn-3b transcription factor expression is regulated by oestrogen through ER? and growth factors via MAPK pathway.
Jab1/CSN5 is a multifunctional protein that plays an important role in integrin signaling, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and the regulation of genomic instability and DNA repair.
The increased levels of p21 were associated with increased binding of p21 and Cdk2 concomitant with marked decrease in Cdk2 and cyclin E-dependent kinase activities with no changes in Cdk2 and cyclin E expression.
It enhanced the expression of key proteins and enzymes, including insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate, PI3K, phosphorylated-AKT, hepatic kinase, GLUT4, glycogen synthase, GSK3?, GLK, PFK1, PKM2, and AMPK?, which are related to insulin metabolism and glycolysis.
Moreover, neuritin significantly suppressed Notch ligand Jagged1 (JAG1) endocytosis promoted by NEURL1, and then inhibited the activation of Notch receptor Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and decreased the expression of downstream gene hairy and enhancer of split-1 (HES1).
F2 not only mediated Frizzled8, p?LRP6 and LRP6 expression, but also downregulated the phosphorylation of GSK3?, and concurrently decreased the nucleus protein expression of MMP2, MMP3, MMP7, MMP9, and c?Myc.
Using Dok-1 knockout cells and Dok-1 mutants deficient in binding to specific Dok-1-interacting proteins, we show that Dok-1 interferes with PDGF-stimulated c-myc induction and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation by tethering different signaling components to the cell membrane.
Furthermore, the MEK [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/Erk1/2]/Erk1/2 inhibitor U0126 also inhibited EGF-induced AQP8 expression and cell migration.
