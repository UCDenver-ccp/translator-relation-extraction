Intracellular ANKRD1 protein levels are regulated by 26S proteasome-mediated degradation.
HPS could down-regulate bcl-2 protein expression and up-regulate Bax protein expression.
Insulin stimulates glucose transport by promoting translocation of GLUT4 proteins from the perinuclear compartment to the cell surface.
The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway regulates multiple steps of hematopoiesis, mediated through receptor-regulated Smads, including Smad1 and Smad5.
Androgen receptor silences thioredoxin-interacting protein and competitively inhibits glucocorticoid receptor-mediated apoptosis in pancreatic ?-Cells.
In addition, exogenous addition of BMP7 to TGF-beta-stimulated MDA-231 cells inhibited Smad-mediated TGF-beta signaling.
Regulation of elongation factor 2 kinase by p90(RSK1) and p70 S6 kinase.
[Glycophorin and membrane surface proteins].
Their integrin binding was measured by protein interaction ELISAs.
OEA also inhibits insulin-dependent MAPK pathway, as assessed by immunoblot of phosphorylated MEK and MAPK.
The schwannomin (also termed merlin) protein encoded by the NF2 gene shows a close relationship to the family of cytoskeleton-to-membrane proteins linkers ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin proteins).
Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the phosphotyrosine-containing proteins included focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen activated protein kinase.
Tpx2 is a microtubule-associated protein that activates the cell-cycle kinase Aurora A and regulates the mitotic spindle.
Here, we found that Tec1 and Ste12 can associate with the transcriptional coregulators Msa1 and Msa2 (Msa1/2), which were previously found to associate with the cell cycle transcription factor complexes SBF (Swi4/Swi6 cell cycle box binding factor) and MBF (Mbp1/Swi6 cell cycle box binding factor) to control G1-specific transcription.
In vitro, lapatinib inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR, HER2, and downstream signaling proteins; cell proliferation; and migration in 231-BR cells (both with and without HER2).
Rosiglitazone treatment impaired TNF-alpha activation of p38 and p42/p44MAPK, restoring insulin signalling and leading to normalisation of glucose uptake.
Transmembrane proteins with extracellular Frizzled domain, such as ROR1, ROR2, MUSK, MFRP, FZD1, FZD2, FZD3, FZD4, FZD5, FZD6, FZD7, FZD8, FZD9 and FZD10, are key molecules for WNT signaling network.
Two of these genes, CLN1 and CLN2, encode lysosomal enzymes: palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) and tripetidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1), respectively.
Inhibition of TASK-1 via activation of the PAF receptor is protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent.
Why clozapine is uniquely effective is unknown, but we have previously postulated may involve G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (ErbB1) transactivation signaling to the mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal regulated kinase (MAPK-ERK) cascade.
