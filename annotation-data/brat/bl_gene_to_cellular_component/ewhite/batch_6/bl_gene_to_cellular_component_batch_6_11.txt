The RanBP2/RanGAP1*SUMO1/Ubc9 complex is a multisubunit SUMO E3 ligase.
In HepG2, the SDF/CXCR4 interaction did not result in calcium influx, phosphorylation and internalization of CXCR4, nor in a rapid phosphorylation of p44/42 MAP kinase.
Using this technique and PRD1 as a model, we identified the known PRD1 multiprotein vertex structure composed of penton protein P31, spike protein P5, receptor-binding protein P2 and stabilizing protein P16 linking the vertex to the internal membrane.
DISC1 is located in several subcellular domains, such as the centrosome and the nucleus, and interacts with various proteins, including NudE-like (NUDEL/NDEL1) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)/CREB2.
Contrast between sn-1 and sn-2 DAG lactones in binding to protein kinase C.
Bax, a death-promoting protein, was upregulated and Bcl-x(L), a death-inhibiting protein, was downregulated.
The intracellular factor Smad4 plays a pivotal role in mediating TGF-beta/BMP signal transduction in the nucleus.
C. concisus ZOT also induced upregulation of TLR3, pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6, IL8 and chemokine CXCL16, as well as the executioner caspase CASP7.
DNMT1 maintains methylation patterns, while DNMT3A and DNMT3B are critical for de novo DNA methylation.
The EWSR1 gene rearrangement was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), but molecular biology failed to detect EWSR1/ETS, EWSR1/NR4A3, EWSR1/DDIT3, EWSR1/ATF1, EWSR1-POU5F1, EWSR1/ZNF444, EWSR1-PBX1 gene fusions.
Microglia-specific localisation of a novel calcium binding protein, Iba1.
At day 10 post wounding, AVP inhibited MMP-3 gene expression, while afterwards MMP-3 gene expression was upregulated.
In mitotically dividing vertebrate cells, the primary proteins involved in homologous recombination repair are RAD51 and the five RAD51 paralogs, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2, and XRCC3.
This is because the two subunits negatively regulate one another; GPI19 mutants show up-regulation of GPI2, whereas GPI2 mutants show up-regulation of GPI19.
PINCH1 and PINCH2 interact, through their first LIM domain, with the integrin-linked kinase and thereby link integrins with several signal transduction pathways.
We found differential gene expression of chymase (CMA1), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP3, MMP7), and upregulation of MMP14 and tissue inhibitors (TIMP1 and TIMP2) in BPH.
It has been reported that G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation induces epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) transactivation through the shedding of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF).
Thus, PAI-1 and PN-1 induce cell detachment through two slightly different mechanisms that affect integrin metabolism.
In A549 and H322 cells, which express a detectable amount of EGF-R (ErbB-1), ErbB-2, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4 receptors, the LA1 mAb induces up-regulation of the E-cadherin/catenin complex (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-catenins).
The E3-ubiquitin ligase TRIM50 interacts with HDAC6 and p62, and promotes the sequestration and clearance of ubiquitinated proteins into the aggresome.
