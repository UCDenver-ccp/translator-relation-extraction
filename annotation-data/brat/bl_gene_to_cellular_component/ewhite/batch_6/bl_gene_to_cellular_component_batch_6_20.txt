PARP-1 inhibition increases mitochondrial metabolism through SIRT1 activation.
The novel tight junction protein marvelD3 contains a conserved MARVEL (MAL and related proteins for vesicle trafficking and membrane link) domain like occludin and tricellulin.
In response to an apoptotic stimulus, Bax and Bak change conformation, leading to Bax accumulation at mitochondria and Bak/Bax oligomerization to form a pore in the mitochondrial outer membrane that is responsible for cell death.
Membrane glycoprotein PC-1 inhibits insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase activity and subsequent cellular signaling.
Specific cross-linking of this KAR with a monoclonal antibody resulted in intracellular calcium mobilization, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and phosphorylation of the MAP kinases, ERK1 and ERK2.
These data indicate that integrin heterodimer composition and CD24 expression differentially modulate integrin binding to domains 1 and 4 of VCAM-1.
Dopamine, SKF 38393, and quinpirole increased the level of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), p38 MAPK, and stress-activated protein kinase/Jun-N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) phosphorylation.
Recently, compelling evidence has been presented regarding agonistic antibodies directed against the alpha-adrenergic receptor, the beta-adrenergic receptors, the angiotensin II AT1 receptor, and the platelet-derived growth factor-alpha receptor.
Signaling pathways mediated by the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase/MAP kinase cascade.
cytochrome P450 2c11 (Cyp2c11), Cyp4a2, glutathione S-transferases mu 2 (Gstm2), and Slc22a8 (organic anion transporter 3, Oat3).
It was observed that p38 MAP kinase (MAPK) was activated soon after the treatment followed by over-expression of Bax protein in cells undergoing apoptosis.
Up-regulation of CDK2 and CDK4 and down-regulation of cell cycle inhibitors p16 and p21 were observed after the delivery of STC2.
RNAi -mediated silencing of CLDN6 downregulated both GSTP1 expression and GST enzyme activity in MCF-7/MDR cells.
Previous studies suggest a differential role for p38 mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) during wound healing; whereby, p38 MAPK acts as a growth kinase during normal wound healing, but acts as a stress kinase during diabetic wound repair.
On reaching the endosomal-lysosomal compartment, the beta-galactosidase protein associates with the protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA) and neuraminidase proteins to form the lysosomal multienzyme complex (LMC).
The mechanisms behind these effects include antioxidation, anti-apoptosis, vasodilation, inflammation regulation, lipidemia control, etc., through the PI3K/Akt-ERK1/2/Nrf2/HO-1, Bcl-2/Bax, eNOS and other molecular signaling pathways.
The deletion mutation can suppress kindlin-2 binding to integrin ?3, thereby partially inhibit the integrin ?3 signaling.
-terminal protein kinases (JNKs), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in VSMCs were detected via Western blotting.
Interaction of cells with extracellular matrix proteins or cytokines promote cell migration through activation of the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 as well as the molecular coupling of the adaptor proteins p130CAS and c-CrkII.
Conversely, the blocking of VEGFC/VEGFR3 signaling by VEGFR3 knockdown reduced the phosphorylation of AKT/MAPK and decreased the levels of cyclin D1 and PCNA.
