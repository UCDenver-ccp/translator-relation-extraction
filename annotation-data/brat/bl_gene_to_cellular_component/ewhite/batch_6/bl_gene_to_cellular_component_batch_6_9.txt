Inhibition of USP34 in NMuMG cells induced EMT, as evidenced by the upregulation of EMT markers including N-cadherin, phospho-Smad3, Snail and active-?-catenin, as well as the downregulation of Axin 1 and E-cadherin.
Adiponectin upregulated TSC2 expression and downregulated mTOR and S6K1 phosphorylation in ?-GP-treated VSMCs.
Differential activation of adenylyl cyclase by protein kinase C isoenzymes.
This work combines sequences of different promoters, STRESS-proteins, heat shock protein (HSP), kinase proteins, alcohol dehydrogenase protein (ADH), ribosomal binding sites, fluorescent reporter proteins, terminators, and a synthetic ribosomal switch.
The effect of EGF was abolished by inhibiting alpha 2 integrins with specific antibodies, indicating that part of the mechanism for the increase in cell motility and accelerated wound closure depends on alpha 2 integrin functional expression.
-containing vacuoles, marked by LGALS8/galectin-8, engage the cargo receptor CALCOCO2/NDP52 to recruit the autophagy-initiating ULK and TBK1 complexes and cause the formation of WIPI2-positive phagophore membranes.
Knock down of TRIM11 inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of GBM cells, significantly decreased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) levels and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, and downregulated HB-EGF (heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor) mRNA levels.
Thus, an FRS2?-CIN85/CD2AP-Cbl axis for downregulation of ErbB2 may regulate ErbB2 protein levels in physiological and pathological settings.
Here, using baculoviral co-expression of the DDR2 cytosolic domain and Src, we show that Src targets three tyrosine residues (Tyr-736, Tyr-740, and Tyr-741) in the activation loop of DDR2 for phosphorylation.
CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C belong to a family of protein phosphatases which activate the cyclin-dependent kinase at different points of the cell cycle.
Moreover, STAT3 phosphorylation was similarly inhibited in lines expressing Jak1 wherein Jak1 was phosphorylated upon IL-6 stimulation and Jak1 phosphorylation was not inhibited by U0126.
Among the proteins identified was glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which has recently been shown to affect insulin receptor signaling.
EGF, which failed to induce cell scattering, caused a short-term increase in the phosphorylation of Erk1/Erk2 MAP kinases.
In addition, p38 MAPK was activated downstream of Ark and Rac, and inhibition of p38 MAPK with either SB203580 or adenoviral dominant negative p38alpha also blocked Gas6/Ark-mediated migration.
Gi-mediated activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway involves a 100 kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated Grb2 SH3 binding protein, but not Src nor Shc.
MYPT1 is phosphorylated at multiple sites by several kinases, which regulate phosphatase activity, protein-protein interactions and subcellular localization.
Treatment with the synthetic LXR agonist T0901317 (T09) upregulated ABCA1 expression and apoAI-mediated cellular lipid release in ABCA1-transfected HEC293 cells, but ABCA7 expression and cellular lipid release in ABCA7-transfected HEC293 cells showed no obvious changes.
Semapimod treatment led to a significant decrease of p38-MAPK phosphorylation in macrophages; proinflammatory gene expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1; and neutrophil infiltration.
Lithium treated cells showed increased anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 and decreased pro-apoptotic protein BAX expression.
Furthermore, stroma attachment resulted in shortening of the G(1) phase of cell cycle, significant increases cdk2 activity, degradation of cdk inhibitor p27-GST protein, and decrease in levels of p27(Kip1) protein.
