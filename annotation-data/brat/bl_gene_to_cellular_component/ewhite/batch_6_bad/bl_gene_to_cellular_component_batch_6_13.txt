Experiments that used a MAPK inhibitor, p53 mutant cell lines, p53 inhibitor and p53 shRNA showed a decrease in FOXP3 levels, suggesting that p53 is required for UV-induced FOXP3 transcription.
We conclude that pericentrin forms complexes with CHD3 and CHD4, but a distinct CHD3-pericentrin complex is required for centrosomal anchoring of pericentrin/gamma-tubulin and for centrosome integrity.
Levels of ROS, phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), pro-inflammatory cytokines and collagen content in the left ventricle (LV) and LV function were measured and compared.
Bradykinin induced a concentration- and time-dependent induction of COX-2 protein in HNSCC, which was preceded by phosphorylation of EGFR and MAPK.
However, both ectopic overexpression and siRNA-mediated knockdown of CAND1 decreased the ability of Keap1 to target Nrf2 for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, resulting in stabilization of Nrf2 and activation of Nrf2-dependent gene expression.
ADP ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) acts through FilGAP protein to down-regulate Rac protein and regulates plasma membrane blebbing.
NMR structure of CXCR3 binding chemokine CXCL11 (ITAC).
GST-AQP0-C also interacted with a purified recombinant filensin-tail peptide after cleavage from GST.
The 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) is cosynthesized and co-purifies with the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor and is thought to modulate ligand binding to LRP.
This strategy revealed cooperation between the MAP kinase (MAPK) inducible transcription factor AP-1 and RUNX1 as a major driver of a common, FLT3-ITD-specific gene expression and chromatin signature, demonstrating a major impact of MAPK signaling pathways in shaping the epigenome of FLT3-ITD AML.
HGF phosphorylated USFs through MAPK and tyrosine kinase pathways.
Our results indicate that the role of EGFR in signalling by growth hormone is to be phosphorylated by Jak2, thereby providing docking sites for Grb2 and activating MAP kinases and gene expression, independently of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR.
MLL5 appears to lack intrinsic histone methyl transferase activity, but regulates expression of histone-modifying enzymes LSD1 and SET7/9, suggesting an indirect mechanism.
We demonstrate that RHF1a directly interacts with and targets a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor ICK4/KRP6 (for Interactors of Cdc2 Kinase 4/Kip-related protein 6) for proteasome-mediated degradation.
Life without acetylcholinesterase: the implications of cholinesterase inhibitor toxicity in AChE-knockout mice.
2----3SPG did not affect insulin binding to the insulin receptor.
It is a substrate for phosphorylation by p34cdc2 kinase, protein kinase C and nuclear kinase II, and a repressor of the transcriptional regulating activities of both the IRF-1 tumor suppressor protein and the YY1 transcription factor.
Alpha2-HSG, a specific inhibitor of insulin receptor autophosphorylation, interacts with the insulin receptor.
To dissect the molecular basis of integrin-dependent Egr-1 regulation, we show by FLIM-based FRET that in living cells beta1-integrin associates with the EGF receptor (EGFR) and that EGF further increases the extent complex formation.
Chromosomal passenger proteins including Aurora B, Survivin, and Borealin/Dasra B, also called CDCA8/FLJ10468, are known to play crucial roles during mitosis and cell division.
