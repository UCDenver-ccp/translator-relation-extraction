We investigated whether Smad, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and integrin signaling pathways cross-talk to enhance adventitial fibroblast (AF) bioactivity, which was activated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and inhibited by Gax.
Expressions of activated caspase-3 and caspase-8, Sod2, and inflammation-related proteins as well as p38 phosphorylation were significantly upregulated in the ischemia-injured rats.
The cytosolic protein talin induces an intermediate affinity integrin alphaLbeta2.
Indeed, transfection with HIF-1? and HIF-1? expression constructs upregulated DNASE1.
CCPA and H(2)O(2) activated p38 MAPK and p44/p42 ERKs in cytosolic fractions.
Mechanistically, Nanolipolee-007 inhibited PI3K/Akt, STAT3, and MAPK signaling mediated through inhibition of cholesterol transport.
Epertinib (S-222611) is a potent, reversible, and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human EGFR2 (HER2), and human EGFR4.
Nurr1 nuclear receptor related 1, TH tyrosine hydroxylase, NF-?B nuclear factor ?B, TNF? tumor necrosis factor alpha, ILs interleukins, GSK-3? glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta, SIRT-1 sirtuin 1.
Rac and Cdc42 appear to regulate a protein kinase cascade initiated at the level of PAK and leading to activation of p38 MAPK, since IL-4 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and increases its catalytic activity.
miR-191 modulates B-cell development and targets transcription factors E2A, Foxp1, and Egr1.
Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein mediates apolipoprotein E inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration.
An intracellular motif of GLUT4 regulates fusion of GLUT4-containing vesicles.
DNA damage-enhanced upregulation and chromatin binding of Cdc6 appeared to be due to downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) as Cdk1 knockdown increased Cdc6 levels.
A proteomic interaction screen identified Vpr binding protein (VprBP) as novel binding partner of I-Smad7.
Moreover, SNHG12 silencing suppressed MAPK1 and MAP2K1 expression by upregulating miR-181a, leading to inhibition of the MAPK/Slug pathway through decreasing phosphorylated MAPK1 (p-MAPK1), phosphorylated MAP2K1 (p-MAP2K1) and Slug levels.
CNPV genes lacking homologues in FWPV encode proteins similar to ubiquitin, interleukin-10-like proteins, tumor necrosis factor receptor, PIR1 RNA phosphatase, thioredoxin binding protein, MyD116 domain proteins, circovirus Rep proteins, and the nucleotide metabolism proteins thymidylate kinase and ribonucleotide reductase small subunit.
A glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of the WNK1 kinse domain phosphorylated itself and a substrate protein, as reported previously.
Because phosphorylation of p53 is critical for regulating its activity and LRRK2 is a kinase, we tested whether p53 is phosphorylated by LRRK2.
In addition, the exposure of HepG2 cells to high glucose concentrations impaired the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt2 Ser474 and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) Ser612, increased GSK-3? phosphorylation, and upregulated G6Pase and PEPCK expression.
BTC induced phosphorylation of all four EGF receptors present on HTASMCs: ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4.
