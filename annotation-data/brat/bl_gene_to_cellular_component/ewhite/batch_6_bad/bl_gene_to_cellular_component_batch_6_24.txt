LRRK2 kinase inhibition prevents pathological microglial phagocytosis in response to HIV-1 Tat protein.
The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is a transmembrane protein that plays a key role in cholesterol metabolism.
There is an increasing body of experimental evidence implicating the mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated-kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1/2 MAPK) in these events.
EGF receptor was also induced by its ligand EGF.
PAX3/FOXO1A or PAX7/FOXO1A did not inhibit the transcriptional activity of MyoD by perturbing MyoD expression, localization, phosphorylation or interaction with E-proteins.
We also demonstrate upregulation of activated p38 and ERK1/2 MAP kinases in axons within these neuromas.
Therefore, it is suggested that SGK1 inhibits MEKK3-MKK3/6 signal transduction by phosphorylation of MEKK3.
In transfected MCF-7 cells, 125I-labeled insulin binding and IR content were unchanged, and PC-1 overexpression did not influence IGF-1 stimulation of IGF-1 receptor autophosphorylation.
Phagosomes from p110? knock down cells showed normal acquisition of both Rab5 and EEA-1, but were markedly deficient in the lysosomal markers LAMP-1 and LAMP-2, and the lysosomal hydrolase, ?-galactosidase.
The EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p185 and of the EGF receptor occurred with similar kinetics and EGF dose-responses, and both phosphorylations were prevented by down-regulation of the EGF receptor with EGF.
GPR109A protein is mainly located in the cell membrane and cytoplasm.
We found that FAB1 predominantly localizes on the Sorting Nexin1 (SNX1)-residing late endosomes, and a loss of FAB1 function causes the release of late endosomal proteins, Ara7, and SNX1 from the endosome membrane, indicating that FAB1, or its product PtdIns(3,5)P2, mediates the maturation process of the late endosomes.
BMPs activate BMP-specific Smads, Smad1, 5 and 8. Smad proteins undergo multimerization with co-mediator Smad, Smad4, and translocated into the nucleus to regulate the transcription of target genes in cooperation with nuclear cofactors.
PAPP-A, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1), and superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD-2) levels were measured using spectrometric methods.
Like FREB1, FREB2 is expressed as an intracellular protein.
Moreover, 3-OMS abolished platelet aggregation, IKK?, and p38 MAPK phosphorylation stimulated by PAR4-AP (a PAR4 agonist) but not by PAR1-AP (a PAR1 agonist).
In contrast, inhibitors of JAK2, phospholipase C, protein kinase C and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II did not affect the ability of NGF to activate p38 MAPK.
In the present study, we show that peptides corresponding to the MAPK-docking sites of MEK1, MEK2, Ste7, Elk-1 and MAPK phosphatase (MKP)-2 potently inhibit MEK2 phosphorylation of ERK2, ERK2 phosphorylation of Elk-1, and MKP-1 dephosphorylation of ERK2.
Collectively, our findings are consistent with the following mechanism for Src-dependent DDR2 activation and signaling: 1) ligand binding promotes phosphorylation of Tyr-740 in the DDR2 activation loop by Src; 2) Tyr-740 phosphorylation stimulates intramolecular autophosphorylation of DDR2; 3) DDR2 autophosphorylation generates cytosolic domain phosphotyrosines that promote the formation of DDR2 cytosolic domain-Shc signaling complexes.
X11/Mint family members associate with a broad spectrum of membrane proteins, including Alzheimer's ?-amyloid precursor protein (APP), alcadeins, and low density lipoprotein receptor proteins, as well as various cytoplasmic proteins including Arf, kalirin-7, and Munc18.
