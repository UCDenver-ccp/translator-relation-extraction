Strain imposed during the systolic phase selectively activated p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase (MEK1/2, an activator of p44/42 MAPK) compared with strain imposed during the diastolic phase.
Inhibition of beta 2 integrin receptor and Syk kinase signaling in monocytes by the Src family kinase Fgr.
Alpha4 integrin binding interfaces on VCAM-1 and MAdCAM-1.
Rab21 activity, integrin-Rab21 association, and integrin endocytosis are all necessary for normal cytokinesis, which becomes impaired when integrin-mediated adhesion at the cleavage furrow fails.
Moreover, NLRP1 upregulated the protein levels of Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 in nuclei of fibroblasts, and attenuated levels of phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 in the cytoplasm of fibroblasts induced by TGF-?1.
Targeted inhibition of the Shroom3-Rho kinase protein-protein interaction circumvents Nogo66 to promote axon outgrowth.
Furthermore, the bone morphogenetic protein receptor-Smad (BMPR-Smad) signaling axis and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) were activated.
Alpha 4 integrin antagonists.
p38 MAPK phosphorylation of Gp78 S538 therefore regulates Gp78-dependent ER-mitochondria association and mitochondria motility.
Subcellular localisation experiments demonstrate that the At2g34450 protein is a nuclear protein, whereas the At5g23405 protein is found mainly in the cytoplasm.
Downregulation of BRIP1, a physiological partner of BRCA1 in the DNA repair pathway, triggers BRCA1 chromatin dissociation.
The role of Cdc42 in regulating E-cadherin ubiquitination and degradation is underscored by the fact that constitutively active Cdc42(F28L) increases the activity of EGFR and Src and significantly enhances E-cadherin ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation.
Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting.
To express the GST fusion protein, GST-Syntenin1 in E. coli, and to prepare the polyclonal antibody of Syntenin1.
Upon epidermal growth factor receptor activation, Cbl-yellow fluorescent protein moved with epidermal growth factor receptor to clathrin-coated pits and endosomes.
Ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM)-binding phosphoprotein 50 organizes ERM proteins at the apical membrane of polarized epithelia.
Integrin-related signalling, EGFr, Akt, p70S6kinase and ERK1/2 activation were determined.
These 9 Ags include EGFR, HER2, TfR, and integrin ?6?4.
The Rho family of small GTPases, including Cdc42, Rac, and Rho, regulates the actin cytoskeleton.
The PEX19 protein binds peroxisome TA proteins in the cytoplasm and delivers them to the membrane through the PEX3 receptor protein.
