Identification and functional analysis of Zranb2 as a novel Smad-binding protein that suppresses BMP signaling.
According to the results of Smad1 and Smad6 phosphorylation, immobilized naringin on ozonated chitosan substrates would be able to initiate bone morphogenetic protein-Smad signaling by activating receptor Smad and by suppressing inhibitory Smad.
The BMP-Smad inhibitor, dorsomorphin, inhibited phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, and blocked hESC differentiation to CD34+CD31+ progenitor cells, suggesting that BMP Smad-dependent signaling is critical for CD34+CD31+ vascular progenitor development.
Here we show that nonactivated Smad3, but not Smad2, undergoes proteasome-dependent degradation due to the concerted action of the scaffolding protein Axin and its associated kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3-beta).
Induction of the endoplasmic reticulum stress proteins GRP78, GRP94, calreticulin and protein disulfide isomerase was assessed by immunoblotting.
Extrinsic microenvironmental regulatory mechanisms include angiopoietin-1, TGF-?, bone morphogenic protein, thrombopoietin, N-cadherin, and integrin adhesion receptors; Wnt/?-catenin signaling; and osteopontin.
S1P influences EOC invasion by regulating ECM-proteolysis and cell-cell attachment via MMP2, uPA, and membrane-N-cadherin.
In DLD-1, Crb3 showed membranous localization of FGFR1 leading to its functional activation, whereas Crb3 bound to cytoplasmic FGFR4 in WiDr without FGFR1 expression, leading to cellular growth.
Akt phosphorylation induced by recombinant Wisp2/CCN5 was suppressed after knockdown of integrin ?1.
During spindle morphogenesis, TPX2 cooperates with Aurora A kinase and Eg5 kinesin to regulate microtubule organization.
mRNA expression of KIF1A, KIF1B, KIF2, KIF3A, KIF3B, KIF4, KIF5, and cytoplasmic dynein during axonal regeneration.
Depletion of Nischarin or the Nischarin binding partners--Rac1, Rab14 and Rab9 GTPases--reduced the intracellular growth of Salmonella.
Protein expression of phosphorylated Smad2 (p-Smad2, cytosolic and nuclear), Smad7, phosphorylated ERK1 (p-ERK1), phosphorylated ERK2 (p-ERK2), and phosphorylated p38 MAPK (p-p38 MAPK) was measured using Western blotting.
Receptor regulated-Smad (R-Smad) proteins specific for the BMP pathways interact with various proteins, including transcription factor Runx, and transmit specific signals in target cells.
YAP1 overexpression activated Smad-dependent BMP signaling and slightly inhibited Erk1/2 signaling pathway activity.
Glutathione suppresses TGF-beta-induced PAI-1 expression by inhibiting p38 and JNK MAPK and the binding of AP-1, SP-1, and Smad to the PAI-1 promoter.
Kindlin-1 binds to integrins and regulates integrin activation at cell adhesions.
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are 7-transmembrane proteins that transduce various extracellular signals into intracellular pathways.
Bradykinin also enhanced insulin stimulated GLUT4 translocation from the intracellular fraction to the cell membrane, and insulin induced phosphorylation of the insulin receptor beta subunit and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) without affecting the binding affinities or numbers of cell surface insulin receptors in dog adipocytes.
Tyrphostins did not alter cell surface display of EGF-receptor, EGF binding or EGF-induced internalization, degradation, and down-regulation of EGF receptors.
