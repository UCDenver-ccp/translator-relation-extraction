EMD promoted gene expression of various osteoblast differentiation markers including a number of collagen types and isoforms, SMAD intracellular proteins, osteopontin, cadherin, alkaline phosphatase, and bone sialoprotein.
Here we investigate the cell cycle dependence of telomere binding by each of the seven Tetrahymena thermophila telomerase holoenzyme proteins TERT, p65, Teb1, p50, p75, p45, and p19.
These results suggest that KLF4-dependent regulation of Smad and p38 MAPK signaling via TbetaRI requires prior phosphorylation of KLF4 through Smad and p38 MAPK pathways.
The integrin family of heterodimeric cell adhesion molecules exists in both low- and high-affinity states, and integrin activation requires binding of the talin FERM (four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain to membrane-proximal sequences in the beta-integrin cytoplasmic domain.
HER2/neu protein showed membrane localization.
Those include classic estrogen receptors ERalpha and ERbeta, novel membrane proteins that behave as estrogen receptors such as GPR30, ion channels, and other ligand receptors.
These particulates contain tubulin, neurofilament, spectrin, MAP2, and other as yet unidentified proteins.
The alpha -chains of C4b-binding protein mediate complex formation with low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein.
Insulin and the phosphorylation of intracellular proteins.
We also looked at some ER [calnexin, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activity] and lysosomes (Lamp1) markers during EP.
Application of anti-BDNF blocking antibody or mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase inhibitor, attenuated depolarization-supported survival, implicating canonical BDNF/TrkB signaling.
Structurally homologous ligand binding of integrin Mac-1 and viral glycoprotein C receptors.
Endothelial cells formed dense monolayers with uniform cell size, tight intercellular junctions, and expression of voltage-dependent anion channels VDAC2 and VDAC3, chloride channel protein CLCN2, and sodium bicarbonate transporter NBC1.
Smad6 and Smad7, are potent antagonists of the BMP-Smad pathway by interacting with activated bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptors and thereby preventing the activation of receptor-regulated Smads, or by competing with activated R-Smads for heteromeric complex formation with Smad4.
In erbB-2-overexpressing and in constitutively active Rac 1-expressing cells, a p38MAP kinase (p38MAPK) inhibitor blocked invasiveness and reversed alpha(4) integrin downregulation.
Rac-dependent intracellular stiffening involved its binding partner lamellipodin, a protein that transmits Rac signals to the cytoskeleton during cell migration.
Mechanistically, PARP1 interacts with STAT3 and retains active phosphorylated-STAT3 in nucleus.
Transfection of wild-type LIMK1 accelerates axon formation and enhances the accumulation of Par3/Par6, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)1 receptors, and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) at growth cones, while inhibiting the Golgi export of synaptophysin-containing vesicles.
receptor antibody, anti-LGI1 antibody, anti-CASPR2 antibody, anti-AMPA1 receptor antibody, and anti-AMPA2 receptor antibody.
Posttranslational modifications of histone proteins regulate gene expression via complex protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions with chromatin.
