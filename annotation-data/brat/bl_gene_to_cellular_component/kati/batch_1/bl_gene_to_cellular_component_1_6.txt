Binding of activation-dependent integrin antibodies reveals a role for Src in maintaining integrin activity.
Moreover, EEAC up-regulated the growth-suppressing proteins, adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), p21 and p27, but down-regulated the growth-promoting proteins, protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian tarfet of rapamycin (mTOR), extracellular signal-regulating kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), retinoblastoma protein (Rb), cyclin E, and cyclin D1.
Among the up-regulated genes were chemokines (CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL16) and integrins (ITGA2, ITGA4, ITGA5, ITGA6, ITGA7).
Galanin functions are mediated by three distinct G-protein-coupled receptors, galanin receptor 1 (GalR1), GalR2 and GalR3, which activate different intracellular signaling pathways.
Among biological predictors, some studies indicate that activated EGFR, EGFR amplification, absence of KRAS mutations, PTEN expression, and low VEGFR expression are implicated in response to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies.
Consequently, this intracellular peptide inhibited EGF-induced EGFR/Grb2 associations but not EGFR/Shc or Shc/Grb2 associations.
Cell adhesion and the integrin-linked kinase regulate the LEF-1 and beta-catenin signaling pathways.
Candidate substrates include proteins involved in RNA metabolism (a putative RNA helicase, the nucleolar protein hNOP56, and hnRNP A1, and ribosomal proteins L4, L8, and L13), as well as keratin 17, a necdin-related protein, and the calcium-binding proteins desmoglein 2 and annexin II.
Cathepsin D decomposes cytoplasmic proteins, cell organelles, collagen, elastase and proteoglycans.
Inhibition of either protein kinase C (PKC) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) resulted in a reduction of extracellular PKM2 mediated claudin-1 expression, suggesting EGFR-PKC-claudin-1 as a signaling pathway in the extracellular PKM2-mediated tumorigenesis of colon cancer cells.
E. coli-derived and S. aureus-derived EVs significantly activated phosphorylation of extracellular signal related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p38 MAPK.
R-SMAD nuclear translocation increased Dlx5 and Pai1 transcription.
The telomerase-recruitment domain of the telomere binding protein Cdc13 is regulated by Mec1p/Tel1p-dependent phosphorylation.
Among them, four proteins with significant up-regulation, namely calcium-binding protein 1, protein disulfide isomerase, mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase precursor, and, glutathione-S-transferase mu1 and six proteins with significant down-regulation, namely catechol-O-methyltransferase, hemoglobin-alpha-2-chain, hemopexin precursor, methionine sulfoxide reductase A, catalase and carbonic anhydrase 3, were identified.
Alpha9 integrin promotes neurite outgrowth on tenascin-C and enhances sensory axon regeneration.
for 6?h), expression of pro-apoptotic genes (BNIP3, DUSP1), inflammatory markers (IL-1?, TNF-alpha, IL-6, MMP), and tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, -5), and S100b protein concentrations were analysed after a regeneration period of 24?h.
EGF-induced MAPK signaling inhibits hemidesmosome formation through phosphorylation of the integrin {beta}4.
Antibodies raised against GST alpha, GST mu, GST pi and microsomal GST were used to identify expression of these proteins in tissue sections.
Three regulatory networks were dramatically induced by CXCL13: Akt1/2-cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk1/2)-Cdk inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B), Integrin?3-focal adhesion kinase (Fak)/Src-Paxillin(PXN), and Akt-Jun-cAMP response-element binding protein (CREB1).
Nuclear spectrin-like proteins are structural actin-binding proteins in plants.
