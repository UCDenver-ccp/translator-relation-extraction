This is especially evident for pex3 and pex19 mutants, where the localization of receptor docking proteins (Pex13, Pex14) resulted in the identification of peroxisomal membrane remnants, which do not contain other peroxisomal membrane proteins, such as the ring proteins Pex2, Pex10 and Pex12.
Genes with altered expression in the heart due to hyperlipidemia included procollagen type III, cofilin/destrin, tensin, transcription repressor p66, synaptic vesicle protein 2B, Hsp86, chaperonin subunit 5epsilon, metallothionein, glutathione S-transferase, protein kinase C inhibitor, ATP synthase subunit c, creatine kinase, chloride intracellular channel 4, NADH oxidoreductase and dehydrogenase, fibronectin receptor beta chain, CD81 antigen, farnesyltransferase, calreticulin, disintegrin, p120 catenin, Smad7, etc.
Mechanism of regulation of the gap junction protein connexin 43 by protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation.
Initiation of CD99 type II signaling by antibody ligation increased expression of JunD and FosB AP-1 factors, along with phosphorylation of Src, Akt, p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK.
PD98059, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase kinase 1, suppressed TGF-beta1- or H2O2-induced IL-6 and AP-1 activation.
Further, the interrelated molecular pathways were chiefly related to endogenous nuclear estrogen receptor alpha network, forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) transcription factor network, activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) transcription factor network, regulation of telomerase, plasma membrane estrogen receptor signaling, estrogen biosynthesis, androgen receptor, FOXA transcription factor networks, estrogen biosynthesis, and phosphorylation of repair proteins.
During acrosome formation, several Golgi proteins (GBF1, GPP34, GRASP55) localize to both the acrosome and Golgi, while GL54D, TM9SF3, and the Golgi trafficking protein TMED7/p27 are segregated from the acrosome.
Importantly, Kindlin-2 interacted with EGFR kinase domain, which was independent of Kindlin-2 binding to integrin cytoplasmic domain.
A bioinformatic search was carried for plant homologues of human serine-threonine protein kinases involved in regulation of cell division and microtubule protein phosphorylation (SLK, PAK6, PAK7, MARK1, MAST2, TTBK1, TTBK2, AURKA, PLK1, PLK4 and PASK).
Characterization of Smad phosphorylation and Smad-receptor interaction.
Employing sequential affinity chromatography with insulin-Affi-gel followed by insulin receptor monoclonal antibody agarose, atypical insulin binding activity was separated from insulin receptor binding activity.
Experimental knockdown of Zeb2 leads to an increase in BMP-Smad-dependent axon growth.
Receptor-associated protein (RAP), a general antagonist for binding of ligands to LDL receptor family members, inhibited APC-induced phosphorylation of Dab1 and GSK3beta, whereas anti-EPCR or anti-PAR1 blocking antibodies did not.
Specific absorption of this activity by anti-PLA2-II antibody indicated that the released PLA2 was PLA2-II.
The sortilin-related VPS10 domain-containing receptor 3 (SORCS3) is a type-I receptor transmembrane protein and a member of the vacuolar protein sorting 10 receptor family.
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) signal via G-proteins to intracellular second messengers.
Estrogen receptors were characterized in cytosol protein.
Choroidal endothelial cell migration, proliferation, cytoskeletal stress fibers, Rac1 activation, and phosphorylated VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), integrin ?3, and Src were measured.
Liver phospho-Smad (P-Smad)1,5,8 and Id1 messenger RNA levels were measured as markers of Bmp/Smad signaling.
Microsomal glutathione transferase 1 (MGST1) is an integral homo-trimeric membrane protein with transferase and peroxidase activities.
