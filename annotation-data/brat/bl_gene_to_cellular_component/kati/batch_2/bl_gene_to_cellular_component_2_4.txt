Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and alpha(v)beta5 integrins were often highly, but heterogeneously, expressed.
Nearly 30 proteins have been identified as members of the TGF-beta superfamily in mammals, and can be classified based on whether they activate activin/TGF-beta-specific R-Smads (AR-Smads) or BMP-specific R-Smads (BR-Smads).
Sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses and molecular modeling indicate that p53 and Smad proteins simultaneously occupy overlapping p53 and Smad regulatory elements to establish repression of AFP transcription.
Mechanistically, PROX1, FOXC2, and flow coordinately control expression of the gap junction protein connexin37 and activation of calcineurin/NFAT signaling.
A subclass of Smad proteins, including Smad6 and Smad7, has been shown to function as intracellular antagonists of TGF-beta family signaling.
Nuclear transport receptor binding to TPX2 inhibited Aurora A binding activity but not the microtubule-binding activity of TPX2.
Mitochondrial catalase induces cells transformation through nucleolin-dependent Cox-2 mRNA stabilization.
This intracellular signaling pathway is independent of protein kinase C and does not involve Raf, MAP/ERK kinase kinase-1, MAP/ERK kinase-1, or MAP/ERK kinase-2 and does not result in the activation of the p42/p44 ERK MAP kinases or the c-jun N-terminal kinases.
Giant isoforms, encoded by Nesprin-1 (Syne1) and Nesprin-2 (Syne2), are multifunctional actin-binding and nuclear-envelope-associated proteins belonging to the spectrin superfamily.
TPR-containing proteins include the anaphase promoting complex (APC) subunits cdc16, cdc23 and cdc27, the NADPH oxidase subunit p67 phox, hsp90-binding immunophilins, transcription factors, the PKR protein kinase inhibitor, and peroxisomal and mitochondrial import proteins.
At the protein level, integrins such as ?5-integrin (ITGA5), ITGA7, ITGAV, and ITGB3 were significantly increased during pregnancy.
Expression of proteins related to EMT and TGF-?/SMAD signaling pathway, such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, p-Samd3 and p-Smad2, was detected by western blot.
Targeted molecules include cell-surface receptors, such as the EGF receptor, HER2, death receptor 5 and IGF-1 receptor.
? In the nucleus, EGFR can modulate the expression of the DNA repair proteins, Ku70 and Ku80.
When cells were stained for phosphorylated p27(Kip1), FGF-2 markedly enhanced the staining of phosphorylated p27(Kip1) in nuclei, whereas both cAMP and TGF-beta2 prevented the phosphorylation of p27(Kip1).
Significant gradients in i) total cholesterol (LDLR+ patients?>?APOB+ patients?=?LDLR-/APOB- patients) ii) LDL cholesterol (LDLR+ patients?>?APOB+ patients?=?LDLR-/APOB- patients in men and LDLR+patients?>?APOB+ patients >LDLR-/APOB- patients in women), iii) triglycerides (LDLR-/APOB- patients?>?LDLR+ patients?>?APOB+ patients), and iv) HDL cholesterol (APOB+ patients?>?LDLR-/APOB- patients?=?LDLR+ patients) were shown.
Here we demonstrate that TLCN cytoplasmic region binds ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) family proteins that link membrane proteins to actin cytoskeleton.
Liver homogenate, mitochondria, and nucleus were used to measure cyclins, CDKs, and cell cycle regulatory proteins PCNA, pRb, p53, E2F, p21, p27, HGF, liver ATP, and mitochondrial function.
The identified proteins included structural proteins (actin/actin like proteins), metabolic proteins (calreticulin/calnexin, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, aminotransferase class-III, electron transfer flavoprotein, proteasome, alpha-subunit and carbonic anhydrase) and stress response proteins (chaperone protein htpG, selenium-binding protein and glutathione transferases).
Differential intracellular signaling of the GalR1 and GalR2 galanin receptor subtypes.
