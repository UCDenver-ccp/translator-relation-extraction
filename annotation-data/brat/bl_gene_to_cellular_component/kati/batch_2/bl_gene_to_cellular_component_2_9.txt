Levels of other cellular proteins with reported impact on the function of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and cell migration, including Ca(2+)-binding proteins (S100A11, S100A6, and S100A4) and proteasome protein (PSMA3), were affected by HBx.
Development of a monoclonal antibody capable of differentiating platelet PLA1/PLA1, PLA1/PLA2 and PLA2/PLA2 genotypes.
ABH2 interacts with DNA repair proteins Ku70 and Ku80 as well as nucleolar proteins nucleolin, nucleophosmin 1, and upstream binding factor (UBF).
Since an inhibitor for p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) prevented the RANKL-mediated HO-1 suppression and extracellular release of HMGB1, these effects were p38 MAPK-dependent.
Akt/GSK-3 pathway, MAP kinases pathway, postsynaptic density proteins).
Although treatment of cells with TGF beta 1 up-regulated accumulation of p27(kip1) in both nucleus and cytoplasm, the association of the p27(kip1) with cdk2, cyclin A, cyclin D2, cyclin D3, and cdk4 was markedly down-regulated, suggesting that p27(kip1) is not responsible for the downregulation of the kinase activity.
GST-Ras2 fusion proteins undergo the post-translational modifications required for Ras2p to become membrane localized.
The novel membrane protein TMEM59 modulates complex glycosylation, cell surface expression, and secretion of the amyloid precursor protein.
The phosphorylation state of p44 and p42 MAPKs was examined using antibodies that distinguish phospho-p44/42 MAPK (P-MAPK, Thr(202)/Tyr(204)) from total p44/42 MAPK (T-MAPK, activated plus inactivated) in human ovarian and placental cells.
NHE1, NHE3, NHE1 with the cytoplasmic domain of NHE3 (N1N3), and NHE3 with the cytoplasmic domain of NHE1 (N3N1).
Fibronectin-alpha4beta1 integrin interactions modulate p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation in steatotic liver cold ischemia-reperfusion injury.
Cells expressing Jak2-V617F exhibit constitutive STAT, MAPK, and PI3K signalling, and constitutive association of the multi-site docking protein Gab1 to PIP3 at the plasma membrane.
DRG2 knockdown prolonged the EGF receptor (EGFR) localization in endosome, enhanced Akt activity and inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3?.
Interestingly, forced nuclear localization of Cst20 inhibited Cek1-Ace2 signaling, while forced cytoplasmic localization of Cst20 retained full signaling activity, suggesting that nuclear Cst20 downregulates the Cek1 pathway.
Pivotal function for cytoplasmic protein FROUNT in CCR2-mediated monocyte chemotaxis.
In contrast to collagen, both p38 MAP kinase and p42/p44 MAP kinase participated in the phosphorylation of cytosolic PLA2 in platelets stimulated by cross-linking of the low-affinity receptor for immune complexes, Fc gammaRIIA.
Although the activation of Smad signaling pathways downstream of TGF-beta superfamily ligands by receptor-mediated Smad phosphorylation is well understood, nothing is known about Smad phosphatases that turn off Smad activity.
p-Akt and p-MAPK were also significantly downregulated by the HER3 antibody after NRG1 stimulation.
Additionally, the protein level of SMAD7, an inhibitor of SMAD signaling, was elevated and the level of SMURF1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase for SMAD7 protein, was diminished in KEAP1 knockdown HK2.
Op18/stathmin (Op18), a conserved microtubule-depolymerizing and tubulin heterodimer-binding protein, is a major interphase regulator of tubulin monomer-polymer partitioning in diverse cell types in which Op18 is abundant.
