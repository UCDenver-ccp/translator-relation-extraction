Heterochromatin proteins HP1-alpha and HP1-beta localize in heterochromatic shells, whereas HP1-gamma is associated with euchromatin.
This binding, as well as IL-6 production, was blocked by anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody.
This protein, which is localized around the nucleus, is involved in determining the nuclear localization of REST4 and REST/NRSF.
ADAM10 is a membrane-anchored metalloprotease that sheds, besides APP, the ectodomain of a large variety of cell-surface proteins including cytokines, adhesion molecules and notch.
Local cholesterol increase triggers amyloid precursor protein-Bace1 clustering in lipid rafts and rapid endocytosis.
Mim1-deficient mitochondria accumulate Tom40 at the first SAM stage like Tom5-deficient mitochondria.
Targeted shRNA knockdown of caveolin-1 restored PDGF receptor and reversed E-cadherin membrane trafficking, despite Cdx2 expression.
LC MS/MS identified intracellular proteins, calmodulin, actin, and hemopexin and plasma proteins, such as apolipoproteins, lectin, plasminogen and transferrin.
In humans, two ALT isoforms have been characterized: ALT1, cytosolic, and ALT2, mitochondrial.
Moreover, AKT phosphorylation on Cx43 and integrin α5 enhanced their interaction.
Secreted frizzled-related proteins 1 (SFRP1) and low-density lipoprotein-related protein 5 (LRP5), a Wnt protein antagonist and a coreceptor, have been found to regulate skeletogenesis.
The cnx1+ encoded protein, Cnx1, was shown to be a calcium binding type I integral membrane glycoprotein.
Hsp90 was either immunoadsorbed to BF4 antibody-Sepharose or GST-Hsp90 fusion protein (GST.90) was adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose.
Antibodies directed against the activated, phosphorylated forms of proteins were used when appropriate (SMAD1/5/8, SMAD2/3).
Repression of major histocompatibility complex I-A beta gene expression by dbpA and dbpB (mYB-1) proteins.
Moreover, we showed that p53 family member ΔNp63α transcriptionally suppressed integrin β1 expression and is responsible for metformin-mediated upregulation of integrin β1.
Transfecting H460 cells with mKeap1-pEGFP and screenig for Keap1 expressing clones by Western blotting with antibodies against Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1 and AKR1C.
PCSK9 may affect the activity of other receptors beyond LDL receptors (LDLR), such as cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), very-low-density-lipoprotein (VLDL) receptors, apolipoprotein (Apo) E receptors, LDLR-related protein 1 (LRP-1) and ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter (ABCA1).
Their biological functions involved in carbohydrate metabolism, protein metabolism and modification, lipid metabolism, coenzyme and prosthetic group metabolism, cell cycle, immunity and defense, cell structure and motility, signal transduction, protein targeting and localization, neuronal activities, muscle contraction, etc. Peroxiredoxin1 (Prdx) was down-regulated, whereas alpha-enolase (ENO1) and vesicle amine transport protein 1 homolog (VAT1) up-regulated.
