Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2), a matricellular protein, is known to upregulate extracellular matrix production, including collagen in PDL tissue.
Under salt stress, the calcium sensor SOS3 activates the kinase SOS2 that positively regulates SOS1, a plasma membrane sodium/proton antiporter.
The lysosomal membrane glycoproteins lamp-1, lamp-2, and CD63, are abundantly present on the granule-delimiting outer membrane, which becomes incorporated into the CTL plasma membrane during lethal hit delivery.
Usp16 deubiquitinates Plk1, resulting in an enhanced interaction with kinetochore-localized proteins such as BubR1, and thereby retains Plk1 on the kinetochores to promote proper chromosome alignment in early mitosis.
Concomitantly, LCN2 restored the membrane distribution of the tight junction protein ZO-1 and the adherens junction protein VE-cadherin.
Signals by cytokines of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily are negatively regulated by inhibitory Smads (I-Smads).
Co-immunoprecipitation and GST-pull down assays identified the IF-1 mitochondrial matrix inhibitor of the F1F0-ATPase as a new Sgk-1 binding partner, which represents the first observed mitochondrial target of Sgk-1.
Whereas beta-ZOL mainly had an impact on the biological activity of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), protein kinase B (Akt), eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and its repressor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), DON reduced the abundance of p38 MAPk, Akt and specific 4E-BP1 bands.
The exact sites, structures, and molecular mechanisms of interaction between junction organizing zona occludence protein 1 (ZO-1) and the tight junction protein occludin or the adherens junction protein alpha-catenin are unknown.
These results were validated in Fbln5(RGE/RGE) mice, which harbor a point mutation in the integrin-binding RGD motif of Fbln5, preventing its interaction with integrins.
Concomitantly, the expression of TNFR1 protein is down-regulated in response to CD137L activation, due to enhanced extracellular release and internalization of TNFR1.
Upon genotoxic stress, cytoplasmic pools of MRLC-bound AATF are phosphorylated through the p38MAPK/MK2 checkpoint kinase complex.
Phosphorylated Smad1, Smad5, and Smad9 are the activated signaling molecules of the BMP pathway that transfer BMP signals from the cell surface to the nucleus.
These therapies target osteoclasts (receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand, integrin αvβ3, c-Src, cathepsin K), osteoblasts (dickkopf-1, activin A, endothelin A) and the bone marrow microenvironment (transforming growth factor β, bone morphogenetic proteins, chemokine CXCL-12 and its receptor CXCR4).
Photoaffinity labeling of insulin receptor proteins of liver plasma membrane preparations.
While regucalcin had no effect on basal Smad activation by TGFβ and BMP2, it enhanced the suppressive effect of TNFα on both TGFβ- and BMP2-induced Smad activations.
The multidrug resistance (mdr) is associated with a membrane-bound channel-forming transport protein, the P-glycoprotein.
ALK5 activity, not bone morphogenetic protein type I receptors, is required for Smad phosphorylation.
Here, we identify the essential autophagy protein Atg12 as a positive mediator of mitochondrial apoptosis and show that Atg12 directly regulates the apoptotic pathway by binding and inactivating prosurvival Bcl-2 family members, including Bcl-2 and Mcl-1.
IL-1beta also stimulated phosphorylation of several protein tyrosine kinases such as c-Src and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), which was further confirmed by western blotting using an anti-phospho-c-Src or anti-phospho-PDGFR antibody, respectively.
