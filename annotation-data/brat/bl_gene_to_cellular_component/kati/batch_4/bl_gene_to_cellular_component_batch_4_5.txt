PPP3CA encodes calmodulin-binding catalytic subunit of calcineurin, a ubiquitously expressed calcium/calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase.
Mass spectrometric analyses of TIVE-LTC proteins immunoprecipitated by anti-LANA-1 and ANG antibodies identified 28 common cellular proteins such as ribosomal proteins, structural proteins, tRNA synthetases, metabolic pathway enzymes, chaperons, transcription factors, antioxidants, and ubiquitin proteosome proteins.
The chalcones increased the GLUT4 level in the plasma membrane of L6 cells, but activated neither protein kinase C ζ/λ, Akt, nor adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, all of which regulate the GLUT4 translocation.
Bcl-2 can therefore target Raf-1 to mitochondrial membranes, allowing this kinase to phosphorylate BAD or possibly other protein substrates involved in apoptosis regulation.
These results suggested that leptin regulated the subcellular localization of FOXO1 and induced Akt phosphorylation.
Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9), the last member of the family of Proprotein Convertases related to Subtilisin and Kexin, regulates LDL-cholesterol by promoting the endosomal/lysosomal degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLR).
Exogenous VEGF-B promoted diabetic corneal nerve fiber regeneration through the reactivation of PI-3K/Akt-GSK3β-mTOR signaling and the attenuation of neuronal mitochondria dysfunction via the VEGF receptor-1 and neuropilin-1.
Reintroducing claudin-7 reduces cell proliferation, upregulates integrin β1 expression and increases cell-matrix adhesion.
Analysis of the signaling pathways downstream of PAR4 activation in HT29 cells showed (i) a sustained phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and (ii) the involvement of epidermal growth factor receptor B-2 (ErbB-2) but not of epidermal growth factor receptor in PAR4-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation.
There are three major subfamilies of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK): the extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERK MAPK); the c-jun N-terminal kinase or stress-activated protein kinases (JNK or SAPK); and MAPK14.
Regulation of cell adhesion to collagen via beta1 integrins is dependent on interactions of filamin A with vimentin and protein kinase C epsilon.
The synaptic localization of EAAC1 differed considerably from that of GluR2, in that GluR2 immunolabelling was most commonly located within the postsynaptic density, but EAAC1 localization was more heterogeneous and was predominant at the edge of postsynaptic densities and perisynaptic zones.
Therefore, Rac1 and Cdc42 seem to synergistically induce lamellipodia and membrane ruffles in EGF-stimulated Cos1 cells and A431 cells.
In this chapter, we will briefly introduce inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies that target the main growth factor-modulated scenarios including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling pathways in breast cancer therapy.
Here, we demonstrated that O. tsutsugamushi colocalizes with integrin alpha 5 beta 1 and activates integrin signaling effectors, including focal adhesion kinase, Src kinase, and RhoA GTPase, and also recruits signaling adaptors, such as talin and paxillin, to the site of infection.
Thalidomide also suppressed IL-1beta-induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, while a p38 MAPK inhibitor destabilized COX-2 mRNA and the cytoplasmic shuttling of HuR induced by IL-1beta.
Cells seeded on nano-fibrous scaffolds sustained expression of alpha2 integrin in the presence of dehydroproline, while suppression of alpha2 integrin was evident in cells seeded on solid-walled scaffolds.
There were EGFR and FGFR-2 antibody positive cells in normal skin from fetal and adult, but the expressive levels of EGFR and FGFR-2 protein had apparent difference, with the time of fetation increasing, the EGFR and FGFR-2 positive expression rate became stronger gradually.
Pot1 intracellular localization was examined with protein fractionation.
Interestingly, we found that HGF treatment of NPC cell lines induced early growth response protein (EGR-1) expression, which is involved in cell migration and invasion.
