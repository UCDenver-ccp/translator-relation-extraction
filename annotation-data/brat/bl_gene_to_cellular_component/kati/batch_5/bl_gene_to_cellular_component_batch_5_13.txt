In wild-type fibrosarcoma cells (2fTGH), IFN activates STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3, as well as NF-kappaB complexes comprised of p50 and p65.
Furthermore, exposure to insulin resulted in the cytoplasmic localization of menin and increased interaction with FOXO1.
S1P acting through S1P2 and S1P3 receptors activated intracellular calcium mobilization and extracellular signal-regulated and Rho-associated kinases to regulate gene expression.
Mechanistically, impaired BMP2- or Dex-osteoinduction in BMSCs of elderly mice was mediated by inhibited phosphorylation of intracellular R-Smads and Erk1/2 or Erk1/2 and p38 proteins, and decreased Runx2 and Osx expression (osteogenesis "master" regulators) were also detected.
Planar cell polarity protein Celsr1 regulates endothelial adherens junctions and directed cell rearrangements during valve morphogenesis.
TIIA did not affect the LPS-induced HIF-1α mRNA level but inhibited HIF-1α protein translation by the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways and related protein translational regulators, such as p70S6K1, S6 ribosomal protein, 4E-BP1, and eIF4E, and promoted HIF-1α protein degradation via the proteasomal pathway in LPS-stimulated macrophages.
The phosphorylation level of beta(3) integrin was modulated using a temperature-sensitive v-Src kinase.
The gamma-secretase complex, composed by presenilin, nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2, is involved in intramembranous proteolysis of membrane proteins, such as amyloid precursor protein or Notch.
Phosphorylated lamin-A,C localizes to nucleoplasm, and phosphorylation is enriched on lamin-A,C fragments and is suppressed by a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor.
Recombinant Vps35 and a central fragment of Nbea bound to the large intracellular loop of GlyRβ in glutathione-S-transferase pull-downs; in addition, Vps35 displayed binding to gephyrin.
Further research suggested that FOXQ1 positively regulated cell proliferation in colorectal cancer and down-regulation of CDK6, extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).
Between-group differences in MAPKs (i.e., extracellular regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK) and AP-1 expressions were compared.
The enzyme specifically hydrolyzes not only extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin, vitronectin, and type IV collagen, but also integrins alpha1beta1 and alpha5beta1.
These biomarkers include calreticulin, fibrinogen-γ, superoxide dismutase, vimentin, malate dehydrogenase, and lamin B2.
Loss of c-myc repression coincides with ovarian cancer resistance to transforming growth factor beta growth arrest independent of transforming growth factor beta/Smad signaling.
Vitronectin variants served as substrate providing uPAR-mediated cell adhesion and optionally integrin binding.
Akt was phosphorylated by GLP-1 stimulation, which inhibited the expression of ATGL and increased the translocation of GLUT4 from the intracellular membranes to plasma membranes.
HIV-1 averts lethal restriction through its accessory protein Vif, which targets these APOBEC3 proteins for proteasomal degradation.
While in heterochromatin, Spt6 prevents histone turnover and cryptic transcription in parallel with Clr3 histone deacetylase.
The 45 kDa fragment lacks the heparin-binding domain and the integrin-binding domain, RGD, present in the non-processed Vitronectin glycoprotein.
