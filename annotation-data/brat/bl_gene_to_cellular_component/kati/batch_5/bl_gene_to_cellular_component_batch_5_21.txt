In summary, this study demonstrates interactions between BMP-2 and FGF21 pathways exist in vitro, and that FGF21 enhances the osteogenic activity of BMP-2 by up-regulating the BMP-2-dependent Smad signaling pathway.
The TGF-beta1 signal is carried by Smad proteins into the cell nucleus, resulting in the regulation of the expression of key myogenic regulatory factors including MyoD and myogenin during myogenesis.
We demonstrate that Acsl4a modulates the activity of Smad transcription factors, the downstream mediators of Bmp signaling.
We show that MKRN1 directly binds to the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC1) and associates with polysomes.
Finally, we have found that the down-regulation of HAS isozyme expression (by transfecting cells with HAS1/HAS2/HAS3-specific small interfering RNAs) not only inhibits HRG-mediated HAS phosphorylation/activation and HA production but also impairs CD44-specific Cdc42-PAK1/filamin signaling, cytoskeleton activation and tumor cell behaviors.
This condensed chromatin structure is associated with binding of DNMT3B and decreased occupancy of OCT1 transcription factor at MAML2 enhancer, suggesting a role of DNMT3B in increasing methylation of MAML2 after stilbenoid treatment.
Furthermore, sphingomyelinase treatment did not affect the membrane disposition of the HIV receptor proteins CD4, CXCR4, and CCR5, as determined by Triton X-100 extraction.
Additionally, the inhibition of LRP6 activity using DKK1 significantly abolished Wnt3a-induced glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β)(S9), extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2(T202/Y204), ribosomal protein S6 kinase(T359/S363), and Akt(S473) phosphorylation; and increased insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1)(S332) phosphorylation.
The markers used were protein (transferrin, haptoglobin, haemoglobin) and enzyme (lactate dehydrogenase, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, adenylate kinase).
VEGF stimulated phosphorylation of Mnk1 and eIF4E and induced Mnk1 to shift from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon phosphorylation.
G3BP binds strongly to glomerular basement membrane proteins and integrins.
Meanwhile, a mechanism study also showed that the upregulation of hsa-miR338-3p reduced Smad2/3 phosphorylation by suppressing TRAP-1 and thus inhibited the TGF-β/Smad pathway and TIMP1, a downstream protein.
SUN1 was detected throughout the nucleus; however, KASH5 was dispersed through the cell.
The plant G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are diverse membranous proteins that are responsible for signal transduction.
ADAM12 induces actin cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix reorganization during early adipocyte differentiation by regulating beta1 integrin function.
Our findings suggest that this apoptotic cellular modulation is brought about by up-regulation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bax and Bim and down-regulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 in mitochondrial fractions.
We tested whether vasopressin induces translocation of AQP2 from intracellular vesicles into the apical plasma membrane.
Centromeres mediate chromosome segregation and are defined by the centromere-specific histone H3 variant (CenH3)/centromere protein A (CENP-A).
On the other hand, nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 was observed in some cells of GST-P-positive lesions that were negative for Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and in GST-P-negative lesions of the DEN-FF group that were positive for Nrf2 in the cytoplasm.
During rhodopsin progression, ASAP1 serves as an activation platform that brings together the proteins necessary for transport to the cilia, including the Rab11a-Rabin8-Rab8 complex involved in ciliogenesis.
