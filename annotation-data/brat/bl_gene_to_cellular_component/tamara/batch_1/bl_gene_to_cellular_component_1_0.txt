VE-cadherin binding to Fc/VE-cadherin extracellular domain chimera activates Sdc1-coupled IGF1R and ?v?3 integrin; this depends on VEGFR2 and c-Src activated by the cadherin.
488-labeled anti-EGFR antibody (488-EGFR) and allophycocyanin (APC)-labeled anti-EpCAM antibody (APC-EpCAM), respectively.
It is composed of the integral membrane proteins Tim17 and Tim23 and the peripheral membrane protein Tim44, which recruits mitochondrial Hsp70 to the sites of protein import.
Downregulation of APP leads to reduced cell surface levels of TrkA/p75NTR and increased endocytosis of TrkA/p75NTR and NGF.
We determined that (a) the cell surface integrin that increased in response to TGF-beta 1 treatment of NR4 cells was alpha 1 integrin; (b) TGF-beta 1 altered the ability of NR4 cells to attach to collagen and laminin, the extracellular matrix components that interact with the alpha 1 beta 1 integrin receptor; (c) TGF-beta 1 treatment resulted in relocalization of the alpha 1 integrin on the NR4 cell surface; and (d) TGF-beta 1-mediated inhibition of anchorage-independent growth was blocked by the presence of alpha 1 integrin antibody.
Integrin-induced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation also depended on both EGFR and c-Src kinase activities.
CR upregulated tight junction proteins including claudin-1, claudin-5 and ZO-1, downregulated VEGF and VEGFR2, enhanced ?-SMA expression, and reduced AQP1 expression in U87 gliomas.
The smad7 gene is a TGF-beta target induced by Smad signaling, and its promoter contains the Smad-binding element (SBE) required for a positive regulation by the TGF-beta/Smad pathway.
TGF-beta1 bioactivity and Smad2 phosphorylation were alphavbeta(3)-integrin-dependent, since beta(3)-integrin antibody and alphavbeta(3)-integrin inhibitor (SB-223245, 10 microM) significantly prevented TGF-beta1 bioactivity and Smad2 phosphorylation.
TLR7 in Mtb infected macrophages was up-regulated and up-regulation of TLR7 could eliminate intracellular Mtb.
Expression of surface TLR-4, CD14, CD4, CD3, as well as of intracellular phosphorylated (p42/p44) ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were assessed by flow cytometry.
Leptin receptor signal transduction involves phosphorylation of cytosolic signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins, specifically phosphorylation of STAT3 (P-STAT3).
The intracellular chloride channel proteins CLIC1 and CLIC4 induce IL-1? transcription and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome.
Furthermore, Smad could repress Tax transcriptional activation, indicating reciprocal repression between Tax and Smad.
Tyr pocket mutations selectively impair PLK1 binding to the kinetochore phosphoprotein substrate PBIP1, but not to the centrosomal substrate NEDD1.
The integrin-binding protein Nischarin regulates cell migration by inhibiting PAK.
The cytoplasmic localization of Hug1p-GFP is dependent on MEC1 pathway genes and coincides with the cytoplasmic localization of Rnr2p-Rnr4p.
The levels of NF-?B, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), TNF receptor-2 (TNFR-2), intracellular IL-8 and its surface receptor CXCR2, were determined.
SENP3 increased the level of Sp1 protein via antagonizing the SUMO2/3-targeted ubiquitination and the consequent proteasome-dependent degradation that was mediated by RNF4.
Thus, TORC2-SLM signaling negatively regulates calcineurin, and calcineurin negatively regulates TORC2-SLM.
