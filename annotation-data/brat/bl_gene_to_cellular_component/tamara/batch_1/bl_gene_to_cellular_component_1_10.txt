Confocal immunofluorescence showed a vast co-localization of ATP6V0C protein and LASS2/TMSG1 protein in plasma and membrane.
The expression of inhibitory Smads (Smad6 and 7) largely overlaps with receptor regulated Smads, indicating that negative feedback on BMP/TGF-beta signaling is critical throughout all stages of tooth morphogenesis.
Tie1 phosphorylation was, however, Tie2 dependent because 1) Ang1 failed to induce Tie1 phosphorylation when Tie2 was down-regulated in endothelial cells; 2) Tie1 phosphorylation was induced in the absence of Ang1 by either a constitutively active form of Tie2 or a Tie2 agonistic antibody; 3) in HEK 293 cells Ang1 phosphorylated a form of Tie1 without kinase activity when coexpressed with Tie2, and Ang1 failed to phosphorylate Tie1 when coexpressed with kinase-defective Tie2.
The actin cytoskeleton-associated protein talin binds to integrins, vinculin, and actin.
Here we identified Pin1, a peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase, as a novel protein binding Smads.
The mitochondrial enriched GCN5-like 1 (GCN5L1) protein has been shown to modulate mitochondrial protein acetylation, mitochondrial content and mitochondrial retrograde signaling.
Central role of paxillin phosphorylation in regulation of LFA-1 integrins activity and lymphocyte migration.
Insulin privation did not alter early insulin signaling steps (IR?, IRS-1 and Shc) or downstream elements (Akt, P70S6K, S6 ribosomal protein, AMPK, MAPK ERK2 and MAPK P38).
Smads are intracellular mediators of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily signaling.
Specific intracellular inhibitors of p42/44 MAPK, Pi3 kinase and protein kinase C?II were used.
Modulation of integrin signal transduction by ILKAP, a protein phosphatase 2C associating with the integrin-linked kinase, ILK1.
The TGF-beta signal transduction pathways in HMC were studied by measuring the receptor-regulated Smad proteins (Smad 2 and 3) and common-partner Smad proteins (Smad 4).
Other integrins, such as the alpha2beta1 collagen receptor on platelets, are also regulated by protein disulfide isomerase and thiol metabolism.
The cell-polarity protein Par6 links Par3 and atypical protein kinase C to Cdc42.
Treatment with transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) caused rapid translocation of BMPR-IB to the cell surface, mediated via the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase C (PKC) pathways.
In cancer cells, Twist1 is upregulated by multiple factors including SRC-1, STAT3, MSX2, HIF-1?, integrin-linked kinase and NF-?B.
Furthermore, APE1/ref-1 overexpression inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced increase in intracellular superoxide and p38 MAPK phosphorylation.
Removal of lactoferrin from plasma is mediated by binding to low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor and transport to endosomes.
Cdt1 and DDB1 interact in extracts, and DDB1 chromatin loading is dependent on the binding of Cdt1 to PCNA, which indicates that PCNA docking activates the pre-formed Cdt1-Cul4(DDB1) ligase complex.
Immunohistochemistry was performed using tissue microarray with antibodies directed against androgen receptor, phosphorylated androgen receptor, estrogen receptor ?, estrogen receptor ?, 5?-reductase 1 and 2, aromatase, BCAR1 and the proliferation marker Ki67.
