The CRE1-protein and CRE2-protein complexes were disrupted by CRE binding protein 1 (CREB1) antibodies and supershifted by phospho-CREB1 antibody.
Inhibitory Smads (I-Smads) have conserved carboxy-terminal MH2 domains but highly divergent amino-terminal regions when compared with receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) and common-partner Smads (co-Smads).
SALL4 also up-regulated integrin gene expression.
Mechanistically, PARP1 interacts with STAT3 and retains active phosphorylated-STAT3 in nucleus.
receptor antibody, anti-LGI1 antibody, anti-CASPR2 antibody, anti-AMPA1 receptor antibody, and anti-AMPA2 receptor antibody.
Deficiency of Macf1 in osterix expressing cells decreases bone formation by Bmp2/Smad/Runx2 pathway.
By a mechanism dependent on the activities of the Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling factor, the HMG-like factor Spt2, and the Spt6 and Spt16 histone chaperones, SRG1 transcription deposits nucleosomes over the SER3 promoter to prevent transcription factors from binding and activating SER3.
These proteins, including ezrin, radixin, and moesin, probably function as molecular linking proteins, connecting the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane.
Evidence for proteasomal degradation of Kv1.5 channel protein.
Parallel use of monospecific antibodies against CDR protein and tubulin emphasizes the spatial restriction in the localization of CDR protein during mitosis and early G1 phase of the cell cycle.
Spy1 protein mediates phosphorylation and degradation of SCG10 protein in axonal degeneration.
The anti-apoptotic protein family (bcl-2) and integrins, in particular beta 1 integrin, balance the pro apoptotic signals.
We also showed by transfection of a fusion protein of green fluorescent protein and Brunol1 protein into NIH3T3 cells, that Brunol1 is localized in cytoplasm and nucleus.
Additionally, the co-localisation of the transmembrane tight junction proteins occludin, JAM-A and claudin-1, with the intracellular adhesion protein ZO-1 was modified.
The two galectins also utilize different intracellular death pathways, as galectin-9, but not galectin-1, T cell death was blocked by intracellular Bcl-2, whereas galectin-1, but not galectin-9, T cell death was blocked by intracellular galectin-3.
Shc proteins are implicated in coupling receptor tyrosine kinase to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway by recruiting Grb2/SOS to the plasma membrane.
First, DZIP1 interacts with GLI3, a transcriptional regulator for Hedgehog signaling, and prevents GLI3 from entering the nucleus.
Exploring the mechanism, we found that SDF-1 treatment induced IQGAP1 binding to ?-tubulin and localization to CXCR4-containing endosomes and that CXCR4-containing EEA-1(+) endosomes were abnormally located distal from the microtubule (MT)-organizing center (MTOC) in IQGAP1-deficient cells.
TM cells responded to exogenous BMP-4 by phosphorylating Smad signaling proteins.
Extracellular treatment of HEK293-CD8/MUC1 cells with CD8 antibody induced intracellular Tyr phosphorylation of the MUC1 CT and activated ERK1/2, but not the p38, SAPK/JNK, or ERK5 MAP kinases.
