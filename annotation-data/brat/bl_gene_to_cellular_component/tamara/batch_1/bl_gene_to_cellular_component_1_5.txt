Ipl1 and Sli15 also bind to Dam1, a microtubule-binding protein required for mitotic spindle integrity and kinetochore function.
These prominent proteins in the inclusion bodies, including tau, alpha-synuclein, and huntingtin protein, are modified by transglutaminase in vitro and alpha-synuclein and huntingtin protein are modified in cells in culture.
The coupling of metabolic energy to outer membrane cobalamin transport requires the TonB protein and is stimulated by the ExbB protein.
The transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein UNC93B plays an essential role in the normal response to signalling through intracellular Toll-like receptor (TLR)3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9.
Complex formation between galectin-8 and integrins involves sugar-protein interactions and triggers integrin-mediated signaling cascades such as Tyr phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin.
Pretreatment with VEGF receptor 2-neutralizing antibody abolished VEGF-stimulated downregulation of EphB4 but not the upregulation of dll4.
The association of Grb2 with beta-adrenergic receptors was established using antibodies to Grb2 as well as a Grb2-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein.
Many cells expressed synaptophysin, neurofilament protein, and GFAP.
IL-25 could synergistically induce the release of Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10, inflammatory cytokine IL-6, Th1 related chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, and chemokine CCL5 from anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies costimulated Th cells, especially memory Th cells.
However, Myo1a or Myo6 dependent defects in expression of membrane proteins that traffic between the BB membrane and endosome (NaPi2b, NHE3, CFTR) are not restored.
PLAC8-induced EMT was linked to increased phosphorylated ERK2 (p-ERK2), and ERK2 knockdown restored cell surface CDH1 and suppressed CDH3, VIM, and ZEB1 upregulation.
Analysis of mitochondrial co-localization of Bcl-2 family proteins demonstrated sAC- and protein kinase A-dependent translocation of Bax to mitochondria.
Delivery of peroxisome-targeted matrix proteins depends on the PEX5 receptor docking with PEX13 at the peroxisomal membrane, and we found severely reduced import of matrix proteins and less organelle-associated PEX5 in pex13-4 seedlings.
Since Ajuba is known to activate MAP kinase enzymes, and its homologue Zyxin binds to cytoskeletal proteins, we propose that Ajuba is a scaffolding protein allowing GLT-1 to regulate intracellular signaling or interact with the cytoskeleton.
The p41 and MAPK proteins are localized in the cytosol.
Among these proteins were glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), heat shock protein 8, dihydropyrimidinase related proteins 2 and 3, protein-L-isoaspartate O-methyltransferase, beta-spectrin, and clathrin protein MKIAA0034, linking either directly or indirectly to MAP1B.
Epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like modules are involved in protein-protein interactions and are found in numerous extracellular proteins and membrane proteins.
The most obvious connection between PPT1, TPP1, CLN3, CLN5, CLN6, and CLN8 is their subcellular localization.
On the other hand, FSOY elevated adipose expression levels of genes involved in TG-rich lipoprotein uptake (ApoE, VLDLR, and Lrp1), fatty acid oxidation (PPAR?, CPT1?, LCAD, CYP4A1, UCP2, and UCP3), HDL-biogenesis (ABCA1, ApoA1, and LXR?), and adiponectin signaling (AdipoQ, AdipoR1, and AdipoR2), as well as levels of phosphorylated AMPK and ACC.
Steroid signaling in plants comprises the plasma membrane receptor kinases BRI1 and BAK1 and intracellular protein phosphorylations.
