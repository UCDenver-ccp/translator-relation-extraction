RSK2 protein suppresses integrin activation and fibronectin matrix assembly and promotes cell migration.
The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) inhibitor Emi1 controls progression to S phase and mitosis by stabilizing key APC/C ubiquitination substrates, including cyclin A. Examining Emi1 binding proteins, we identified the Evi5 oncogene as a regulator of Emi1 accumulation.
General transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) consists of nine subunits: cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (Cdk7), cyclin H and MAT1 (forming the Cdk-activating-kinase or CAK complex), the two helicases Xpb/Hay and Xpd, and p34, p44, p52 and p62 (refs 1-3).
Other approaches considered were competitive antagonists of the S1P1 receptor, inhibitors of the S1P lyase to prevent S1P degradation, and anti-S1P antibodies.
TGF-beta signals through TGF-beta receptors and Smad proteins.
Smad and p38 MAPK signaling have been found to independently and additively regulate alpha1(I) collagen gene expression by transcriptional activation while p38 MAPK, but not Smad signaling, increases alpha1(I) collagen mRNA stability, leading to increased synthesis and deposition of type I collagen.
Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) is an adaptor protein that has been shown to couple cell surface receptors, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor, to intracellular signaling events.
The homologue genes included transcription factors, extracellular matrix proteins, immunosuppressant-binding proteins, enzymes, cell adhesion molecules, morphogenetic proteins, growth factors, member of the ubiquitin proteosome pathway, RNA-binding proteins, and signal-transduction proteins.
The cholesterol transporter ABCG1 modulates the subcellular distribution and proteolytic processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein.
Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) stabilizes cytoskeletal polymerization, while CRMP2 phosphorylation by Cdk5 and GSK3? loses its affinity for cytoskeleton proteins, leading to the inhibition of axonal growth.
We also show that gastrin activates the integrin pathway via the phosphorylation of ?1 integrin by a Src family kinase.
The obtained antibody did not crossreact with SSTR1, SSTR3, SSTR4, SSTR5, hypothalamic hormones, pituitary hormones, neuropeptides or gut hormones.
Quercetin increased p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), but inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase in RASMCs.
With the disintegrin (DIS) domain ADAM8 binds integrins such as ?1 integrin, thereby activating integrin signaling pathways.
LELI promoted HIG-82 synovial fibroblast proliferation and induced cytoplasmic localization of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p15 (INK4B/CDKN2B).
Down-regulation of alphav integrin decreased phosphorylated NF-kappaB p65 and increased phosphorylated JNK2 in multicellular spheroids.
Nix and Nip3 form a subfamily of pro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins.
Whereas TLR2 and TLR4 recognize viral components at the cell surface, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 are exclusively expressed in endosomal compartments.
The integrin-associated adaptor proteins integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and kindlin-2 play central roles in integrin signaling and control of cell morphology.
Nestin downregulation also leads to an increase in the protein levels of integrin ?5?1 at the cell membrane, activation of integrin ?1 and an increase in integrin clustering.
