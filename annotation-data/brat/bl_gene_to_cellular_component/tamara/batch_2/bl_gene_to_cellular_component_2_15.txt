These include cell-cell interaction (TAPA-1, contactin, tachykinin receptor, phospholipase A2), cellular remodeling (C1q beta isoform, heat shock protein), neurofilament assembly (alpha tubulin and alpha internexin), neurotransmitter release (VAMP-2, amphiphysin, carboxypeptidase E, scg 10 and proton channel), energy metabolism (mitochondrial hinge protein, ADP/ATP transporter, cytochrome oxidase subunits), RNA processing (helix destabilizing protein, ribonucleoprotein) and protein synthesis (eIF-4A initiation factor, ribosomal protein S27).
As PP2A substrates, the phosphorylation of MAPK pathway members, p38, ERK1/2, and the cytoskeleton-associated proteins, Hsp27, VASP, Tau, and Ezrin were increased.
Calmodulin-binding protein of erythrocyte cytoskeleton.
Furthermore, PTK7 regulated Id1 expression through modulating TGF-?/Smad signaling, while pharmacological inhibition on TGF-?/Smad signaling or PTK7/Id1 depletion attenuated TGF-?-stimulated cell proliferation.
Here we examine the other major binding interactions of sickle membrane proteins including spectrin self-association, binding of ankyrin and protein 4.1 to protein 3, and the formation of the spectrin-actin-protein 4.1 complex.
The docking protein SNT1/FRS2 (fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2) is implicated in the transmission of extracellular signals from the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), which plays vital roles during embryogenesis.
Immunoblotting was performed to evaluate phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear p50, and cytoplasmic p50.
Smad ubiquitylation regulatory factor-1 (SMURF1) promotes RUNX2 degradation and negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation, whereas RUNX2 activates SMURF1 transcription in osteoblasts.
However in the pericardium, ETOH animals had increased expression of proadhesion proteins focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, phosphorylated paxillin, vinculin, integrin-?1, tumor necrosis factor-?, transforming growth factor-?, and phosphorylated SMAD3, and decreased expression of adhesion breakdown proteins MMP1, MMP3, MMP9, and plasmin compared with SUC animals.
Although subtle, the reduction in constitutive TGFBR1 expression alters SMAD-mediated TGF-beta signaling.
In comparison with PRCC1, PRCC2 cases showed upregulated expression of ?5-integrin (ITGA5) whereas the expression of ?6- (ITGA6) and ?8-integrins (ITGB8) was downregulated.
These proteins were categorized as 1) transport proteins (one increased and two decreased in NHERF2 null); 2) signaling molecules (2 increased in NHERF2 null); 3) cytoskeleton/junctional proteins (4 upregulated and 1 downregulated in NHERF2 null); and 4) metabolic proteins/intrinsic BB proteins) (2 upregulated and 1 downregulated in NHERF2 null).
OPN regulates FoxM1 to influence HEC-1A cell proliferation through extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK 1/2), protein kinase B (PKB, AKT), and the p38 mitogen activated protein kinases (p38MAPK, p38) signaling pathway.
The localization of Eps8 at the cell cortex is largely independent from the binding of Eps8 to an EGFR/ErbB-2 chimeric receptor.
In addition to blocking MKK5 (MAPK kinase?5) activation in the MEKK1 (MAPK kinase kinase 1)/MEKKs-MKK4/5-MPK3/6 cascade, HopF2 targets additional component(s) upstream of MEKK1 in the MEKK1-MKK1/2-MPK4 cascade and the plasma membrane-localized receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase BIK1 and its homologs.
Tipin/Tim1/And1 protein complex promotes Pol alpha chromatin binding and sister chromatid cohesion.
These axonal growth inhibitory proteins are mediated via activation of Rho, a small GTP-binding protein.
Membrane-recruitment of GRK2 (G-protein receptor kinase 2) provides a fundamental step in the desensitization process controlling GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors), such as the beta2AR (beta2-adrenergic receptor).
Three classes of Smads have been defined: the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), the common-mediator Smads (co-Smads), and the antagonistic or inhibitory Smads (I-Smads).
Co-localization of the endogenous and the transfected exogenous p53 protein by polyclonal antibodies to anti-p53 protein revealed strong exogenous p53 staining in the transfected nuclei and weak staining of endogenous p53 protein in the cytoplasm.
