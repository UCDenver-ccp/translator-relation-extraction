Neither transfection of a Kindlin-2 mutant incapable of binding to ?1 integrin nor knockdown of ?1 integrin influenced the effect of Kindlin-2 on TGF-?1-induced Smad3 activation, indicating that this effect is independent of integrin.
Focal adhesion protein paxillin links integrin and growth factor signaling to actin cytoskeleton.
Here, an epistatic mini-array profile reveals critical requirements for Brc1 in mutants that are defective in multiple DNA damage response pathways, including checkpoint signaling by Rad3-Rad26/ATR-ATRIP kinase, DNA repair by Smc5-Smc6 holocomplex, replication fork stabilization by Mrc1/claspin and Swi1-Swi3/Timeless-Tipin, and control of ubiquitin-regulated proteolysis by the COP9 signalosome (CSN).
Stimulation with ufCB also induced processing of membrane-anchored proheparin-binding (HB)-EGF, release of soluble HB-EGF into the medium, association of phosphorylated EGF-R and Shc with glutathione-S-transferase-Grb2 fusion protein, and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK).
SNX1 is a membrane-associated protein that functions in lysosomal sorting of the epidermal growth factor receptor.
Apc mutation increases cytoplasmic beta-catenin, a regulatory protein associated with the cytoskeleton.
The alpha 2 beta 1 integrin serves as a cell surface collagen or collagen/laminin receptor.
Of these Smads, Smad4 is essential for TGF-beta signaling.
Moreover, we identified the calcineurin regulator Rcn2, the 4E-BP (translation initiation factor eIF4E-binding protein) translation repressor protein Caf20, and the Golgi-associated adaptor Gga1 as novel targets for Slt2.
ECs lacking VE-cadherin are less responsive to TGF-beta/ALK1- and TGF-beta/ALK5-induced Smad phosphorylation and target gene transcription.
Conversely, inhibition of TNFR1 activity by a TNFR1-neutralizing antibody inhibits CD137L-mediated cell adhesion, cell death, CD14 expression, and IL-8 production.
Smad6 and Smad7 prevent ligand-induced activation of signal-transducing Smad proteins in the transforming growth factor-beta family.
Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) regulates several cell functions by binding to its membrane receptor (ErbB1 and ErbB4).
This receptor interacts with the related protein Tie1 on the cell surface, and Tie1 inhibits Ang1 signalling through Tie2.
-integrin and P-selectin antibodies.
TGF-beta affects integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration by regulating the expression of integrins, their ligands and integrin-associated proteins.
Ribosomal protein S7 as a novel modulator of p53-MDM2 interaction: binding to MDM2, stabilization of p53 protein, and activation of p53 function.
alpha5beta1 integrin-mediated adhesion to Fn results in a phenotype that includes a reduction in cell proliferation, increased E-cadherin localization in cell-cell contacts, increased beta-catenin localization throughout the cell, inhibition of haptokinetic cell migration, and increased expression of PTHrP, IL-6 and IL-8 relative to alpha2beta1 integrin-mediated adhesion on Type I collagen.
Magnolol downregulated expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl2, upregulated expression of pro-apoptotic protein p53 and Bax, and caused the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c.
Selective integrin subunit reduction disrupts fibronectin extracellular matrix deposition and fibrillin 1 gene expression.
