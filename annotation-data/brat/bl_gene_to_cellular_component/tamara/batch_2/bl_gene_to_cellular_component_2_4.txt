Type II phospholipase A2 (PLA2-II) also induces translocation of Mac-1 from secretory vesicles.
Axin-independent phosphorylation of APC controls beta-catenin signaling via cytoplasmic retention of beta-catenin.
Galectin-1 transiently increased availability of beta1 integrins on the cell surface to antibodies against beta1 integrin.
The small GTPase Rac3 interacts with the integrin-binding protein CIB and promotes integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3)-mediated adhesion and spreading.
At the mechanistic levels, treatment with the aRVS extract led to the downregulation of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins, the activation of caspase-9/-3 proteins, an increase in cytosolic cytochrome?c levels, the upregulation of Bax protein, an increase in phosphorylated p53 protein but a decrease in phosphorylated S6 protein in the A549 cells.
GST-Yih1 overexpression did not significantly affect Gcn1-ribosome or Gcn2-ribosome cosedimentation.
TGF-?1 targets Smad, p38 MAPK, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways to induce PFKFB3 gene expression and glycolysis in glioblastoma cells.
SMAD proteins are canonical TGFB signaling components consisting of receptor-regulated SMADs (SMAD1/2/3/5/9), a common SMAD (SMAD4), and inhibitory SMADs (SMAD6/7).
In the cell body, galectin-3 colocalizes with melanosome-destined cargo, specifically tyrosinase and Tyrp-1.
Ribosomal protein L4 is a novel regulator of the MDM2-p53 loop.
BMP-induced nuclear translocation of receptor-activated Smads was inhibited by HGF, providing a possible explanation of how HGF inhibits BMP signaling.
Synergistic effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation was also detected by TNF-alpha and activating beta1 integrin antibody, whereas inhibitory antibody to beta1 integrin attenuated FN and TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2.
These are PARK2, encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin; PINK1, a mitochondrial kinase; and PARK7, which codes for the protein DJ-1.
S1P-mediated IL-8 secretion is regulated by PTX, extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).
We investigated changes in interleukin-8 (IL-8) mediated neutrophil migration and associated changes in receptor expression, of the IL-8 receptors CXCR1, the integrins CD11b/CD18 and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) in patients sustaining major trauma.
Together, these data demonstrate that syntaxin 4, VAMP2, and/or VAMP3/cellubrevin can function as target membrane and vesicle SNAP receptors, respectively, for insulin-responsive GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane.
Tob proteins enhance inhibitory Smad-receptor interactions to repress BMP signaling.
After transfection with MMP-9 siRNA, the intracellular and extracellular MMP-9 proteins were both efficiently decreased, as the soluble FasL protein, while the intracellular FasL protein was increased.
These vesicles selectively and persistently mediated TrkA-erk5 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling.
Among these are the cytokines, integrins, heat shock proteins, tastin and trophinin.
