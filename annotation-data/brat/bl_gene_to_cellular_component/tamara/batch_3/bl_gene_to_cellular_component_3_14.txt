Pretreatment of insulin with anti-insulin antibody or the cells with anti-insulin receptor antibody inhibited the effect of insulin.
Finally, Tob associates with receptor-regulated Smads (Smad1, 5, and 8) and colocalizes with these Smads in the nuclear bodies upon BMP2 stimulation.
Mechanistically, Cables1 interferes with the proteasome (Prosome, Macropain) subunit alpha type 3 (PSMA3) binding to p21 and protects p21 from PSMA3-mediated proteasomal degradation.
Conversely, excretory systems were tested with plasma membrane vesicles from Sf21 insect cells expressing human ABCB11, ABCC2, ABCC3, and ABCG2.
The alpha1beta1 integrin is a major cell surface receptor for collagen.
Role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and the Cbl adaptor protein in coupling the alpha4beta1 integrin to mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling.
Ca2+ and calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous synaptic vesicle tubulin by a vesicle-bound calmodulin kinase system.
Whereas GGA1- or GGA3-depletion increased EGFR expression, GGA2-depletion by RNAi greatly reduced steady-state expression of EGFR, reflecting enhanced lysosomal degradation of EGFR.
These cell lines, except the HLEC-1 cell line, produced the following human plasma proteins among those examined: albumin, prealbumin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin, fibrinogen, fibronectin, haptoglobin, hemopexin, beta-lipoprotein, alpha 2-macroglobulin, beta 2-microglobulin, transferrin, lipoprotein, alpha 2-macroglobulin, beta 2-microglobulin, transferrin, Complement Components 3 and 4, and alpha 1-fetoprotein.
CD34, CD31, and CXCR4) and integrins (integrins ?5, ?1 and ?2).
Moreover, morin negatively regulates adhesion and CXCL12-dependent migration of Mec-1 cells by affecting VLA-4 integrin expression and CXCR4 receptor recycling.
Proteomic analysis of XAV939-treated myotubes identified down-regulation of several glucose transporter GLUT4 storage vesicle (GSV) proteins including RAB10, VAMP8, SORT1, and GLUT4.
By measuring Smad-specific phosphorylation and Smad-responsive promoter activity, endoglin was shown to constitutively activate Smad1, with little-to-no effect upon Smad3.
We further demonstrate that the migfilin interaction dissociates filamin from integrin and promotes the talin/integrin binding and integrin activation.
In conclusion, we show that: 1) TGF-beta receptor Type II is predominantly located on basolateral membrane and receptor stimulation activates Smad pathway; 2) TGF-beta1 down-regulates IL-6-induced tyrosine phoshorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 and ICAM-1 expression; and 3) Smad2 is required for the down-regulation of IL-6 signaling by TGF-beta.
Among overexpressed proteins were transcription factors (nucleoside diphosphate kinase 1) and enzymes involved in gene silencing (chromobox protein), protein synthesis (39S ribosomal protein L12, BiP protein, protein disulfide isomerase), degradation (cytosol aminopeptidase, endopeptidase Clp, inorganic pyrophosphatase) and energy metabolism (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, pyruvate dehydrogenase), heat-shock proteins (60 and 70 kd), structural proteins (cytokeratins) and membrane proteins (stomatinlike protein 2).
Moreover, the nodes in the module were significantly enriched in ribosomal protein (RPL17, ribosomal protein L17 and MRPL22, mitochondrial ribosomal protein L22) and proteasome (PSMA6, proteasome subunit, alpha type 6, PSMA4)-related domains.
Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) controls osteoblast proliferation and differentiation through Smad proteins.
B23 physiologically bound to both SIAH1 and GAPDH, disrupting the SIAH1-GAPDH complex in the nucleus in response to nitrosative stress.
The NCL family of proteins is comprised of lysosomal enzymes (PPT1/CLN1, TPP1/CLN2, CTSD/CLN10, CTSF/CLN13), proteins that peripherally associate with membranes (DNAJC5/CLN4, KCTD7/CLN14), a soluble lysosomal protein (CLN5), a protein present in the secretory pathway (PGRN/CLN11), and several proteins that display different subcellular localizations (CLN3, CLN6, MFSD8/CLN7, CLN8, ATP13A2/CLN12).
