Matrix/integrin interaction activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase, p44erk-1 and p42erk-2.
The protein ATG16L1 suppresses inflammatory cytokines induced by the intracellular sensors Nod1 and Nod2 in an autophagy-independent manner.
Within groups I, II and III, we found some genes known to be involved in oligosaccharide biosynthesis (ALG9, ALG12, HOC1), secretion (BRE5, COD4/COG5, VPS53), transcription (YOL072w/THP1, ELP2, STB1, SNF11), cell polarity (SEP7, RDG1), mitochondrial function (YFH1), cell metabolism, as well as orphan genes.
Interaction of Rab3B with microtubule-binding protein Gas8 in NIH 3T3 cells.
TOR complex 2 (TORC2) contains Tor2 but not Tor1 and controls polarity of the actin cytoskeleton via the Rho1/Pkc1/MAPK cell integrity cascade.
Further exploration showed that TLR9 deficiency prevented the increment of p38 MAPK phosphorylation and reduction of Akt/Gsk-3? phosphorylation; TLR9 deficiency also attenuated the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into cytoplasm, caused upregulation of Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio, downregulation of cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP, as well as decreased TUNEL-positive cells in macrophage of stressed mice.
Western blot analyses with antibodies specific for Ser5 phosphorylated L-plastin confirmed the reduced L-plastin Ser5 phosphorylation in Lrrk1 knockout (KO) osteoclasts.
Conclusion: Our findings not only illustrate a function of Dyrk3 in reprograming HCC metabolism by negatively regulating NCOA3/ATF4 transcription factor complex but also identify NCOA3 as a phosphorylation substrate of Dyrk3, suggesting the Dyrk3/NCOA3/ATF4 axis as a potential candidate for HCC therapy.
SOSTDC1 suppresses both BMP-7-induced phosphorylation of R-Smads-1, -5, and -8 and Wnt-3a signaling.
The cytoplasmic domain of the p80 TNF receptor associates with a protein kinase, termed p80TRAK, that phosphorylates both the p60 and p80 TNF receptors.
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) form one of the largest superfamilies of membrane proteins.
Immunoenzymology of acetylcholinesterase. I. Substrate specificity and heat stability of acetylcholinesterase and of acetylcholinesterase-antibody complex.
These approaches target the collagen receptor glycoprotein (GP) VI, the GPIb/von Willebrand factor axis, the thrombin receptor PAR-1, the activated form of integrin ?IIb?3 or the ADP receptor P2Y1.
BMP-Smad1 signaling can also be attenuated by BMP-induced expression of the inhibitory Smads, which are negative regulators of Smad1 transactivation activity and/or BMP antagonists.
The platelet plasma membrane is lined with a membrane skeleton composed of short actin filaments, actin-binding protein, spectrin, vinculin, and other unidentified proteins.
TGFbeta signals are transduced to the nucleus by the Smad family of proteins, which includes Smad7, an inhibitory SMAD, which acts as a negative regulator of TGFbeta.
Furthermore, we show that both ALK1 and ALK5 are needed for TGF-beta-induced phosphorylation of intracellular mediators Smad1/5, whereas only ALK5 is essential for TGF-beta1-induced phosphorylation of Smad3.
Transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of the integrin collagen receptor locus ITGA1-PELO-ITGA2.
Genes encoding cardiac muscle proteins (Myh6, Mybpc3 and Tnn2), intercellular proteins (Gja1 and Gja4), intracellular Ca(2+) transport (Atp2a1 and Ryr2), cell membrane transport (Atp1a2 and Atp1b1) and potassium channel proteins (Kcnj2 and Kcnj8) were upregulated and genes encoding cardiac muscle proteins (Myh7) were downregulated in control rats fed sucrose compared with control rats.
Furthermore, p37 promoted the phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase and the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2).
