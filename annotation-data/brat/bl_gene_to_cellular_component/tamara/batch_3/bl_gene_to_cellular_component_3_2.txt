It also binds to chromatin-associated proteins and transcriptional regulators, including the R-Smads, Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3.
Experiments with fractionated microtubule proteins indicate that tubulin-free microtubule associated proteins bind to DNA, while tubulin free of microtubule-associated proteins does not.
We show that the membrane-deforming protein SGIP1 (Src homology 3-domain growth factor receptor-bound 2-like (endophilin) interacting protein 1) and the signaling adaptor Reps1 (RalBP associated Eps15-homology domain protein) interact with ITSN1 in vivo.
EGF concentration in sera, anti-EGF antibodies and their capacity to inhibit the binding between EGF/EGF receptor (EGFR), and the EGFR phosphorylation were measured.
Moreover, BSAE attenuated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) and extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2) phosphorylations.
Downregulation of MUC1 expression also induced beta-catenin relocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, increased E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex formation and E-cadherin membrane localization in PANC1 cells.
Rab11FIP proteins link endocytic recycling vesicles for cytoskeletal transport and tethering.
On entry into mitosis, Cbx2, Ring1b, Mel18, and Phc1 proteins become immobilized at mitotic chromosomes, whereas other Cbx-family proteins dynamically bind to mitotic chromosomes.
We show that the protein Miro1 links mitochondria to KIF5 motor proteins, allowing mitochondria to move along microtubules.
The membranes were probed for phosphorylated Smad and total Smad to indicate activation of TGF-beta signalling.
Basement membrane localization of Frem3 is independent of the Fras1/Frem1/Frem2 protein complex within the sublamina densa.
Cell viability, apoptosis induction and mitochondrial transmembrane potential were determined and the expression levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins (Cdk2, cyclin E, p27 and c-myc) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) protein were detected.
Purified NeuN-High nuclei expressed significantly higher levels of transcripts encoding markers of neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, and learning and memory (ARC, BDNF, ERG1, HOMER1, NFL/NEF1, SYT1), subunits of chromatin modifying machinery (SIRT1, HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC11, KAT2B, KAT3A, KAT3B, KAT5, DMNT1, DNMT3A, Gadd45a, Gadd45b) and markers of NPC and cell cycle activity (BRN2, FOXG1, KLF4, c-MYC, OCT4, PCNA, SHH, SOX2) relative to neuronal NeuN-Low or to mostly non-neuronal NeuN-Neg nuclei.
The insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins are major components of IIS, which transmit upstream signals via the insulin receptor and/or IGF1 receptor to multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including AKT/protein kinase B and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase cascades.
In the cytoplasm, p21(Cip1/Waf1) protein has an anti-apoptotic effect.
Expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase, myoblast determination protein 1, myogenic factor 5, myogenic regulatory factor-4, m-calpain, calpastatin, IGF-I and myostatin was similar between treatments.
The ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases comprises four members: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ErbB1, HER2/ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4, and plays roles in signal transduction at the plasma membrane upon ligand stimulation.
Furthermore, exogenous GDF11 decreases BMP-SMAD signalling, enhances SMAD ubiquitin regulatory factor 1 (SMURF1) expression and induces ERK1/2 (MAPK3/1) signalling.
Blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor, beta1 integrin, or Src significantly inhibited neuronal differentiation.
Integrin-associated tyrosine kinase FAK affects Cbfa1 expression.
