Evidence for binding of gastrin to ligandin, a cell cytosol protein.
Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling via Smad proteins occurs in various cell types.
Overexpressed proteins include stress proteins, proteins involved in protein biosynthesis, proteins responsible for energy production, proteins involved in free radicals detoxification by the glutathione system, outer membrane proteins, MucD, while downregulated proteins were isocitrate dehydrogenase and 30S ribosomal protein S1.
MAN1, an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane, inhibits TGF-? signaling by binding to Smad2 and Smad3.
P < 0.01), and decreased Akt1 protein and cytosolic FOXO1 and FOXO3 phosphorylation.
This apoptosis-like cell death activated key molecules in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway: cytochrome c, caspase-9, caspase-7, and caspase-6.
Integrin-induced focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation as well as insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin activate MAP kinase.
In contrast, EGFR associates with Sdc4 and the ?6?4 integrin, and EGFR-dependent motility depends on cytoplasmic engagement of ?4 integrin with Sdc4.
Osteopontin (OPN) is a pleiotropic integrin-binding protein with many functions.
Crossveinless 2 (CV-2) is an extracellular BMP modulator protein belonging to the Chordin family.
MDM2-p53 complexes in the nucleus are transported to the cytoplasm via signals present in the MDM2 protein, where p53 is degraded in the proteasome.
The G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) fMLP receptor (FPR) and the two receptors tyrosine kinase (RTK), the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor TrkA and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) are involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) production and CD11b membrane integrin upregulation.
Loss of PCM1 blocks ciliogenesis by abrogating recruitment of ciliary vesicles associated with the Talpid3-binding protein, Rab8, which can be reversed by inactivating Mib1.
Whereas VEGF and S1P increased both p42/p44 extracellular regulated kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activities, only p38 MAP kinase inhibition significantly reduced VEGF- and S1P-stimulated migration.
TMA sections were stained using antibodies against proteins in various DNA repair pathways including XPF, FANCD2, PAR, MLH1, PARP1, and phosphorylated MAPKAP kinase 2 (pMK2).
BMP4 treatment activated the Smad signaling pathway, and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) pathways in these cells.
Other results suggest that INA-1 (? integrin) and MIG-15 (NIK kinase) signaling mediate the response in HSN.
Finally, we show that the incisures also contain four other PDZ proteins that are found in epithelial tight junctions, including three membrane-associated guanylate-kinase proteins (membrane-associated guanylate-kinase inverted-2, ZO-1, and ZO-2) and the adaptor protein Par-3.
The activity of the core TGF-beta signaling pathway was assessed using TGF-beta1 binding assays, phospho-specific Smad antibodies, immunofluorescent staining of Smad and Smad DNA binding assays.
TLN1 encodes talin 1-a large cytoplasmic protein of the integrin adhesion complex that links the actin cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix.
