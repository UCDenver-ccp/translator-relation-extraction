Thus, inhibition of p38 MAPK substantially reduces inflammatory cytokine up-regulation of Stx-receptor synthesis and cell-surface expression, thereby decreasing Stx cytotoxicity.
The intricacies of p21 phosphorylation: protein/protein interactions, subcellular localization and stability.
Calcineurin, a calmodulin-binding protein, inhibits the calmodulin-stimulated phosphodiesterase activity by competing with the enzyme for calmodulin.
Here, we show how neuroplastin-65 activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (p38MAPK) modified synapse strength by altering surface glutamate receptor expression.
Genes including Glut4, IRS1, PPAR-?, PGC1 and Sirt1 were downregulated, whereas uncoupling protein UCP3 was up-regulated, in accordance with mitochondrial dysfunction.
Integrin alpha8beta1 and several additional RGD-binding integrins bind nephronectin.
TMEPAI, a transmembrane TGF-beta-inducible protein, sequesters Smad proteins from active participation in TGF-beta signaling.
Twelve were extracellular matrix proteins, including the basement membrane proteins type IV collagen, nidogen-1, agrin and fibulin-1.
CNPY3 bound TLR2, and cells with knockdown of CNPY3 or HuR lost membrane localization of TLR2, but increased cytoplasmic levels of TLR2.
We describe changes in the expression and localization of BMP receptors (Bmpr1a, Bmpr1b, and Bmpr2) and Smad (Smad1, Smad4, Smad5, and Smad8) intracellular signaling proteins during the saccular and alveolarization stages of late lung development.
Thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR) is a cytokine receptor protein present on the cell surface.
The ERM (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) proteins belong to the band-4.1 superfamily of membrane-cytoskeleton-linking proteins which bind to the actin cytoskeleton via their C-terminal sequences and bind ERM binding membrane proteins (ERMBMPs).
Fifteen identified proteins with important functions in metabolic pathways (thioredoxin reductase, thioredoxin, thioredoxin peroxidase 1, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, plasmoredoxin, mitochondrial dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase 1, glyoxalase I and II, ornithine ?-aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH], pyruvate kinase [PK], and phosphoglycerate mutase) were further analyzed to study their ability to form mixed disulfides with glutathione.
SMAD6 is a crucial feedback inhibitory regulator of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD signalling.
The INF2 mutants perturbed the INF2-MAL-CDC42 pathway, resulting in cytoskeleton disorganization, enhanced INF2 binding to CDC42 and mislocalization of INF2, MAL, and CDC42.
The primary cognate HB-EGF receptor, ErbB1, has been shown recently to be transactivated by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) through regulated proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound, precursor form of HB-EGF.
Compared with wild-type Notch1, membrane-tethered Notch1 was strongly associated with activated EGFR-PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.
Further downstream mediators of S1P induced COX-2 expression appear to be extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).
Mechanochemical sensing molecules, polycystins, and alpha2-, alpha5-, and beta1-integrins were enriched in cilia, as was EGF receptor, known to activate jointly with integrins during cell migration.
ILBCs also lack beta-catenin expression and show aberrant cytoplasmic localization of the E-cadherin binding protein p120-catenin.
