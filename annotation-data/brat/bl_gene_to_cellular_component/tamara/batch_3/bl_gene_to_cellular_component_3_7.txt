Taken together, we conclude that Rufy3 is a physiological adapter for Rap2 and activates Tiam2/STEF in glycoprotein M6A-regulated neuronal polarity and axon growth.
The Ndc80 complex, comprised of Ndc80 (Hec1), Nuf2, Spc24, and Spc25, is essential for metaphase chromosome alignment and anaphase chromosome segregation.
Phosphorylation of neurofilament proteins by protein kinase C.
PCSK9 is a natural inhibitor of LDL receptor (LDLR) that binds the extracellular domain of LDLR and triggers its intracellular degradation.
Data obtained from immunoblots of Runx2-, Smad3- or Smad4-transfected cells and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that Runx2 interacts with Smad3 at the SBE.
Synaptotagmin-like protein 2 (Slp2-a/Sytl2) is a Rab27 effector protein that regulates transport of Rab27-bearing vesicles and organelles through its N-terminal Rab27-binding domain and a phospholipid-binding C2A domain.
Mitotic chromatin regulates phosphorylation of Stathmin/Op18.
Interactions of cytosolic G protein coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) with activated G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) induce receptor phosphorylation and desensitization.
Intracellular phosphorylated p38 MAPK (Pp38 MAPK) in IgE-activated basophils can be quantified flow cytometrically.
beta(2) Integrin Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) aggregation was induced by antibody cross-linking of the integrins on the cell surface.
Active Cdk5 changes the cellular localization by cleavage of p35 to p25; p35/Cdk5 is associated with membrane or cytoskeletons, but p25/Cdk5 is a soluble protein.
; cCASP3: cleaved caspase 3; CSNK2: casein kinase 2; FTLD: frontotemporal lobar degeneration; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; OPTN: optineurin; PTK2/FAK: PTK2 protein tyrosine kinase 2; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TARDBP/TDP-43: TAR DNA binding protein; TBK1: TANK binding kinase 1; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; UPS: ubiquitin-proteasome system.
MAP kinase activity was assessed using an anti-active MAP kinase antibody and direct measurement of MAP kinase catalyzed phosphorylation of myelin basic protein, MBP-(95-98).
Exogenous expression of BMP7 increased the ORI-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, while the BMP7 antibody almost abolished the ORI-elevated p38 MAPK phosphorylation.
Inhibition of MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation by ribosomal protein L5.
Smad7 prevents phosphorylation of receptor-activated Smads, thereby inhibiting TGF-beta-induced signaling responses [1].
Second, during validation by immunohistochemistry, we observed that antibodies directed against 15 markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and/or mitochondrial translation (AKAP1, GOLPH3, GOLPH3L, MCT1, MRPL40, MRPS7, MRPS15, MRPS22, NRF1, NRF2, PGC1-?, POLRMT, TFAM, TIMM9 and TOMM70A) selectively labeled epithelial breast cancer cells.
Here, we show that there is a bidirectional cross-modulation of beta1-integrin and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.
ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) proteins recognize the cytoplasmic domains of adhesion molecules in the formation of the membrane-associated cytoskeleton.
Claspin interacts with many factors involved in checkpoint regulation and replication fork machinery, including ATR, ATM, Chk1, Tim, MCM4, MCM10, Cdc45, DNA polymerases ?, ?, ? and Cdc7 kinase.
