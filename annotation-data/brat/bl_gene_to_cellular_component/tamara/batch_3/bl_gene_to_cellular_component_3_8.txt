Similar inhibition of TRH receptor-G protein coupling was observed with tubulin antibodies and purified tubulin, suggesting that perturbation of membrane-associated tubulin and/or tubulin-G protein interaction by these compounds disrupts receptor-G protein interaction.
Extreme Insulin Resistance From Insulin Antibodies (Not Insulin Receptor Antibodies) Successfully Treated With Combination Immunosuppressive Therapy.
The GAPDH-Siah1 protein complex, in turn, translocates to the nucleus and mediates cell death; these processes are blocked by procedures that interfere with GAPDH-Siah1 binding.
Transmembrane proteins detected in the membrane fraction included transporters, channels, receptors, and unknown molecules, whereas the remaining proteins, categorized as membrane-anchored proteins, included small GTPases, GTPase binding proteins, heat shock protein 70-like proteins, ribosomal proteins, and unknown proteins.
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are an important, medically relevant class of integral membrane proteins.
Antibody-coated microparticles demonstrated that protein kinase C ? inhibition down-regulated E-selectin and ICAM-1 but not VCAM-1 expression.
Phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated protein kinase (phospho-ERK1/2) and phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) protein levels were significantly up-regulated, while PPAR? protein level was down-regulated in TAC rats.
A large number of proteins, such as plasma membrane proteins EGFR and Erbb2, are up-regulated in glioblastoma.
APC is implicated in spindle formation by direct interactions with tubulin and microtubule-binding protein EB1.
Secretory phospholipase A2 (s-PLA2) and Lipoprotein-associated PLA2 (Lp-PLA2) are inflammatory enzymes associated with atherosclerosis.
Soluble alpha1beta1 integrin bound immobilized RR virus, and peptides representing the alpha1beta1 integrin binding-site on collagen IV inhibited virus binding to cells.
Downstream, TGFbeta1 activated Smad-dependent signaling, and Smad-independent pathways that included PI3 kinase, p38, and JNK MAP kinase, but only inhibition of the Smad-dependent pathway blocked Jagged1 expression.
Dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase 3 or PYST1) dephosphorylates phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine residues on extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2; MAPK1/2) to inactivate the ERK1/2 kinase.
Furthermore, OGD downregulated tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin levels, and increased the expressions of inflammatory cytokines TNF-?, ICAM-1, and complement C3a receptor (C3aR).
EC141 down-regulated Hsp90 and up-regulated Hsp70 protein levels, inhibited CrkL phosphorylation, and induced degradation of Bcr-Abl p190 protein through ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal pathway.
Cd induction enhanced phospholipases (PLA2 s) activities, specifically the secretory PLA2 and cytosolic PLA2 .
Competition between Ski and CREB-binding protein for binding to Smad proteins in transforming growth factor-beta signaling.
The cell wall of Streptococcus mutans upregulated the expression of TLR4 and induced the production of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, indicating that the expression of TLR4 of EAhy926 cells may elicit a TLR4-mediated innate immune response and contribute to production of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8.
These anti-CCN3 antibodies stained CCN3 protein which was localized to cytoplasmic stores, cell membranes and extracellular matrix.
Overexpressed proteins included beta-5-tubulin, beta-actin, vimentin, hypermethylated in cancer 2 protein, heat-shock 70-kDa protein 9B, serum albumin, 39S ribosomal protein L45, butyrophilin, autoimmune regulator, and transcription factor ETV7. Underexpressed proteins included BiP protein, superoxide dismutase, peroxiredoxin 2, inoraganic pyrophosphatase, keratin 8, carbonic anhydrase 1, repulsive guidance molecule, catalase, C-1-tetrahydrofolate synthase, and hemoglobin alpha-2.
