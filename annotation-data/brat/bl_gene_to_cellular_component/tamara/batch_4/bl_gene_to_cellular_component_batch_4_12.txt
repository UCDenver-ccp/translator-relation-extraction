Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional protein that modulates cell proliferation and interaction with the extracellular matrix.
In an ex vivo setting, IL-10 recombinant protein augmented the expression of Foxp3, downregulated the expression of IL-2 and interferon gamma, and induced the generation of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) and CD8(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) cells, but this effect was blocked by the administration of IL-10 antibody.
Phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein by S6K1 regulates the translation of both ribosomal proteins and initiation factors, leading to an increase in protein synthesis.
The long-form leptin receptor (LepR) regulates multiple intracellular signaling cascades, including the classic Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways.
An unbiased screen shows that Vps35 and Vps26 are found in complex with MAPL, and confocal imaging reveals Vps35 recruitment to mitochondrial vesicles.
GLUT12 expression was predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas GLUT1 was associated with the membrane of the cells.
CD10 expression was limited to the cytoplasm, whereas Bcl10 expression was detected in the cytoplasm and/or nuclei.
A Rac1-FMNL2 signaling module affects cell-cell contact formation independent of Cdc42 and membrane protrusions.
Insulin and GCK proteins were detected in the cytoplasmic region of the resulting cells, whereas GLUT2 was predominantly expressed in the nucleus.
Cyclin-dependent kinase activating kinase (CAK) is a trimeric complex composed of cdk7, cyclin H and MAT1.
Furthermore, this increase in polysome-bound rpL32 mRNA was accompanied by the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p70 S6 kinase (S6K1), and S6 ribosomal protein.
The N-terminal part of ICL3 is needed to activate Jak2 after SDF-1alpha binding to CXCR4, leading to phosphorylation of only one cytoplasmic Tyr, present at the C terminus of ICL2, which triggers STAT3 activation.
Knockdown experiments by RNAi confirm that the centrosome phosphorylation of CDC25B on S353 depends on Aurora-A kinase.
Recent studies have demonstrated that overexpression of MUC1 interferes with cell-substrate and cell-cell adhesion by masking cell surface integrins and E-cadherin.
Clinical parameters, neuropsychological tests, high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), lipoprotein-associated Phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) mass and activity were measured.
After the differentiation, these cells expressed tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine transporter, dopamine D1 receptor and synapse-associated protein synapsin I. Several genes, Nurr1, Lmx1b, and En1, which are critically related with the development of dopaminergic neurons, were also significantly up-regulated.
Specific thyronamines, particularly 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM), stimulate with nanomolar affinity trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a G protein-coupled membrane receptor, and may also interact with other TAAR subtypes (particularly TAAR5), adrenergic receptors (particularly Î±2 receptors), amine transporters, and mitochondrial proteins.
The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) promotes anaphase onset and mitotic exit through ubiquitinating securin and cyclin B1.
Stimulation of RASF with leptin activated IkappaB kinase alpha/beta (IKK alpha/beta), p65 phosphorylation at Ser(276), p65 translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus, and kappaB-luciferase activity.
SMAD7 acts as an intracellular negative regulator that prevents SMAD2/3 activation and promotes degradation of ActRIIB complexes.
