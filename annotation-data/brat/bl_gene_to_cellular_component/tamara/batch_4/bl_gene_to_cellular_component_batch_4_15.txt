As a result, uPA-dependent focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and integrin-mediated EGFR signaling are suppressed.
Transfecting H460 cells with mKeap1-pEGFP and screenig for Keap1 expressing clones by Western blotting with antibodies against Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1 and AKR1C.
(4) The 130 kDa protein immunoprecipitated by anti-vinculin monoclonal antibody reacts with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody; when immunoprecipitated by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody it reacts with anti-vinculin antibody.
These experiments illustrated that the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinases are critical to the increased production of interleukin-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in response to IL-33.
IRF-1 protein was predominantly cytoplasmic during this treatment.
Foxc1 Expression in Early Osteogenic Differentiation Is Regulated by BMP4-SMAD Activity.
Extracellular signal-regulated kinase and the small GTP-binding protein p21Rac1 are involved in the regulation of gene transcription by angiotensin II.
Regulation of melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 signaling by RGS8 with the receptor third intracellular loop.
In this study, we investigated the expression of vitronectin receptor-type integrins and osteopontin in ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization, and examined the role of osteopontin in angiogenesis as a ligand of vitronectin receptor-type integrins.
The present studies were undertaken to examine the role of the cytoplasmic tail of the G protein-coupled receptor for PTH and PTH-related protein (PTHrP) on receptor signaling and expression.
Chemotactic properties were abolished by pretreating cells with heparinase, chondroitinase, sodium chlorate, and anti-syndecan-4 antibodies, indicating the involvement of syndecan-4.
These data suggest distinct initial and sustained phases of integrin-mediated Raf activation that require Raf membrane localization and possibly PKC activity, respectively, and that integrin-mediated adhesion may regulate a cytoskeleton-associated factor(s) responsible for Raf activation.
Moreover, only Slit2-N membranes or purified protein-induced OB growth cones collapse.
The SRF target gene and actin-binding protein, vinculin, is sufficient to overcome the axonal growth deficits of SRF-deficient and GSK-3-inhibited neurons.
Cryopyrin (also called Nalp3), the product of CIAS1, is a member of the NOD-LRR protein family that has been linked to the activation of intracellular host defence signalling pathways.
Multiple molecular interactions determine the clustering of Caspr2 and Kv1 channels in myelinated axons.
Lamin A/C-dependent localization of Nesprin-2, a giant scaffolder at the nuclear envelope.
Membrane vesicles prepared from ABCB5 baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells showed higher vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity than the Sf21 control vesicles.
Even after depolymerisation of microfilaments and microtubules, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt were maintained in Vim(-/-) cells.
Hence, by identifying the interaction between integrin β4 and annexin A7, we demonstrated that both annexin A7 and integrin β4 were essential for small molecule ABO-induced autophagy and targeting annexin A7 by ABO could modulate integrin β4 phosphorylation, while Y-1494 phosphorylation of integrin β4 may negatively regulate autophagy.
