The results revealed significant expression levels of mRNA for reelin, one reelin receptor, very low density lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr), and the cytoplasmic adaptor molecule, disabled homolog 1 (Dab1).
Cyclophillin B and FK-associated binding protein, calcineurin A (alpha and beta), and NFATC3 and NFAT5 were detected in hTBEC cultures by RT-PCR.
GRP1 and cytohesin-1 appear to connect receptor-activated PI 3-kinase signaling pathways with proteins that mediate biological responses such as cell adhesion and membrane trafficking.
The A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) GSK3β interaction protein (GSKIP) is a cytosolic scaffolding protein binding protein kinase A (PKA) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β).
Taking advantage of a monoclonal antibody neutralizing extracellular S1P, we show that inhibition of S1P extracellular signaling blocks HIF-2α accumulation in ccRCC cell lines, an effect mimicked when the S1P transporter Spns2 or the S1P receptor 1 (S1P1) is silenced.
Troponin T and GATA4 antibodies were used as cardiogenic markers, whereas myogenin and MyoD antibodies were used as myocyte markers.
By inhibiting MIG6 expression, miR-148a reduced EGFR trafficking to Rab7-expressing compartments, which includes late endosomes and lysosomes.
Apparently both proteins were localized in the pregranulosa cells, Rspo1 in the cytoplasm and Foxl2 in the nucleus.
Proteomics analysis of mitochondrial proteins reveals overexpression of a mitochondrial protein chaperon, prohibitin, in cells expressing hepatitis C virus core protein.
C7 cells also expressed Mitf protein in their nuclei.
Therefore, Akt promotes cell-cycle progression through the mechanisms of phosphorylation-dependent 14-3-3 binding to p27(Kip1) and cytoplasmic localization.
We have previously shown that Sedlin interacts with the intracellular chloride channel proteins CLIC1 and CLIC2 in the cytoplasm.
Previous studies showed that the level of MSH2 protein is modulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) serves as an ubiquitin E3 ligase.
Mammalian chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) (p64-related) proteins are widely expressed, with an unusual dual localization as both soluble and integral membrane proteins.
Intracellular proteins including NOD2, NF-κB and proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-8, IL-6 in the cell supernatant were analyzed by ELISA.
Immunohistochemically, GST-P-positive lesions were devoid of intracytoplasmic nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression, whereas GST-P-negative lesions expressed higher levels of cytoplasmic Nrf2.
Upon EWS-FLI1 silencing, NOTCH3 processing accompanied by nuclear translocation of the activated intracellular domain was observed in all but one p53-mutant cell line.
Thus, we measured the activities of catalase (CAT), soluble and membrane associated glutathione-S-transferases (s- and m-GSTs) and glutathione reductase (GR), as well as the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content.
Moreover, Sam68 was redistributed from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and interacts with cellular factors, such as (polyrC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), during EV71 infection.
Developmental endothelial locus-1 attenuates complement-dependent phagocytosis through inhibition of Mac-1-integrin.
