After the application of anti-STEAP4 antibodies at 0.002 mg/mL, adipocytes exhibited reduced insulin-stimulated glucose transport by attenuating the phosphorylation of IRS-1, PI3K (p85), and Akt.
In this way, Evi-1 acts as a general Smad corepressor to inhibit TGF-beta-, activin-, and BMP-inducible transcription.
Bortezomib reduced TRAF6 protein expression through autophagy-mediated lysosomal degradation.
Mechanistically, we found that binding of caveolin-1 to Ku70 inhibits the chemotherapeutic drug-induced release of Bax from Ku70, activation of Bax, translocation of Bax to mitochondria and apoptosis.
Recently, we reported that tethering and rolling of neutrophils in shear flow over a substrate of E-selectin signals activation of beta 2-integrins and firm adhesion via an intracellular signaling pathway involving phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase.
We show that NRP-1 forms a complex with GIPC1 and α6/β4-integrin to activate FAK/Src signaling, which leads to stabilization of a YAP1/∆Np63α to enhance ECS cell survival, invasion, and angiogenesis.
This involves the action of histone chaperones, nucleosome-remodeling enzymes, histone and DNA methylation binding proteins, and chromatin-modifying enzymes.
These biomarkers include calreticulin, fibrinogen-γ, superoxide dismutase, vimentin, malate dehydrogenase, and lamin B2.
ORF62 protein cannot influence the intracellular distribution of ORF4 protein without NLS.
Inhibition by antibodies against 45-kd outer membrane proteins strongly suggests the existence of a mitochondrial surface protein mediating protein import and offers a means of isolating this protein.
IL-10 reduced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and decreased the expression of full-length membrane spanning tumor necrosis factor-alpha (mTNFalpha) following lipopolysaccharide stimulation of microglia in vitro.
Using a polyclonal anti-alpha-DB antibody, we have investigated its expression, localization and association with tight junction (TJ)- associated proteins (ZO-1, occludin) before and after protein kinase C (PKC) activation with phorbol myristate acetate.
Cullin-5 (Cul-5), a member of the cullin gene family of scaffold proteins of E3 ubiquitin-ligase complexes, has a role in proteolysis and cell cycle regulation.
Using the cross-linker disuccinimidyl tartrate, covalent linking of the galanin receptor to 125I-galanin in membranes from Rin14B cells, followed by SDS/PAGE analysis of membrane proteins, indicated that the galanin receptor is a protein of 54 kDa.
Mechanistically, polyphyllin D dissipates the mitochondrial membrane potential, induces a downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression and an up-regulation of pro-apoptotic Bax expression, and activates caspase-9.
To investigate whether IL-1beta activates MAP kinases [extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) and p38 MAP kinase (p38 MAPK)] and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. a transcription factor, in gastric epithelial cells (RGM1).
We identified a list of 18 genes (NLRP3, AIM2, PYCARD, NAIP, Caspase-4, Caspase-7, Caspase-8, TLR1, TLR7, TOLLIP, NFKBIA, TNF, TNFAIP3, INFGR2, P2RX7, IL-1B, IL1RL1, IL-18) closely related to inflammasome complex, indicating an important role of inflammation/immunity in EAOC transformation.
Concurrently, ox-LDL treatment enhanced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (P<0.05
In contrast, phosphorylated Smad2 significantly accumulated in the nucleus as a consequence of depletion of WNK1, resulting in Smad-mediated transcriptional responses.
In H-RAS V12 cells, membrane associated PDK-1 was phosphorylated at Y373/376, which was abolished by the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2.
