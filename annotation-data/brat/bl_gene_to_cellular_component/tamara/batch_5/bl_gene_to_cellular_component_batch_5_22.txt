G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are cell membrane protein receptors that transduce signals across the cell membrane and are important targets for therapeutic interventions.
We have shown recently that IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor rapidly activate a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor, acute-phase response factor (APRF), by tyrosine phosphorylation, which then binds to IL-6 response elements of various IL-6 target genes.
The Pex1 and Pex6 proteins are members of the AAA family of ATPases and are involved in peroxisome biogenesis.
HSP72/Hpa2), ER-EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding proteins (calumenin) and the proteasome activator PA28 (PSME2), tends to be 'restored', i.e., in BHK cells over-expressing F508del/4RK-CFTR those proteins tend to have expression levels similar to the wild-type ones.
The CXXC motif, the active site of the protein-disulfide-isomerase (PDI) family, is expressed twice in this domain of all integrins across species.
Meanwhile, after ATRA treatments, p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1) proteins mainly localized in the nucleus, and their concentrations in cytoplasm decreased.
In vivo, clustering of ligand-bound integrins may enhance signaling by increasing the local concentration of intracellular integrin-associated proteins.
Interleukin-7 (IL-7) inhibits TGF-beta signaling by up-regulating Smad7, a major inhibitor of the Smad family.
The cytoplasmic protein beta-catenin is a multifunctional protein and a central molecule in the Wnt signaling pathway.
Their integrin binding was measured by protein interaction ELISAs.
Before HD, patients presented anaemia and significant changes in membrane protein composition, namely, a statistically significant reduction in spectrin associated with a significant increase in bands 6, as well as an altered membrane protein interaction (protein 4.1/spectrin, protein 4.1/band 3, protein 4.2/band 3 and spectrin/band 3).
However, it stimulated osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization by specifically facilitating BMP-SMAD signaling pathway in vitro.
Given the preferential distribution of αvβ3-integrin to epithelial cells, we propose that αvβ3-integrin serves as coreceptor of TLR2 in these cells.
Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C attenuates extracellular matrix protein-induced vascular smooth muscle cell chemotaxis.
The inhibitory effect of ErbB2 on epidermal growth factor-induced formation of clathrin-coated pits correlates with retention of epidermal growth factor receptor-ErbB2 oligomeric complexes at the plasma membrane.
PPAR-delta also regulates glucose metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis by inducing FOXO1 and PGC1-alpha.
Nischarin, a cytosolic protein that binds the alpha5beta1 integrin, plays an important role in fibroblast migration, and in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.
We report here that MIG-2, a widely expressed focal adhesion protein, interacts with beta1 and beta3 integrin cytoplasmic domains.
TGF beta/Smad signaling system and its pathologic correlates.
Glioma cell sensitivity to CD95-mediated apoptosis is regulated by CD95 expression at the cell surface and by the levels of intracellular apoptosis-regulatory proteins, including bcl-2 family members.
