The PITSLRE/CDK11p58 protein kinase promotes centrosome maturation and bipolar spindle formation.
We review the humanized epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the major EGFR target drugs in HGG treatments, focusing on the EGFR antibody nimotuzumab as a new therapeutic strategy in HGG.
Polyomavirus enhancer binding protein (PEBP)2beta(core binding factor [CBF]beta), a heterodimerizing partner of AML1 that is located mainly in the cytoplasm, was translocated into the nucleus with dependence on the runt domain of AML1/ETO(MTG8) or AML1/Evi-1 when coexpressed with these chimeric proteins.
The gap junction protein, connexin 36 (Cx36), was up-regulated in MIN6 cell aggregates and RhoA/ROCK-inactivated monolayer cells.
Using protein cross-linking followed by affinity purification, we detected the lipid raft-associated proteins flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 and the ESCRT-associated proteins ALIX and syntenin-1 in membrane-localized MLKL immunoprecipitates.
A mutation in PNPT1, encoding mitochondrial-RNA-import protein PNPase, causes hereditary hearing loss.
The expression of LOX-1 and matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) were studied after incubating nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) with ox-LDL.
Mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of EGF receptor affect EGF binding and receptor internalization.
However, neither TIMP-2 nor TIMP-3 proteins seemed to accumulate in the nuclei of Gin-1 cells.
Phosphorylation levels of protein kinase B (Akt), extracellular signal-regulated kinase and cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein were evaluated by Western blot.
We identified nucleolin, a multifunctional major nucleolar protein, as a novel NS1-binding protein.
alpha1beta1 integrin is a potential collagen-binding extracellular matrix receptor that mediates collagen-dependent cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and collagen matrix assembly and thereby may participate in the wound healing and pathologic scarring observed in some damaged organs.
DHPG increased TRPC4 and TRPC5 in the cytoplasmic compartment and decreased these proteins in the plasma membrane.
Here, we identify two ER membrane proteins, SPFH2 and TMUB1, as associated proteins of mammalian gp78, a membrane-bound ubiquitin ligase that bears significant sequence homology with mammalian Hrd1 and mediates sterol-accelerated ERAD of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme HMG-CoA reductase.
Clone ANX1-S showed higher constitutive (more than 2 fold) and activated caspase-3 activity, associated with higher phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity (in the region of +50 - 100%), whereas expression of cytosolic PLA2 Bax and Bcl-2 were similar in all cell clones, as determined by Western blotting.
Two novel regulatory mechanisms of LDL receptor (LDLR) intracellular trafficking have been described.
Using the proteomics data and bioinformatics results, the top seven biomarker candidates were coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain-containing protein 2, mitochondrial (CHCHD2), succinyl-CoA ligase [GDP-forming] subunit beta, mitochondrial (SUCLG2), stomatin-like protein 2, mitochondrial (STOML2), ES1 protein homolog, mitochondrial (C21orf33), fumarate hydratase, mitochondrial (FH), 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase type-2 (HSD17B10), and electron transfer flavoprotein subunit beta (ETFB); and the top seven therapeutic target candidates were insulin receptor (INSR), Myc proto-oncogene protein (MYC), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PPARGC1A), gastrin (GAST), N-myc proto-oncogene protein (MYCN), transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFB1), and interleukin-4 (IL4).
This data indicates that Zo-1 is a response protein to inner medullary tonicity and that extracellular stressors can promote Zo-1 protein expression, tyrosine phosphorylation and cytoskeleton association.
Thus, our data delineate a novel integrin activation pathway in which ligand binding to GPIb-IX activates PKG that stimulates MAPK pathway, leading to integrin activation.
In addition, we observed that in response to gastrin, beta1-integrin is tyrosine phosphorylated by Src family kinases and associates with paxillin, a scaffold protein involved in focal adhesion and integrin signalling.
