Recognition of UbcH5c and the nucleosome by the Bmi1/Ring1b ubiquitin ligase complex.
Mechanistically, we show that CKII phosphorylation of Spt6 promotes the interaction of Spt6 with Spn1, a binding partner required for chromatin reassembly and full recruitment of Spt6 to genes.
The kinases MEK-1, MEK-2, ERK-1/MAPK and ERK-2/MAPK are activated by phosphorylation at specific sites, and these events can be monitored using phospho-specific antibodies.
Under uninfected conditions, NSCs expressed TLR3 and phosphorylated IRF3, but after infection, the expression level of TLR3 was upregulated and the phosphorylation level of IRF3 in the nucleus was significantly enhanced, while IFN-β was also expressed.
Accordingly, T1 IFN-inducible Absent in Melanoma 2 proteins (murine Aim2 and human AIM2) negatively regulate the expression of TI IFNs and, upon sensing higher levels of cytosolic DNA, assemble the Aim2/AIM2 inflammasome, resulting in activation of caspase-1, pyroptosis, and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β and IL-18).
A comparison of our data with reported methylome changes in cells infected with M. tuberculosis revealed commonality of differentially methylated genes, including genes involved in T cell responses (BCL11B, FOXO1, KIF13B, PAWR, SOX4, SYK), actin cytoskeleton organisation (ACTR3, CDC42BPA, DTNBP1, FERMT2, PRKCZ, RAC1), and cytokine production (FOXP1, IRF8, MR1).
Osteopontin is a glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix, and Pokémon is a regulator of transcription.
Nitration/S-nitrosation were formed in the following treated proteins, including bovine serum albumin (BSA), DNase-1, ceruloplasmin, catalase and hemoglobin (Hb).
The RhoA-binding protein, rhophilin-2, regulates actin cytoskeleton organization.
Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that competitively inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).
Like insulin, bafilomycin A1 induced the redistribution of GLUT1 and Rab4, but not that of other proteins whose membrane localization has been shown to be insulin-insensitive.
Cytologic localization of epidermal growth factor receptor and myc oncogene protein product in developing human placenta was analyzed by avidin/biotin immunoperoxidase techniques with a monoclonal antibody to epidermal growth factor receptor and an affinity purified polyclonal antibody to myc protein product.
In addition, inhibition of threonine-187 phosphorylation of p27(kip1) protein for ubiquitinyl-proteasomal mediated degradation was also involved in upregulation of p27(kip1).
Katanin is a microtubule-severing protein comprised of an AAA ATPase subunit and an accessory subunit designated as p60 and p80, respectively.
TGF-beta receptors were functional in T98G glioblastoma cells leading to SMAD3/SMAD4 nuclear translocation and activation of SMAD-dependent promoter.
The potential connections between intracellular signalling pathways triggered by GLP-1 stimulation were performed before incubating cells with kinase pharmacological inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)1/2, phosphatydilinositol-3kinase (PI3K), or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).
TJ proteins identified include transmembrane proteins; occludin and claudin, and cytoplasmic plaque proteins; ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3, cingulin, and 7H6.
Large increases were induced in the three major mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways: p38 MAP kinase, extracellular regulated protein-serine kinase (ERK)1/2 and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK).
We describe a novel signaling pathway that couples the αvβ6 integrin cell surface receptor to androgen receptor via activation of JNK1 and causes increased nuclear localization and activity of androgen receptor.
12.1%) were those in which liver GST-D activities were less than 10 nmol/min per mg cytosolic protein, "low GST dogs", and the other dogs were classified as "middle" and "high" GST dogs for which the liver GST-D activities were 10-80 and >80 nmol/min per mg protein, respectively, and occurred at similar percentages (41.4% for the middle GST dog and 46.4% for the high GST dog).
