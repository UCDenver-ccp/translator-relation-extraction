The clinical utility of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is widely recognised.
Investigation via cytology and colposcopy have lower sensitivity than HPV testing in the diagnosis of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+).
In order to represent the human disease more accurately, which is caused by heterozygous NR2F1 mutations, we investigated a heterozygous knockout mouse model, and found that this model recapitulates some of the neurological phenotypes of BBSOAS, including altered learning/memory, hearing defects, neonatal hypotonia, and decreased hippocampal volume.
Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a humanized anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor monoclonal antibody that is widely used to treat rheumatic arthritis (RA).
The Psf3 expression was an independent prognostic factor and could be a biomarker of adjuvant tegafur-uracil for stage I pulmonary adenocarcinoma.
We have shown in previous studies that high Psf3 expression was a poor prognostic marker for pulmonary adenocarcinoma.
All rats survived until sacrifice on post-operative day (POD) 1, 3, and 7. HE-staining showed normal at POD1, mild periportal edema, and slight bile duct and venous endothelial inflammation at POD3, and moderate acute cellular rejection at POD7 without parenchymal necrosis.
The Jumonji domain-containing protein D3 (JMJD3), specifically demethylate di- and trimethyl-lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me2/3), has been widely studied in immune diseases, infectious diseases, cancer, developmental diseases, and aging related diseases.
Consistent with these findings, short hairpin RNA targeting SPRY4‑IT1 also hindered xenograft tumour growth and altered the levels of miR‑101, ZEB1/2 and E‑cadherin in vivo.
Among these 13 hub-genes, a four-gene signature including neutrophil cytosol factor 2 (NCF2, P = .025), myosin-If (MYO1F, P = .001), sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 4 (S1PR4, P = .015), and ficolin-1 (FCN1, P = .012) alone or combined with two risk factors (male sex and hyperlipidemia) may represent potential diagnostic biomarkers in obstructive CAD.
Pregnant women with GDM had decreased mRNA expression of IGF-1, IGF-1R and IGF-2R and IGFBP-4 in VAT and IGF-1R in SAT compared to pregnant women without GDM.
Sestrin2 is involved in asthma: a case-control study.
Remarkably, DOK6 promoter methylation could serve as an independent and integrated prognostic biomarker not only in non-APL AML patients but also in AML patients who are less than 60 years old.
Herein, we verified the promoter methylation status of DOK6 and further explored its clinical implication in de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Usefulness of Bcl-2 Expression and the Expression of Cytoplasmic Immunoglobulin Light Chains in the Differentiation Between B-Cell Lymphoma and Reactive Lymphocytic Proliferations in FNA.
These infiltrating macrophages secrete SPP1, which sustains glioma cell survival and stimulates angiogenesis.
To compare the degree of cellular senescence among COPD, IPF, and CTD-ILD, tissue samples from surgical lung biopsies or noncancerous tissue from lobectomy specimens of patients with lung cancer were subjected to immunostaining for p16 and p21.
CASC9 expression discriminated tumors from normal tissues with even higher specificity than HOTAIR, a lncRNA previously suggested as an HNSCC biomarker.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate DPP4 as a potential target for the treatment of fibrosis in systemic sclerosis (SSc).
NAFLD is commonly seen in individuals with metabolic abnormalities, such as obesity and insulin resistance, which are closely associated with sarcopenia.
