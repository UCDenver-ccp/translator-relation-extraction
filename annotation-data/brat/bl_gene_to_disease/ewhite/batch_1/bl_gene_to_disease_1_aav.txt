The underlying CAD was due to atherosclerosis in 52/79 (65.8%), spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) in 11/79 (13.9%), coronary artery spasm in 7/79 (8.9%) and thrombus in 9/79 (11.4%).There were six adverse cardiac events (6.6% event rate), one non-ST elevation myocardial infarction at 23 weeks' gestation, two SCAD recurrences (one at 26 weeks' gestation and one at 9 weeks' postpartum), one symptomatic deterioration in left ventricular function and two women with worsening angina.
Angio-associated migratory cell protein interacts with epidermal growth factor receptor and enhances proliferation and drug resistance in human non-small cell lung cancer cells.
The Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein Inhibitor, des-Fluoro-Anacetrapib, Prevents Vein Bypass-induced Neointimal Hyperplasia in New Zealand White Rabbits.
In addition, intravenous administration of PAMPSF/p53/RG inhibited tumor growth of MDA-MB-435 and MCF-7/WT xenograft mice models.
Because the effect of ipragliflozin against breast cancer cells was completely canceled by knocking down SGLT2, ipragliflozin could act via inhibiting SGLT2.
The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of XRCC6 C1310G and LIG4 T9I genes polymorphisms on colorectal cancer risk among Polish population.
Furthermore, the expression of EZH2 was increased in tumors with a higher TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors stage and histological grade compared with tumors with a lower stage and grade.
High glucose promotes prostate cancer cells apoptosis via Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway.
Disabled-2 (Dab2) is a multifunctional scaffold protein frequently downregulated in cancer that has been linked to the process of EMT.
Upregulated MFAP5 is a common feature in aggressive ICC patients' tissues.
Western blot was conducted to detect the expression of p53 after the knockdown of SNHG7 in osteosarcoma cells.
Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a well-known to be involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease and harbors several phosphorylation sites in its cytoplasmic domain.
Luminal tumors showed decreased activity in the nodes of epidermis development and extracellular matrix, and increased activity in the node of steroid metabolism leading to a higher expression of the androgen receptor.
Biological behaviors of glioma cells were detected, circ-PTPRZ1 enhanced cell proliferation and invasion, and inhibited cell apoptosis; miR-1261 had the opposite effects, and could terminate the above effects of circ-PTPRZ1.
This study aims to examine the association between early gestational maternal C-reactive protein (CRP), prospectively assayed in stored maternal sera and the risk of ADHD in offspring.
Expressional differences were clearly shown between embryonic, cancer and somatic cells that mESCs displayed higher expressional level of Atg10, Hdac1 and Cln3 which are related with autophagic regulation and Hsp4, Prkca, Rhoa and ribosomal S6 genes related with mTOR activity.
Combination strategies of VEGF and MET inhibitors could lead to sustained and deep responses even in non-MET driven RCC by inhibiting pathways of VEGF resistance.
For patients with locally advanced or metastasized SCCs treatment with cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has been proposed and so far, treatment of five DEB patients with cetuximab has been published.
Overproduction of Th1- and Th17-cytokines including interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-23, IL-17, and IL-22, is a major driver of the disease.
Finally, training-evoked increase of the BDNF/TrkB leads to a change in a manner of regulation of skeletal muscles, causes a reduction of motor deficits observed in the Parkinson disease, and lowers weight, glucose level, and blood pressure, which accompany the MetS.
