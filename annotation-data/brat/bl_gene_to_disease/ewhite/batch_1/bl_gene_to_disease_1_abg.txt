Adiponectin for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.
Thirty-six patients (17 from cohort 1 and 19 from cohort 2) with myositis and cancer were anti-TIF1-γ antibody positive; all had DM.
Biochemical and biophysical characterizations of three nonsense mutations of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) associated with a severe form of cystic fibrosis (CF) reveal the importance and heterogenous effects of the position of the premature termination codon (PTC) on the CFTR protein function.
Mowat-Wilson syndrome: Generation of two human iPS cell lines (UUIGPi004A and UUIGPi005A) from siblings with a truncating ZEB2 gene variant.
Nodal positive lung adenocarcinoma includes wide range of survival.
We sought to determine if dietary omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3 FAs) delay the development and progression of CRPC and inhibit tumor-associated M2-like macrophages.
Many authors in their work prove that work in a rotational rotation system affects the occurrence of various types of cancer, hormone production, occurrence of metabolic disorders and civilization diseases (type II diabetes, insulin resistance, overweight and obesity, hypertension and coronary heart disease), microflora differentiation intestinal and contributes to increased stress of the body.
Feedback loop in miR-449b-3p/ADAM17/NF-κB promotes metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
However, inactivation of PDE3A or knocking-down its gene expression did not inhibit cancer cell growth.
Strikingly, we find that inflammatory cytokine blockade using the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist anakinra leads to an attenuation of inflammatory arthritis and myeloid expansion in the bone marrow of arthritic mice.
Overexpression of PRL-3, an oncogenic phosphatase, was identified as a novel cluster in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-17 (IL-17), and interferon-γ (IFN), amplify blood pressure elevation and/or renal injury.
Coagulation system activation, a conspicuous feature of SCD that causes chronic inflammation, is an important component of SCD pathophysiology.
Two probands carried bi-allelic LRP5 variants, both presenting with bilateral retinal folds.
In this study, we evaluated the functional role of IL22 in chronic colitis and probed mechanisms of IL22-mediated regulation of colonic epithelial cells.
Transplantation of PDK2/4-deficient bone marrow into irradiated wild-type mice to produce mice with PDK2/4-deficient myeloid cells prevented M1 polarization, reduced obesity-associated insulin resistance, and ameliorated adipose tissue inflammation.
This study aimed to investigate the plasma long noncoding RNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (lncRNA MALAT1) expression with risk, severity, inflammation level, and prognosis in sepsis.
From an initial base of 297 patients with CKD and hypovitaminosis D, those with normal or high levels of PTH were chosen for therapy with native vitamin D. The initial administered dose was 1000 IU/day, with adjustments every 4 months of 1000 IU (maximum 4000 IU/day, according to RDA and IOM), until achieving serum levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D greater than 30 ng/mL and lower than 80 ng/mL.
Intramuscular fast-flow vascular anomaly contains somatic MAP2K1 and KRAS mutations.
PTB-AS, a Novel Natural Antisense Transcript, Promotes Glioma Progression by Improving PTBP1 mRNA Stability with SND1.
