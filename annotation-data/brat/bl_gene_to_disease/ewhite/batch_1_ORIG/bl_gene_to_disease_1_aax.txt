Long Non-coding RNA LINC00628 Interacts Epigenetically with the LAMA3 Promoter and Contributes to Lung Adenocarcinoma.
Altogether, our results provide evidence of a mechanism by which LINC00628 silencing exerts an inhibitory role in lung adenocarcinoma by modulating the DNA methylation of LAMA3, indicative of a novel molecular target for treatment of lung adenocarcinoma patients showing resistance to VCR.
FGFR3 antibodies have been associated with sensory neuropathy, but many questions remain regarding their use in clinical practice.
Decreased HDAC8 expression in ICC is related to poor prognosis, and HDAC8 may be an independent prognostic indicator of ICC patients after curative resection.
Enrichment of CD103+ tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) is associated with improved outcomes in patients.
The tumor suppressive ability of miR‑195 in rectal cancer cell proliferation and metastasis was mediated by blocking IGF1 expression and inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway.
New onset IBD has been reported with the use of anti-IL-17 agents, but it remains unclear to what extent this is attributed to treatment or to underlying disease.
New onset IBD with the use of anti-IL-17 agents was rare.
There was no difference in the risk of developing new onset IBD with anti-IL-17 agents compared to placebo (MH RD 0.00062, 95% CI -0.00072-0.0021,
To evaluate the risk of new onset IBD with the use of anti-IL-17 agents METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCT) of anti-IL-17 agents (brodalumab, ixekizumab and secukinumab).
These findings highlight the importance of ADAM15 Intra Cellular Domain-mediated interactions in regulating substrate selection and breast cancer cell phenotype.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by triglyceride accumulation in the hepatocytes in the absence of alcohol overconsumption, commonly associated with insulin resistance and obesity.
Integrated analysis of transcriptome data revealed MMP3 and MMP13 as critical genes in anaplastic thyroid cancer progression.
Downregulating SynCAM and MPP6 expression is associated with ovarian cancer progression.
In addition, low levels of MPP6 in ovarian tumor tissues correlated with shorter patient survival.
NBAT1 functioned as an endogenous sponge by competing for miR-346 binding to GSK-3β and therefore alleviated RCC cells.
LncRNA NBAT1 suppresses cell proliferation and migration via miR-346/GSK-3β axis in renal carcinoma.
Compared to scramble group, CASC2 overexpression significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis of cervical cancer cells.
The expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2), B-cell lymphoma-2 associated X (BAX), Ezrin, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), lung resistance-related protein (LRP), multiple drug resistance protein 1 (MRP1), glutathione-S-transferase-π (GST-π), and P glycoprotein (P-gp) protein was determined by Western blotting.
AH in neonatal pigs is associated with early lung injury, inflammation and alterations of tight junctions (Claudin, Occludin, JAM-1) and gap junctions (Connexin 43) in lung tissue, which contributes to the development of lung edema and impaired function.
