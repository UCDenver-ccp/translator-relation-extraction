Immunohistochemistry revealed that shikonin potently suppresses the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway in local skin lesions and increases CEBPD expression.
However, shikonin can reverse these effects, suggesting that CEBPD may be a potential therapeutic target for psoriasis.
AM inoculation increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), and soluble sugar content in leaves.
Remarkably, an siRNA-mediated reduction of HP1α in NBS fibroblasts decreases the hypersensitivity to irradiation, a characteristic of the NBS syndrome.
The aim of this study was to investigate the association of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within Toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4) gene and additional gene- environment interaction with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) risk.
In RSM from patients with IBS-D (but not IBS-C), mRNA expression of AQP3 was decreased, and AQP7 and 8 were increased relative to controls.
CD8 + and forkhead box protein P3 + (FoxP3 +) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) influence the tumor microenvironment, but the clinical significance of CD8 + and FoxP3 + TILs in stage IA lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) is poorly understood.
BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the expression of CD35 and CD64 from white blood cells (neutrophil, monocytes, and lymphocytes) and acute infectious diseases in children.
Transmembrane-4 L-six family member-1 (TM4SF1) promotes non-small cell lung cancer proliferation, invasion and chemo-resistance through regulating the DDR1/Akt/ERK-mTOR axis.
Prolactin activates IRF1 and leads to altered balance of histone acetylation: Implications for systemic lupus erythematosus.
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a serious non-atherosclerotic disease, most frequently presenting as an acute coronary syndrome and affecting female patients.
Anti-transcriptional intermediary factor 1-γ antibody as a biomarker in patients with dermatomyositis.
The plasma testosterone level, the activity of HO and myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzymes; the concentrations of the HO-1, tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-α), and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), as well as the total level of glutathione (GSH + GSSG) were determined from the cardiac left ventricle.
In the hippocampus of LPS group interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, nitric oxide metabolites, and malondialdehyde were higher while thiol, BDNF, and IL-10 concentrations and the activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were lower than the control group.
Univariate and multivariate analyses using Cox proportional hazards model were performed to identify associations between immunohistochemical staining of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1α), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), osteopontin (OPN) and microvessel density (MVD) using CD-34 antibody with clinical outcome.
The contents of nitric oxide( NO),superoxide dismutase( SOD),malondialdehyde( MDA),reduced glutathione( GSHPX),interleukin( IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor( TNF-α) in liver tissues were detected by kit assay.
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), an autosomal recessive, autoinflammatory disease that is common in Arabs, Jews, Armenians and Turks, is caused by mutations in the MEFV gene, which encodes a protein called pyrin.
Insulinomas are neuroendocrine tumors characterized by an excessive secretion of insulin, and its most common primary site is the pancreas.
In this Review, we provide the latest insights into the complexity and interplay of the components of the non-canonical renin-angiotensin system, and discuss the function and therapeutic potential of targeting this system to treat cardiovascular disease.
Counter-regulatory renin-angiotensin system in cardiovascular disease.
