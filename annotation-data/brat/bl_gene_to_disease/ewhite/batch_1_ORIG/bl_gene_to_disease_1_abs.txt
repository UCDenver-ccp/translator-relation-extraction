ALPK1 hotspot mutation as a driver of human spiradenoma and spiradenocarcinoma.
All the treated groups showed a significant therapeutic improvement in arthritis proved by measuring rats knee diameter as well as the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).
Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a life-threatening, progressive, infiltrative disease caused by the deposition of transthyretin amyloid fibrils in the heart, and can often be overlooked as a common cause of heart failure.
It has been shown that signal transducers and activator of transcription (STAT) contributes to the progression of cancer cells.
The compounds bind directly to FOXM1 and alter its proteolytic sensitivity, reduce the cellular level of FOXM1 protein by a proteasome- dependent process, and suppress breast cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and increase apoptosis.
We have previously shown that STAT3 is activated (phosphorylated) at high levels in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) T cells and mediates chemokine-induced migration and T:B cell interactions.
Taken together, our results suggest that in mouse models of autoimmune nephritis, T cell-specific silencing of STAT3 can hamper their ability to help B cells to produce autoantibodies and induce cell tissue infiltration.
ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion was detected in 5 cases, whereas, in the remaining tumor, a novel NFIX-PKN1 gene fusion was found.
Knockdown of human telomerase reverse transcriptase induces apoptosis in cervical cancer cell line.
The blood concentrations of melatonin, proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrotizing factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1-β (IL-1-β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-4 (IL-4), and interleukin-10 (IL-10), were studied.
The probability of TRM was higher in SCID patients (p=0.02) and in patients receiving >5×10⁶/kg CD34+ cells (p=0.0001).
Previous studies have reported that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 39 (USP39) is generally overexpressed in a variety of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer and so forth.
The continuous metabolic syndrome score (cMetS) was calculated by using the sum of the Z scores of the following indicators: body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, glucose, total cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c and LDL-c) and triglycerides.
Our study proposed that dietary AP could be explored as a new dietary strategy to combat obesity and related insulin resistance.
By KEGG analysis, four key enriched pathways were obtained, including the 'MAPK signaling pathway', the 'Ras signaling pathway', 'prostate cancer', and the 'FoxO signaling pathway'.
Additionally, membranous CLDN6 immunoreactivity detected in intestinal type GC tumors was correlated with worse overall survival.
 through mitochondria-mediated PCD, and thedeletion of Pep4 gene possibly accelerated the effect of PCD.
The RNA polymerase III repressor MAF1 is regulated by ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation and modulates cancer drug resistance and apoptosis.
MAF1 homolog, negative regulator of RNA polymerase III (MAF1) is a key repressor of RNA polymerase (pol) III-dependent transcription and functions as a tumor suppressor.
MEG3-derived miR-493-5p overcomes the oncogenic feature of IGF2-miR-483 loss of imprinting in hepatic cancer cells.
