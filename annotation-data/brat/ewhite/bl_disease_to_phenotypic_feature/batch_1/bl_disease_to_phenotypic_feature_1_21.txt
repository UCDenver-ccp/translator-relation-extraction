Influence of etiology of heart failure on the obesity paradox.
Here we report on a 5-year-old girl who presented with global developmental delay, seizures, callosal agenesis, cataracts, sensorineural hearing loss, hypopigmentation, and immunodeficiency with a low CD4 count and recurrent infections.
Vasodepressor syncope, orthostatic hypotension, acute adrenal insufficiency, hyperventilation, asthma, heart failure and acute pulmonary edema, cerebrovascular accident seizures, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and anaphylaxis will be emphasized.
Varicella pneumonia with shock and heart failure.
Gitelman's syndrome (familial hypokalemia-hypomagnesemia).
Under these circumstances, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia are evident.
The mechanisms involved in cataract formation, including those of hypoglycemic cataract and osmotic cataracts, are discussed.
Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is a global cause of preventable hearing impairment, blindness, and intellectual impairment.
It is not associated with dementia, seizures, rigidity, or ataxia.
Spina bifida, club foot, exencephaly and anal atresia were also observed frequently.
Senior-Loken syndrome associated with mental retardation and microcephaly.
Asthma after childhood pneumonia.
Neurological abnormalities occurring as a part of a MID include stroke-like episodes, epilepsy, migraine-like headache, movement disorders, cerebellar ataxia, visual impairment, encephalopathy, cognitive impairment, dementia, psychosis, hypopituitarism, aneurysms, or peripheral nervous system disease, such as myopathy, neuropathy, or neuronopathy.
Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide.
Myocardial metabolism abnormalities may contribute to the development of obesity-related heart failure.
The presence of VM in glioblastoma was not associated with gender, age, Karnofsky performance status, hydrocephalus, tumor burden, microvessel density, tumor relapse, or the extent of tumor resection.
We report a sporadic case of periodic ataxia characterized by recurrent attacks of vertigo and ataxia.
These reactions included nausea/vomiting, fever, visual impairment, and peripheral neuritis.
Recurrent clinical features in these patients include mental retardation/intellectual disability, autism, seizure, dysmorphic feature or multiple congenital anomalies.
The clinical manifestations are varied and include cranial neuropathy, aseptic meningitis, hydrocephalus, headache, seizure, neuropsychiatric symptoms, neuroendocrine dysfunction, myelopathy, and peripheral neuropathy.
