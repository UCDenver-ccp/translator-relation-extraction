Klippel-Feil syndrome with unilateral renal agenesis and renal failure.
Hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia was noted in four cases.
The most frequent polycombinations were hyperglycemia-hypercholesterolemia-hypertriglyceridemia (13.2%) and hyperglycemia-hypertriglyceridemia-hypercholesterolemia-hypertension (10.5%).
In patients on dialysis, hypoparathyroidism may lead to hypophosphatemia.
Epithelial keratitis is a common complication after cataract surgery.
At low salinity, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypocalcemia were observed.
glucocorticoid-reversible hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinaemia and hypercalcaemia.
Ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and cleft palate (EEC) syndrome.
and those of cataract blindness by BCVA<0.10 and cataract blindness by presenting visual acuity (PVA)<0.10 were 2.56% (95% CI?=?1.94-3.38)
Noonan syndrome (NS) is characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphisms and congenital heart defects.
A second patient with Tsukahara syndrome: type A1 brachydactyly, short stature, hearing loss, microcephaly, mental retardation and ptosis.
Penile edema and renal failure.
The ocular abnormalities include ptosis, microphthalmia and hypertelorism.
Neurological examination revealed a mild truncal ataxia and ataxic dysarthria.
Most frequent defects were heart defects, followed by cleft lip and palate, abdominal wall defects, skeletal dysplasia, hydrocephalus, polydactyly and Down syndrome.
X-linked neurodegenerative syndrome with congenital ataxia, late-onset progressive myoclonic encephalopathy and selective macular degeneration, linked to Xp22.33-pter.
Gradual painless visual loss: glaucoma.
Single cases each of anophthalmos, Beh?et's disease, Hallerman-Streiff syndrome, hydrocephalus, macular degeneration and optic atrophy were recorded.
