The expression of functional RAD6B variants only in melanomas reveals RAD6B's molecular heterogeneity and its association with melanoma pathogenesis.
Plasma BDNF levels are elevated and increase over time in children with SCD.
In this study, firstly the differential expression of Ski in OS tissues and osteochondroma tissues was detected, and the expression of Ski in both human OS cell lines (MG63 and U2OS) and normal osteoblasts (hFoB1.19)
CDK7 inhibitor THZ1 inhibits MCL1 synthesis and drives cholangiocarcinoma apoptosis in combination with BCL2/BCL-XL inhibitor ABT-263.
B7-H3 belongs to the B7 family of immune checkpoint proteins, which are important regulators of the adaptive immune response and emerging key players in human cancer.
Here, we review the current knowledge on the involvement of B7-H3 in human cancer.
Abdominal and Chest X-rays were unremarkable, blood tests showed worsening Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) on Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD); and raised C-Reactive Protein (CRP) with no obvious symptoms or focus of infection.
We also noted that EGFR-expressing tumor discs have abnormally extensive tracheation (respiratory tubes) and ectopically express Branchless (Bnl, a FGF) and FGFR.
Bnl is a known inducer of tracheation that signals by a cytoneme-mediated process in other contexts, and we determined that exogenous over-expression of dominant negative FGFR suppressed tumor growth.
Therefore, Sirt1 might be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of left ventricular remodeling caused by CKD.
Loss of ARID1A induces a stemness gene ALDH1A1 expression with histone acetylation in the malignant subtype of cholangiocarcinoma.
These results suggest that NRN1 may be a biomarker response to the effect of GnRHa treatment for patients with ovarian endometriosis.
ApoE4 constitutes the most important genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas ApoE2 protects against AD.
The expression of CASC15 and β-catenin was upregulated in melanoma tissues and cells.
Correlations between PHQ-9 and TNSr score were found only in Met-BDNF carriers, suggesting that peripheral neuropathy and depression coincide in Met-BDNF carriers.
Overexpression of ASPM, CDC20, and TTK Confer a Poorer Prognosis in Breast Cancer Identified by Gene Co-expression Network Analysis.
Metformin did not significantly change serum insulin and HDL-C levels, and hepatic SOD activity; however, serum levels of TC, TG, and LDL-C, as well as hepatic MDA levels, thiol content and CAT activity were improved compared to diabetic (p<0.05-p<0.001).
Foveal hypoplasia was observed in all subjects with ATF6 mutations.
Melanin is synthesized through a series of oxidative reactions initiated with tyrosine and catalyzed by melanogenesis-related proteins such as tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1), dopachrome tautomerase (TRP-2), and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF).
In this study, in vitro and in vivo data suggested that CRM197 treatment sensitized paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel, at least in part, via nucleus accumbens-1 (NAC-1) and its downstream pathway, DNA damage-inducible 45-γ interacting protein (Gadd45gip1)/growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 (Gadd45), in A2780/Taxol and SKOV3/Taxol cells.
