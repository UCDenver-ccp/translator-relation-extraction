Our findings suggest that visfatin and IL-6 levels in GCF are associated with the pathogenesis of obesity and periodontitis.
In the present study, the expression of MTMR3 in breast cancer was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissues from 172 patients.
SOX11: friend or foe in tumor prevention and carcinogenesis?
However, there are currently no effective STAT3 inhibitors in clinical practice for the treatment of colorectal cancer.
Mutations of NLRP12 were detected by primary immunodeficiency disease panels and further examined by Sanger sequencing.
Here, we demonstrate that GATA3 reduces the ATP level in the breast cancer microenvironment and inhibits breast cancer metastasis by up-regulating ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 3 (ENTPD3).
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) electrochemical immunosensor has been developed for rapid detection of urokinase type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) - a biomarker for cancer.
Air occlusion in insulin pumps of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
In conclusion, the Saudi overweight and obese population seems to be at risk of low AMY1, which correlates with their obesity.
Recent studies demonstrate that peripheral amylin treatment reduces pathology in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Increased understanding of the role of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex 2 (NOX2)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will likely reveal novel targets for therapeutic intervention.
Several reports have shown that the anticancer effect of coumarins and their derivatives are mediated through targeting angiogenesis by modulating the functions of vascular endothelial growth factor as well as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, which are involved in cancer pathogenesis.
Three members of ABC transporters superfamily, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and ABCB5 were investigated, whose overexpression in tumors is tightly linked to multidrug resistance.
Although loss of function mutations in the ubiquitin ligase, parkin, cause autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease, there is evidence that parkin is inactivated in sporadic Parkinson's disease.
In conclusion, treatment with GW788388 prevented cancer cachexia, and downregulated associated ubiquitin ligase Atrogin-1.
Of 35 PAX8 cases, 23 (66%) showed only weak expression in 1% to 10% cells, 8 (23%) were weakly (5/8) or moderately (3/8) PAX8 in 11% to 50% cells, and 4 (11%) showed weak PAX8 positivity in >50% tumor cells.
In this study, we examined the combined treatment of CAP and SN on G-361 human melanoma cells by evaluating cellular toxicity levels, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) levels, DNA damage, melanoma-specific markers, apoptosis, caspases and poly ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) levels using flow cytometer.
Although bacillus Calmette-Guérin cell wall skeleton (BCG-CWS) might function as a potential substitute for live BCG, its use in the treatment of bladder cancer remains limited owing to issues such as insolubility and micrometer-size following exposure to an aqueous environment.
Moreover, the downstream locus was also screened and small mothers against decapentaplegic 7 (Smad7) was revealed to be a direct target of miR-106a, with its 3'-UTR region complementarily bound to miR-106a and the protein expression was mediated by miR-106a in gastric cancer cells, which was confirmed by luciferase assay and Western blot.
We previously identified Homo sapiens PGM5 antisense RNA 1 (PGM5-AS1) as a novel esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)-related lncRNA by performing high-throughput RNA sequencing.
