Overall, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the tumor immune surveillance state in response to radiotherapy and suggest a therapeutic synergy between radiotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. -- PMID:31467431
Then, eight typical lncRNAs were selected for validation of expression levels by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and were detected in EBV-positive or EBV-negative GC and NPC cells. -- PMID:31199512
Moreover, absence of intestinal epithelial Hif1-α markedly changed the population of IELs in NSAID-induced small intestinal injury and increased susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. -- PMID:31040849
In this study, a new imidazolidine derivative 3-(2-chloro-6-fluorobenzyl)-imidazolidine-2,4-dione, PT-31, a putative α2A-adrenoceptor agonist, was evaluated in mouse models predictive of efficacy in the treatment of positive and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, as well as its ability to promote cerebellar granule cell survival in vitro, in the presence or absence of glutamate (100 µmol/l). -- PMID:31206371
Dehydrochlorination occurred, and HCl, benzene and toluene were detected during the pyrolysis of capacitor scarfskin. -- PMID:31450210
strains with reduced fidaxomicin susceptibilities causing CDI in Japan; however, mutant strains with reduced fidaxomicin susceptibilities were detected after fidaxomicin treatment. -- PMID:31527041
Vitiligo is an acquired pigmentation disorder characterized by melanocyte loss via autoimmune mechanisms triggered by oxidative stress. -- PMID:31120146
We discuss this rare case of infantile idiopathic intracranial hypertension and provide a review of the literature, including an overview of disease characteristics and outcomes of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in this very young age group. -- PMID:31309848
To optimize and validate a current (NRG [a newly constituted National Clinical Trials Network group through National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project [NSABP], the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group [RTOG] and the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)]) nomogram for glioblastoma patients as part of continuous validation. -- PMID:31489457
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly used for molecular diagnosis and epidemiology of infectious diseases. -- PMID:31830038
Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), weight, number of days fasted, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia episodes, and emergency hospital visits were collected and analyzed after completing the month. -- PMID:31318694
Hence, to retain the balance between health beneficial phenolics and sensory attributes, optimization of roasting condition specific to the cultivar type substantially required. -- PMID:31432017
RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data associated with colon adenocarcinoma were retrieved from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). -- PMID:31496744
L-cysteine/hydrogen sulfide pathway induces cGMP-dependent relaxation of corpus cavernosum and penile arteries from patients with erectile dysfunction and improves arterial vasodilation induced by PDE5 inhibition. -- PMID:31542487
The AIM-2-like receptors for DNA, interferon-γ-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) and Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) were candidate PRRs. -- PMID:31333597
Alloimmunization of a dog erythrocyte antigen 1- dog transfused with weakly dog erythrocyte antigen 1+ blood. -- PMID:31361062
The group with diabetes had a significantly decreased rate of mitochondrial respiration fueled by palmitoyl-carnitine that correlated with blood glucose dysregulation, while there was no difference in oxidation of pyruvate. -- PMID:31391173
Although the laryngoscope handle has been considered a noncritical item that contacts only intact skin, health care team members should consider both the laryngoscope blade and handle as semicritical items and process them by high-level disinfection (HLD) or steam sterilization according to manufacturer's instructions. -- PMID:31246299
In metabolic disorders associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLDs), lower circulating glycine levels have been consistently observed, and clinical studies suggest the existence of beneficial effects induced by glycine supplementation. -- PMID:31208147
This study evaluated both theories in children diagnosed with ASD (n = 16) and a group of TD children (n = 20) using eye tracking and demonstrated that distractor type only impacted the proportion of dwell time on faces in the TD group, but not the ASD group. -- PMID:31811617
