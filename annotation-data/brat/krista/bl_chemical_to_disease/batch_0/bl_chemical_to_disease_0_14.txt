The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of genetically determined iron status on carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaque, and venous thromboembolism using Mendelian randomization. -- PMID:31310728
ERBB2 and KRAS inhibition cooperates to suppress PDAC cell growth in vitro and to promote tumor regression in nude mice, providing a rationale for testing an anti-ERBB2 drug in combination with a KRAS inhibitor in ERBB2-mutant PDAC patients that are currently untreatable. -- PMID:31046123
Iatrogenic immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) are a group of lymphoid proliferations or lymphomas that are well known to be associated with an immunosuppressed state. -- PMID:31314679
Continued efforts with new intraperitoneal chemotherapy agents and methods of drug delivery continue for ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, and gastric cancer. -- PMID:31725340
Antigen-antibody binding and target cells with high growth rate were two integral prerequisites for exerting anti-tumor activity of HcHAb18-DM1. -- PMID:31010682
In a cross-sectional analysis of average-risk adults, we found that rates of CRC screening have increased overall since 2008, they have increased disproportionately in each racial and ethnic group-disparities in screening uptake persist. -- PMID:31525514
The renal cancer cell line, 786-0 was used, and cells was divided into a mock group, negative control group and small hairpin (sh)RNA-Nrf2 group. -- PMID:31186733
However, differentiating mutations that drive the tumor phenotype from mutations that do not affect tumor fitness remains a fundamental challenge in cancer biology. -- PMID:31484939
These results emphasize the great potential for food poisoning by inadequately preserved seafood, and the necessity to upgrade the standards for food quality assessment. -- PMID:31121696
Genital talc use is associated with increased risk for ovarian carcinoma in epidemiologic studies. -- PMID:31305893
Eight adult rabbits were exposed to 4.0 MPa ("ARG4.0MPa"). -- PMID:31794143
We hypothesize that the ENS regulates intestinal permeability and ion flux in the small intestine in response to luminal nutrients. -- PMID:31709828
Twenty-four participants who were diagnosed with stroke were divided into a mild cognitive group (n = 12) and a severe cognitive group (n = 12). -- PMID:31425348
To understand its pathogenic mechanisms, BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were induced to develop the condition by a single intraperitoneal injection of E. coli lipopolysaccharide, the aim of the present work is to determine leukocyte infiltration in an endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in two non-related mouse strains. -- PMID:31626758
PEG10 expressing subcutaneous xenograft and intratibial tumor models were imaged by both modalities using this molecular genetic imaging strategy. -- PMID:31530569
Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and its death receptors TRAILR1/death receptor 4 (DR4) and TRAILR2/DR5 trigger cell death in many cancer cells but rarely exert cytotoxic activity on non-transformed cells. -- PMID:31284696
Furthermore, catechol-rich melanin and melanin-like nanomaterials possess a versatile affinity for various functional organic and inorganic additives, allowing the design of multifunctional hybrid nanomaterials that expand their range of applications in bioimaging, therapy, theranostics, and biosensing. -- PMID:31827881
The methylation of some CpG sites in two gene body regions showed at least moderate positive correlations (Pearson's r > .4) with PPP2R2B expression. -- PMID:31742892
