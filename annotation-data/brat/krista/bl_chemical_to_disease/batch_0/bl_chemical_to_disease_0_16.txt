Seeds of yellowhorn are rich in oil containing unsaturated long-chain fatty acids that have been used for producing edible oil and nervonic acid capsules. -- PMID:31241155
Every 18â€¯days, the animals were monitored for tick count, acaricide treatment, weight, blood pack cell volume, and clinical signs. -- PMID:31014808
Silencing of NUP107 increased the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells to oxidative challenge, thereby inducing the apoptosis of cervical cancer cells. -- PMID:31487736
A systematic investigation of the effect of (i) post-production annealing, (ii) dissolved oxygen levels during photocatalysis and (iii) reactor configuration on the stability and photocatalytic activity (PCA) of ZnO nanowires, grown on either flat or circular supports, was conducted. -- PMID:31238260
Phloretin plus metformin improved fasting blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic rats. -- PMID:31821397
However, researchers face a lack of molecular tools to probe the importance of site-specific acetylation events in vivo. -- PMID:31480793
Abatacept was well tolerated in this population of PBC patients but like other biologics in PBC was ineffective in achieving biochemical responses associated with improved clinical outcomes. -- PMID:31027870
He had eventual progression and worsening of his disease and performance status and was transitioned to hospice. -- PMID:31123644
Short Term Results of Fibrin Gel Obtained from Cord Blood Units: A Preliminary in Vitro Study. -- PMID:31382445
The dosage of CTAB should be moderate; too high or too low will decay the ordering degree of the lamellar structure.A much higher concentration of NaOH resulted in an ethanol-rich solvent in which the DHAA did not solubilize in the micelles of CTAB, but adsorbed at the hydrophilic headgroup-solvent interface. -- PMID:31026266
We validated that cpd5 selectively displaces Kv2.1-syntaxin-binding peptides from syntaxin and, at higher concentrations, munc18, but without affecting either synaptic or neuronal intrinsic properties in brain tissue slices at neuroprotective concentrations. -- PMID:31308225
Blood, plasma and EAT biopsies were collected for molecular and proteomic assays. -- PMID:31316160
Thus, the developed CdS/PPT/ITO-based PEC sensor achieved excellent chlorpyrifos biosensing with improved sensitivity down to approximately ng/mL level with good specificity. -- PMID:31560517
As such, we recently had a less prepared encounter of pulmonary nocardial infection in an ANCA-associated renal vasculitis patient under steroid therapy. -- PMID:31337957
The incidence of GDM in the intervention group was 18. 37%, and the incidence rate in the control group was 28. -- PMID:31133099
Among the 643 men (median age, 72 years [range, 43-93 years]) in PREVAIL, early and late unconfirmed lesions were observed in 177 men (27.5%) with stable disease or disease responding to enzalutamide. -- PMID:31830211
Glutamate, a pivotal N-containing molecule, is responsible for the biosynthesis of proline (Pro), arginine (Arg) and ornithine (Orn) and constitutes a main common pathway for PAs and C/N assimilation/incorporation implicated in various stresses. -- PMID:31480342
Background To investigate the clinical and molecular characteristics of Chinese children with maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). -- PMID:31216263
To our knowledge, this is the first DRONJ case treated with using the ultrasonic piezoelectric bone surgery combined with leukocyte and platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF) and pedicled buccal fat pad flap (PBFP). -- PMID:31299805
Investigation of miRNA- and lncRNA-mediated competing endogenous RNA network in cholangiocarcinoma. -- PMID:31612038
