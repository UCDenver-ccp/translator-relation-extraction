Emerging evidence indicates that the crosstalk between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle is critical in maintaining insulin sensitivity and lipid homeostasis. -- PMID:31339170
In particular, we studied the in vitro aggregation of insulin and two alloforms of β amyloid peptides. -- PMID:31223651
Low phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis (LPAC) syndrome is characterized by early intrahepatic and symptomatic gallstones leading to cholangitis, acute pancreatitis and biliary colic. -- PMID:31538486
The aim of this study was to investigate gefitinib resistance in glioblastoma, and explore ways to circumvent this significant clinical problem. -- PMID:31565489
Although the molecular basis for PEM continues to be characterized, findings to date suggest that this category of melanocytic neoplasia has genetic alterations distinct from those seen in common nevi, dysplastic nevi, Spitz nevi, and melanoma. -- PMID:31437301
Here, we developed a novel nano-micellar fenretinide formulation called bionanofenretinide (Bio-nFeR), based on drug encapsulation in an ion-pair stabilized lipid matrix, with the aim to raise fenretinide bioavailability and antitumour efficacy. -- PMID:31439019
CUR administration decreased the levels of uric acid (UA), creatinine (CRE) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in serum. -- PMID:31362244
A novel method for rapid detection of a Helicobacter pylori infection using a γ-glutamyltranspeptidase-activatable fluorescent probe. -- PMID:31263136
Switching patients' treatment from enalapril to sacubitril/valsartan at 8 weeks after randomization led to a further 37% reduction in NT-proBNP levels in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and a recent hospitalization for ADHF. -- PMID:31825471
Our results show that the primary PG rays from nuclear interactions of the primary beam exhibit the closest correlation to the beam range but its signal is significantly masked by the concurrent secondary PG rays, particularly for heavier ions such as carbon ion beams. -- PMID:31153395
Weekly use of disinfectants to clean surfaces only (23% exposed) or to clean medical instruments (19% exposed) was not associated with incident asthma (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] for surfaces, 1.12 [0.87-1.43]; -- PMID:31692020

We aimed to assess the updated age-standardized prevalence of H. pylori infection in asymptomatic subjects and in patients with dyspepsia and to assess the accuracy of H. pylori stool antigen (HpSA) test for screening of H. pylori in Chinese population. -- PMID:31408909
Clinical responses are associated with an adenosine-regulated gene expression signature in pre-treatment tumor biopsies. -- PMID:31732494
Breast cancer (BC) and thyroid cancer (TC) are common malignancies among females. -- PMID:31042767
Furthermore, consecutive analyses using MSA-CID (multistage activation collision-induced dissociation) and HCD (higher-energy collisional dissociation) fragmentation at the MS2 stage increases the depth of phosphorylation analysis. -- PMID:31799850
OD may be caused by olfactory epithelial damage and suppression of OMP expression in nasal allergic inflammation and could be reversed using an intranasal steroid. -- PMID:31743968
