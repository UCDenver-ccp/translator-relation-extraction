The results demonstrated that AMP-Na significantly inhibited the proliferation, clonogenicity and migration of human lung adenocarcinoma cells. -- PMID:31289488
We found, using a multiple linear regression model, that age, blood glucose and urine metabolites (malate, fumarate and α-hydroxyisobutyrate) were significant predictive factors of OAB severity. -- PMID:31813035
On the other hand, the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, a new class of cancer therapeutics, in SCCHN patients has been confirmed, in addition to anti-human EGFR monoclonal antibody products. -- PMID:31189809
In our series of FTLD-TDP cases, we found that those lacking the C9orf72 mutation (non-C9) were all readily classified as type A (n = 29), B (n = 16) or C (n = 18), using current criteria and standard observational methods. -- PMID:31501924
The lactulose/mannitol ratio was greater in boys with IBS compared with HC boys at both time points (both P = .02). -- PMID:31820520
Rebound Thrombocytosis after Induction Chemotherapy is a Strong Biomarker for Favorable Outcome in AML Patients. -- PMID:31723819
We describe a two-step cross-linking strategy for the fabrication of a P(AAm-AMPS)/alginate double-network hydrogel in the presence of air, which enables greater independent control over surface chemistry and functionality than homogeneously processed conventional double-network hydrogels. -- PMID:31264828
Implementation of an intraleukocitary cystine quantification method for diagnosis of cystinosis. -- PMID:31740152
These findings suggest that glial ion transporters are involved in tissue structural and functional restoration, or brain injury and neurological disease development and progression. -- PMID:31418931
The cell viability and cell attachment of drug loaded single layer and tri-layer nanofibers toward the MCF-7 breast cancer cells were examined to achieve an optimum nanofibrous formulation for the breast cancer treatment. -- PMID:31005745
In its basis in the essential role of angiogenesis for tumor growth and metastasis, angioprevention proposes the use of inhibitors of angiogenesis in cancer prevention. -- PMID:31480406
Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Supports Independent Membrane-Interfacial Fusion Peptide and Transmembrane Domains in Subunit 2 of Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin Protein, a Structured and Aqueous-Protected Connection between the Fusion Peptide and Soluble Ectodomain, and the Importance of Membrane Apposition by the Trimer-of-Hairpins Structure. -- PMID:31008587
Thus, more evidence is needed to understand the impact of maternal GDM on offspring's adiposity, glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, risk of fatty liver disease, and pubertal onset. -- PMID:31754898
These parameters were established by evaluating histopathological changes, HCC markers such as glutathione S-transferase placental-1 (Gstp1), Cytokeratin-19 (Ck19) and prostaglandin reductase-1 (Ptgr1); that of Cyp2e1, a DEN metabolizing enzyme; and the expression of the proliferation marker Ki67. -- PMID:31176654
Characterization of mRNA Expression and Endogenous RNA Profiles in Bladder Cancer Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database. -- PMID:31020952
Patients in group 2 (n = 23) had either a scarred urethra or evidence of lichen sclerosus and underwent staged repair using a buccal mucosa graft. -- PMID:31262655
To assess the long-term risk factors predicting residual/recurrent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2-3) and time to recurrence after large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ). -- PMID:31631477
Indolent T-cell lymphoproliferative disease (T-LPD) of gastrointestinal tract is a rare recently described disease that seldom progresses. -- PMID:31027102
