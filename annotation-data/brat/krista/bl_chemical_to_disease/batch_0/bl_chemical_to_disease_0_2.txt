Our results provide important recommendations for screening virus and tumor-specific peptides among the population with prevalent HLA supertypes for vaccine development and immune interventions. -- PMID:31396224
The viral protein corona directs viral pathogenesis and amyloid aggregation. -- PMID:31133680
The study aims, in infertile men, (i) to assess oxidative stress parameters in semen plasma and (ii) to study the effect of antioxidants in those with abnormal semen parameters. -- PMID:31576077
The neuropeptide Y system affects various processes, among others food intake, and is frequently discussed in the context of targeting obesity. -- PMID:31533726
Desorption Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization Coupled with Ion Mobility-Mass Spectrometry. -- PMID:31729664
The study confirmed that ciclosporin is able to pass the blood-brain barrier in a TBI population and provided an initial biomarker-based signal of efficacy. -- PMID:31210099
Efficacy of water spray for evaporative cooling in athletes with spinal cord injury. -- PMID:31632709
Herein, we described a novel microwave-assisted polymerized composite hydrogel that was comprised of salecan/poly(diacetone acrylamide) (PDAAm) network and tantalum carbide (TaC) nanoparticles. -- PMID:31145950
Notably, we found knockdown of genes involved in protein trafficking pathways to be detrimental to parasite infection. -- PMID:31257182
A high-fat diet promotes CRC risk through stimulated bile acid metabolism, facilitating bile acid conversion by the gut microbiota to tumor-promoting deoxycholic acid. -- PMID:31792624
Thus, Nano Se or/and VE can be used effectively in tilapia diets for improving the growth, intestinal health, blood health, oxidative status, and immune-related gene expression. -- PMID:31396852
A light-up near-infrared probe with aggregation-induced emission characteristics for highly sensitive detection of alkaline phosphatase. -- PMID:31566642
Perioperative outcome parameters were average operation time in and out, operation duration, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative hemodynamic parameters, preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin, blood transfusion rate, total patient-controlled anesthesia (PCA) morphine usage, length of postoperative hospitalization and complications. -- PMID:31574058
Congenital microcephaly comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders in which brain volume is reduced, in the absence or presence of variable syndromic features. -- PMID:31035417
Despite these sobering statistics, most bioinformatics and computational biology research and funding to date has been concentrated predominantly on cancer research, with a relatively modest footprint in CVD. -- PMID:31802103
Overexpression of SREBP1a enhanced the hepatic expression of key genes in glycolysis-gluconeogenesis (glucokinase and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase), fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2), elongation (elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 5) and desaturation (fatty acid desaturase 2) as well as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate production (glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase) and cholesterol synthesis (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase), leading to increased blood triglycerides and cholesterol levels. -- PMID:31344838
Skin self-examination (SSE) is a health behaviour that can lead to early detection of melanoma and more positive health outcomes. -- PMID:31229210
From the total SOS population (n = 4047), we identified 4033 obese individuals with no history of heart failure at baseline, of whom 2003 underwent bariatric surgery (surgery group) and 2030 received usual care (control group). -- PMID:31089682
