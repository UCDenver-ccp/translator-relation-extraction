This provides the rationale and opportunity to include a rare tumor like PSCC in future 'basket type' trials using novel agents targeting multiple SCCs that may exhibit similar biology. -- PMID:31045928
Severe complications like retinal detachment are rare but exist. -- PMID:31346704
Our aim was to review both the efficacy and problem associated with PUPS mono- and combination therapy conducted in China and the underlying molecular mechanisms. -- PMID:31030753
More has to be investigated about pathogenesis of the disease and influence of the hormonal balance on it. -- PMID:31372929
Diagnosis of the distinct condition can be identified by conventional chromosome analysis and small deletions by novel molecular cytogenetic methods such as microarray comparative genome hybridization (aCGH). -- PMID:31261151
Means to identify and isolate fibroblasts as well as an understanding of their cancer-specific features are essential to dissect their role in tumor biology. -- PMID:31428583
Here, we developed a highly efficient bioreactor to generate high titers of HuNoV-specific IgY in chicken yolks using a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing HuNoV capsid protein (rVSV-VP1) as an antigen. -- PMID:31100802
Anopheles vectors of human malaria in Africa and Asia are ubiquitously colonized by RNA viruses, some of which are monophyletic but clearly diverged from other arthropod viruses. -- PMID:31429704
However, genetic deficiency of LCN2 altered neither the development of diet-induced obesity, nor the ability of celastrol to promote weight loss and improve obesity-associated dyshomeostasis. -- PMID:31488870
Over the last few decades, several delayed-start trials have suggested that early introduction of dopamine replacement therapy can improve the prognosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). -- PMID:31346142
In the present study, we demonstrate that a single pulmonary exposure to multi-walled carbon nanotubes dramatically enhances angiogenesis and the invasiveness of orthotopically implanted mammary carcinoma, leading to metastasis and rapid colonization of the lungs and other organs. -- PMID:31235893
Retinal Complications in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Patients Treated with Antimalarial Drugs. -- PMID:31474597
Docetaxel-based chemotherapy combined with dexamethasone can achieve excellent survival efficacy not only in M0 castration-resistant prostate cancer patients, but also in M1 castration-resistant prostate cancer patients. -- PMID:31055879
A high index of suspicion for the presence of a pathological lead-point in children older than 4Â years and children with recurrent intussusception is necessary in patients presenting with intussusception. -- PMID:31139892
However, a main side effect is chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), which may lead to changes in chemotherapeutic treatment. -- PMID:31260808
This paper aimed to identify new candidate biomarkers in blood for early diagnosis of CRC. -- PMID:31749922
The observed improvements in CV and renal outcomes with SGLT-2is in CVOTs suggest a class effect in this patient population and have influenced treatment guidelines for the way add-on therapy to metformin is initiated in patients with T2D and high CV risk. -- PMID:31407866
Conclusion: PcG associated protein RYBP displays a reduced expression in HCC tissues, which is related to poor prognosis of HCC patients. -- PMID:31113915
Combining clinical data with biochemical measurements is currently the most likely path toward improved detection and prediction of outcome in neonatal HIE. -- PMID:31324315
The combination of tantalum augments that provide strong structural support and antibiotic-loaded allograft is successful in the mid-term in single-stage revisions for infection. -- PMID:31236707
