MATERIAL AND METHODS Human cervical cancer HeLa cells were treated with different concentrations of doxorubicin for 3 days, with or without subsequent extended culture in drug-free medium for 6 days. -- PMID:31092810
Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression levels of CSE in human breast cancer tissues and cells. -- PMID:31173185
Our protein-protein interaction network indicates that the common DEGs, Cyclin B/cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), CCND1, ESR1 and Aurora kinase A (AURKA), are the top four hub genes. -- PMID:31642613
[ALLERGIC DISEASES AND NON-CODING RNA]. -- PMID:31827027
PAH derivatives show high retention coefficient in all cases, whereas in the case of carbamate-pesticides micellar retention might be significantly reduced and is very limited in the case of liposomes. -- PMID:31277031
The UV-visible study reveals severe reduction of the pigments such as chlorophyll (Chl), carotenoids and xanthophylls in the tea leaf due to mite infestation. -- PMID:31749250
The results of this study might facilitate the preparation or late-stage modification of complex flavonoids as anti-cancer drug candidates. -- PMID:31064088
Although amyloid fibrils are known to have multiple binding sites, we demonstrated that model 2MXU possesses one site which is druggable and can bind with common scaffolds currently being used in the imaging of amyloid fibrils. -- PMID:31756663
Adding calcification buffer (CB: calcium chloride [7 mM] and β-glycerophosphate [7 mM]) increased the CP of control sera to approximate that of CKD sera. -- PMID:31519772
We describe the case of an isolated thyroid metastasis from clear cell renal carcinoma occurring 16 years after nephrectomy. -- PMID:31258806
Sitagliptin may inhibit the tubulointerstitial Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway in diabetic nephropathy and provide renal protection by alleviatinge renal tubulointerstitial transdifferentiation and fibrosis. -- PMID:31412145
The coupled domain motions and interactions between the enzyme and the RNA-DNA hybrid provide new insights into the mechanism of genome editing by Cas9. -- PMID:31285607

To assess the effect of an SPB with pharmacist intervention on medication adherence in adult patients with multiple myeloma (MM) new to lenalidomide therapy (≤ 5 cycle dispenses). -- PMID:31663462
After clinical examinations, including heart rates (HRs), capillary refill times (CRTs), abdominal sounds, rectal palpations, and nasogastric (NG) reflux assessments in both healthy and diseased horses, blood samples were collected and hematologic parameters, coagulation indices such as the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), plasma d-dimer (PDD), platelet count, fibrinogen, and hepatorenal biomarkers were measured. -- PMID:31531891
In conclusion, PTH was positively associated with an increase in uACR in elderly Korean men and women but was not associated with a decrease in eGFR. -- PMID:31625125
The presence of minerals was also analyzed indirectly with AFM, as the collagen fibril pattern was less evident in the mineralized tissue. -- PMID:31313823
