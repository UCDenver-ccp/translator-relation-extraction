DNA from the proband was used for CMT gene panel testing (including 50 genes, PMP22 duplication and mtDNA). -- PMID:31173493
This pronounced size dependence is interpreted in terms of discrete dipole simulations of the internal electric field in the nanoparticles, which reveal that the internal field is enhanced in the forward propagation direction of the laser pulses, occurring for nanoparticles >100 nm. -- PMID:31140488
Distant metastases from follicular thyroid carcinoma are mainly hematogenous and are commonly observed in the lungs and bones. -- PMID:31747942
IPF shares several clinical, genetic and biological features with other ILDs exhibiting the UIP pattern. -- PMID:31261211
Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disease with high mortality, characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis, which are processes associated with higher serum tumor necrosis factor-α (sTNF-α) levels. -- PMID:31353423
The change in fasting blood glucose was -43.0 ± 83.5 mg/dl in the intervention group and -16.3 ± 77.2 mg/dl in the control group, leading to an adjusted difference of -21.3 mg/dl (95% CI: 18.4 to -61 mg/dl; p = 0.29). -- PMID:31523014
It is well described that there are no worldwide treatments for PCOS and all of pharmacological treatments are off -label without any approval. -- PMID:31494172

Each session was 90 min of 100% oxygen at 2 ATA with 5 min air breaks every 20 min, 5 days per week. -- PMID:31409407
YAP (Yes-associated protein) is a key component of the Hippo pathway and was recently suggested to promote epithelial cell regeneration for IBD recovery. -- PMID:31018132
Thus co-treatment with ATR inhibitors might be a promising strategy for enhancement of cisplatin treatment efficiency in breast cancer patients. -- PMID:31189884
Between January 2013 and January 2016, a total of 30 672 adult nontraumatic OHCA with resuscitation were identified, from whom 20 804 were included, 2711 in the E-ALS group and 18 093 in the control group. -- PMID:31466139
XBP1 inhibits mesangial cell apoptosis in response to oxidative stress via the PTEN/AKT pathway in diabetic nephropathy. -- PMID:31077568
The research was conducted on the group of 160 people aged from 18 to 47 years, including 74 people at increased risk for EDs. -- PMID:31068882
Longer duration of diabetes and HbA1c remained associated with prevalent DR in both groups after adjusting for potential risk factors. -- PMID:31407162
We investigated whether thymoquinone (TQ) exerts a beneficial effect on renal injury due to amikacin (AK) administration in rats. -- PMID:31502890
Furthermore, the endothelial cells incubated under hypoxic condition or treated with DMOG or hypoxia enhanced monocyte adhesion, which was inhibited by silencing Arg-II. -- PMID:31474872
