VEGFR1 cleavage upon treatment with WT-derived exosomes, Î”exon4-derived exosomes, or the pan-MMP inhibitor GM60001 was examined via in vitro proteolysis analysis using recombinant mouse (rm) VEGFR1/R2. -- PMID:31117124
expression was associated with trisomy 12. CLL cells from an idelalisib-treated patient showed decreased sensitivity to idelalisib in vitro concomitant with enhanced MAPK signaling and strong upregulation of IGF1R upon idelalisib exposure. -- PMID:31010847
Multitargeted Nanoparticles Deliver Synergistic Drugs across the Blood-Brain Barrier to Brain Metastases of Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells and Tumor-Associated Macrophages. -- PMID:31348614
Our findings indicate the R270H/R273H p53 mutant protein does not manifest definite GOF biological effects in mouse and human CRCs, suggesting possible GOF effects of mutant p53 in cancer phenotypes are likely allele-specific and/or context-dependent. -- PMID:31148594
CUS-induced depression-like behaviors were accompanied by a significant decrease in both the dopamine (DA) level and D2R expression in the NAc. -- PMID:31556781
(-)-Epicatechin metabolites promote vascular health through epigenetic reprogramming of endothelial-immune cell signaling and reversing systemic low-grade inflammation. -- PMID:31756325
Such a strategy may offer effective mitigation of the dangerous localized corrosion aggravated by minor imperfections or damage in protective coatings, which are typically hard to prevent or detect, but can drastically degrade metal properties. -- PMID:31549058
No significant differences were observed in the expression levels of miRs in PE-GDM group. -- PMID:31487656
Dimensional measurement sensitivity is assessed through analyzing scatterfield images measured at the edge area of periodic multiline structures with nominal linewidths ranging 44-80 nm on a Molybdenum Silicide (MoSi) photomask. -- PMID:31684249
Compared with the control group, narrowed facet joint cartilage but increased proliferative chondrocytes and upregulated collagen type II (COL2A1) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl2) were observed in IS patients. -- PMID:31337422
Besides that, part of the therapeutic effects of antiangiogenic antibodies, including their role in the tumor vascular network, might be triggered by Fc receptors in an antigen-independent manner. -- PMID:31156623
The analysis of drinking pattern of these animals in a free-choice alcohol drinking paradigm revealed higher alcohol intake and preference in Asm-/- mice compared to wild type (wt) littermates. -- PMID:31333574
In the present study, the role of macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) in tumor advancement of HCC was investigated. -- PMID:31381879
Exome sequencing of oral leukoplakia and oral squamous cell carcinoma implicates DNA damage repair gene defects in malignant transformation. -- PMID:31422212
Finally, we detected that GPX4 inhibited ferroptosis in cancer cells, the inhibition of GPX4 via RSL3 could enhance the anticancer effect of cisplatin in vitro and in vivo. -- PMID:31556117
Surprisingly, hypoxia preferentially blocks HDAC inhibitor-induced differentiation of the BRCA1-reconstituted breast cancer cells. -- PMID:31273285
Patterns of enrichment were confirmed on the complete data set, that is, including cleft palate inactives, and putative molecular initiating events identified. -- PMID:31471948
Core-sheath nanostructured chitosan-based nonwovens as a potential drug delivery system for periodontitis treatment. -- PMID:31593733
Following general anesthesia, OCT scans of the optic nerve and retina were acquired using an HRA+OCT Spectralis with Flex module (Heidelberg Engineering). -- PMID:31271744
In the tumor physiological environment, the particle size of the PPSP micelles and the release rate of paclitaxel (PTX) were significantly increased compared with those of mPEG-PBLA-CC-PTX (PPCP) micelles, reflecting the excellent redox-sensitive activity of the PPSP micelles. -- PMID:31508374
