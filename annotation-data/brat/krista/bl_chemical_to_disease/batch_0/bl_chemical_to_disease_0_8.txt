Papillary thyroid cancer was detected in five patients (9.6%) as a result of pathologic examination. -- PMID:31142405
Polyamines: The possible missing link between mental disorders and epilepsy (Review). -- PMID:31746386
Based on the high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) for metabonomics and on various software and bioinformatic analysis methods, we found that BPA could affect fatty acid and glucose metabolism, block the TCA cycle, and BPA also regulated the nuclear receptor LXR caused hypoglycemia, thereby affecting the normal metabolic functions of the liver. -- PMID:31715463
Hematoxylin and eosin staining and electron microscopy ofliver showed signs ofinjury after 12 hours of cold storage, which included mainly cytoplasmic edema characterized by loose liver cell arrangement, increased hepatic sinus fissure, mitochondrial swelling, and nuclear pyknosis. -- PMID:31724923
 was the pathogen of this outbreak, and water from the shallow wells might be responsible for the source of infection. -- PMID:31484266
We demonstrate here that PAI-1 plays a key role in depression by a mechanism independent of the tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (tPA) - Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) axis, but associated with impaired metabolisms of serotonin and dopamine. -- PMID:31610810
The severe periodontitis group had a significant higher HbA1c level (8.53 ± 1.61%) as compared with the mild and moderate periodontitis groups (7.68±1.58%) -- PMID:31049901
Investigating ion channels in their native cell type is important when striving to understand their regulation and function, but this comes with added complexities due to the plethora of channels and receptors present. -- PMID:31646496
Nutrient-rich YP medium with 1% (w/v) Yeast extract and 2% (w/v) Tryptone, as well as 10-fold diluted YP medium, could also be effectively used as nitrogen sources. -- PMID:31748627
Δpep27 immunization suppressed hallmark features of AAD, including antigen-specific type 2 helper T cell cytokine and antibody responses, peripheral and pulmonary eosinophil accumulation, and goblet cell hyperplasia. -- PMID:31029416
We analyzed MR imaging from a prospective data base of 3 age-matched groups: 21 cognitively healthy controls, 20 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 19 patients with early Alzheimer disease. -- PMID:31515217
In conclusion, our results showed that DS exerts antidepressant-like effects in mice with CSDS-induced depression, that the effects may be mediated by the normalization of monoamine neurotransmitter levels, the prevention of HPA axis dysfunction and the impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis, and that this occurs partly through the ability of DS to enhance BDNF expression by increasing the TrkB/CREB/ERK pathway and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. -- PMID:31542427
The resistance to herbicides may contain a non-mutagenic and non-genetic origin. -- PMID:31280423
The levels of serum inflammatory factors interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP) and osteocalcin (OC) were measured and compared by ELISA before treatment and 1 month after treatment in both 2 groups. -- PMID:31792485
Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) may be at an increased risk of liver complications because chronic hyperglycemia is a risk factor for liver fat accumulation and potential liver dysfunction. -- PMID:31001915
Production and Characterization of Glutathione-Chitosan Conjugate Films as Systems for Localized Release of Methotrexate. -- PMID:31817917
Assessment of plasma creatine kinase as biomarker for levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease. -- PMID:31098725
With the spotlight on cancer immunotherapy and the expanding use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, strategies to improve the response rate and duration of current cancer immunotherapeutics are highly sought. -- PMID:31131086
Our findings suggested that BES could be used for short-lived radioisotopes like Pd-103 and Cs-131 in comparison to eluting BDS which is feasible for long-lived radioisotopes like I-125. -- PMID:31084497
The use of dimethyl fumarate has not been reported in treatment-naïve Japanese patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. -- PMID:31218077
