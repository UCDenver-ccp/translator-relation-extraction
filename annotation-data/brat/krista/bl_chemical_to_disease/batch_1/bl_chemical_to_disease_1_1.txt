It is appropriate to initiate anticoagulation in glioblastoma patients with VTEs. -- PMID:31386010
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Our data show for the first time that FlAsH-tagging of ion channels is a promising tool to study conformational changes after channel opening and may significantly advance the analysis of ion channel activation as well as their mutants involved in channelopathies. -- PMID:31171574
Allergenic pollen are natural, biological airborne particles and the main cause of allergic respiratory diseases. -- PMID:31016363
No single nodule feature is an absolute indicator for malignancy. -- PMID:31754540
Reconstruction of the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network based on competitive endogenous RNA reveal functional lncRNAs in Cerebral Infarction. -- PMID:31434962
The 5-year absolute risk of thromboembolic events (taking death into account as a competing risk) in patients with AF grouped according to secondary precipitants were 8.3% (alcohol intoxication), 8.5% (thyrotoxicosis), 12.1% (myocardial infarction), 11.6% (surgery), 12.2% (infection), 10.1% (>1 precipitant) and 12.3% (no secondary precipitant). -- PMID:31542739
Our results show that Nox (NADPH oxidase enzyme) 4-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is deregulated in both diabetes and CRC. -- PMID:31661292
Attenuating dependence on structural data in computing protein energy landscapes. -- PMID:31167640
A 67-year-old female, who died from vomiting and bacterial gastritis one day after placement of two intragastric weight-loss balloons, had elevated concentrations of duloxetine at 1.4 mg/L in the iliac vein blood and 9.3 mg/kg in the liver. -- PMID:31424074
We propose that CAD TB is involved in recruiting Cry1Ac to localize it in a good position for its interaction with the ABCC2, resulting in efficient toxin membrane insertion enhancing Cry1Ac toxicity. -- PMID:31540044
Further workup revealed that circulating tumor-derived DNA and liver metastases originated from a synchronous KRAS-mutated cancer of the pancreas. -- PMID:31134762
Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) accounts for only 0.5-3% of all malignant diseases, but is responsible for more deaths every year than all the other endocrine malignancies taken together. -- PMID:31658309
Role of MCC/Eisosome in Fungal Lipid Homeostasis. -- PMID:31349700
In the field where water immersion is not available it may be necessary to use ice packs or very cold, wet towels placed over as much of the body as possible before transportation of the victim to higher levels of medical care. -- PMID:31201762
Finally, we show that this mode is a sensitive probe for the overall structural integrity of the ribbons and their interaction with technologically relevant substrates. -- PMID:31573799
Treatment of anti-MDA5 autoantibody-positive juvenile dermatomyositis using tofacitinib. -- PMID:31603187
Salivary and serum concentrations of selected pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines in relation to oral lesions among children undergoing maintenance therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. -- PMID:31316289
These studies suggest that human, bovine and mouse CAII are not responsible for nitrite dependent NO formation in red blood cells, aorta or the systemic circulation. -- PMID:31658361
The maximum corresponding to water-water correlations relates to the position of the FDP of HDA ice at ∼1 GPa. -- PMID:31153163
In conclusion, controlling the PVA expansion by decreasing the water/cement (w/c) ratio provides a promising approach to achieve 3D hollow channels in cement and, therefore, makes it possible to create complex tunnels within self-healing cementitious materials. -- PMID:31771222
