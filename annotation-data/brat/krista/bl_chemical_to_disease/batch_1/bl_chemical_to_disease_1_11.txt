Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) plays a vital role in nerve conduction through rapidly hydrolyzing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) and is correlated with Alzheimer's disease. -- PMID:31353389
Accordingly, in the present study, we sought to explore whether TRPV4 is involved in the regulation of Cx expression following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (PISE) in mice. -- PMID:31299321
Urotensin 2 and Oxidative Stress Levels in Maternal Serum in Pregnancies Complicated by Intrauterine Growth Restriction. -- PMID:31269637
In conclusion, faecal miR-21, miR-92a and their combination are promising non-invasive biomarkers for faecal-based CRC screening. -- PMID:31263200
Buffy-coat reduced blood did not influence the outcome in the study group. -- PMID:31360005
As well, our data demonstrated that acute BLM-induced fibrosis was accompanied by an oxidative stress in lung tissue as assessed by an increase of lipid peroxidation as well as antioxidant enzyme activities depletion such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). -- PMID:31155950
We conclude that RT performed in higher volume seems to be the most appropriate strategy to reduce body fat (%), trunk fat, improve blood biomarkers, and reduce composite Z-score in older women. -- PMID:31306389
Therapies that regulate NAD+ and thereby target sirtuins may be beneficial in human diabetic sensory polyneuropathy. -- PMID:31754701
Native-size spider silk genes (up to 10 kb) were inserted into an intron of the fibroin heavy or light chain (FibH or FibL) ensuring that any sequence changes induced by the CRISPR/Cas9 would not impact protein production. -- PMID:31059233
We used time-course RNA-seq data from glioma cells treated with dbcAMP (a cAMP activator) as a realistic case to reconstruct the GRNs for sensitive and resistant cells. -- PMID:31682596
Deficiency in the membrane protein Tmbim3a/Grinaa initiates cold-induced ER stress and cell death by activating an intrinsic apoptotic pathway in zebrafish. -- PMID:31171717
Computed tomography venography and angiography finally indicated that the fever and pain were the symptoms of thrombophlebitis caused by lead extraction. -- PMID:31423444
Their venom and mechanism of injury lead to painful, poor-healing wounds that often become infected. -- PMID:31039230
Overall, our results suggest that adolescence is a critical period of sensitivity and binge drinking that can lead to lasting changes in ethanol intake in adulthood. -- PMID:31326461
Furthermore, somatic mutation signature analysis showed preferential transition of cytosine to thymine residues at CpG dinucleotides in cancer tissues. -- PMID:31322271
Patients were classified into either mild-to-moderate severe group or severe group according to the Revised Atlanta Classification for Acute Pancreatitis. -- PMID:31579249
We found that the protein level of SIRT1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was lower, the protein level in spleen was higher, and phosphorylation of p65 protein in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was reduced. -- PMID:31005957
The incidence trend for anaplastic thyroid cancer over the last 30 years was stable, and the survival rate and median survival time were not significantly improved. -- PMID:31632557
At 400 K, such an evolution of the rotational diffusion coefficient contrasts with quasielastic neutron scattering results predicting a near independence of the rotational diffusion with a pressure increase above â‰ƒ0.5 GPa. -- PMID:31725300
Increase in pro-inflammatory mediators even between febrile attacks in PFAPA suggests that anti-IL1 treatment might be beneficial in these patients. -- PMID:31324971
