Platinum-resistant cancer cells are sensitive to changes in the levels of reactive oxidative species (ROS). -- PMID:31453611
Finally, we consider evidence indicating that histone mutations might be more widespread in cancer than previously thought, and if the perceived bias towards mutation of H3.3 is real or reflects the biology of tumors in which the histone mutants were first identified. -- PMID:31086012
Four major classes of enzymes that attenuate TCR signaling include E3 ubiquitin kinases such as the Casitas B-lineage lymphoma proteins (Cbl-b and c-Cbl), and Itchy (Itch), inhibitory tyrosine phosphatases, such as Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatases (SHP-1 and SHP-2), inhibitory protein kinases, such as C-terminal Src kinase (Csk), and inhibitory lipid kinases such as Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (SHIP) and Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs). -- PMID:31756921
We report on three cases of GvHD developing after solid organ transplantation treated with ruxolitinib. -- PMID:31446673
Effect of Omega-3 and vitamin E co-supplementation on serum lipids concentrations in overweight patients with metabolic disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. -- PMID:31405672
Wogonin has shown to alleviate apoptosis, and ER stress in the cells and this property can also be used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. -- PMID:31298148
This review discusses the therapeutic perspective of small molecule inhibitors of ALKs as drug targets in tumor and stem cells. -- PMID:31059090
Thyroid papillary carcinoma(PTC) is the most common type of thyroid cancer. -- PMID:31327213
Pancreatic Polypeptide-Secreting Tumour of the Proximal Pancreas (PPoma)-Ultra Rare Pancreatic Tumour: Clinically Malign, Histologically Benign. -- PMID:31450729
The high-speed sorting of rare autologous canine patient DCs from the peripheral blood provides the autologous component of fusion vaccines, and fusion to major histocompatibility complex-unmatched CMT cells were produced at high rates. -- PMID:31565891
Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis 'hotspots' and sociodemographic associations in Durban, South Africa. -- PMID:31315705
Expressions of melanoma-associated antigen A1 as a prognostic factor in Chinese patients with resectable oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. -- PMID:31169876
For both men and women and across all ages, the crude predicted probability of depression caseness was the highest in the rural group, followed by the semi-urban group, and the lowest in the urban group. -- PMID:31022250
CSP NMR experiments also show that this mode of bile acid binding has a minor influence on the binding of histo-blood group antigens and vice versa. -- PMID:31644826
Nattokinase (NK), which is a member of the subtilisin family, is a potent fibrinolytic enzyme that might be useful for thrombosis therapy. -- PMID:31064343
To compare the efficacy of drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization combined with radiofrequency ablation (DEB-TACE+RFA) versus DEB-TACE alone in Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.The 28 patients receiving DEB-TACE+RFA and 74 HCC patients receiving DEB-TACE were recruited in this study. -- PMID:31261491
Here we assessed the effect of repeated administration of negative or positive allosteric modulators (NAM or PAM) of mGlu5 on both cognitive performance and (context+cue)-primed cocaine-seeking after prolonged abstinence (≥ 45 days). -- PMID:31446451
Cases were patients with isoniazid resistant tuberculosis (including 78 patients with isoniazid mono-resistant tuberculosis, 42 with polydrug-resistant tuberculosis, and 77 with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis). -- PMID:31429717
Such a facile and efficient self-crosslinking strategy gives the MXene membrane a good antiswelling property for metal ion rejection, which is also suitable for many other 2D materials with tunable surface functional groups during membrane assembly. -- PMID:31480834
