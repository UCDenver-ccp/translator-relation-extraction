Multiscale engineering fully exploits the multi-synergy among components to endow the newly designed metal-free multi-sensing air electrode (MSAE) with bifunctional oxygen reduction and evolution activities, pressure sensitivity, and photothermal and photoelectric conversion functions in a single electrode, enabling effective regulation of interface properties, electronic/ionic transport, or redox reactions in SRZAB upon various stimulations and establishing multiple working principles. -- PMID:31074575
This extensive review of the literature revealed considerable amount of evidence that addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors might boost the immunomodulatory potential of radiotherapy and RCT regimens in SCCHN. -- PMID:31093338
• Poor prognosis regarding pituitary function is expected due to possible permanent pituitary tissue damage that results in the need of permanent hormonal replacement. -- PMID:31446541
We propose that the gut microbiota regulates behaviors in mice via production of neuroactive metabolites, suggesting that gut-brain connections contribute to the pathophysiology of ASD. -- PMID:31150625
In sum, thyroid hormones and prolactin might contribute to the cognitive performance of patients with major mood disorders and psychotic disorders. -- PMID:31612424

Interestingly, when immunosuppressants were used in combination with infliximab (IFX) or 5-aminosalicylic acid, a significantly increased risk of opportunistic infection was also observed. -- PMID:31143074
Here, we review recent data on the mechanisms of ozone induced injury on the different cell types and pathways with a focus on the role of the IL-1 family cytokines and the related IL-33. -- PMID:31608051
Administration of sodium thiosulfate (STS) is the emerging therapy. -- PMID:31251002
All clinically-available ASDs on the market today are effective in at least one of only three preclinical seizure and epilepsy models: the acute maximal electroshock (MES), the acute subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol (scPTZ) test, or the kindled rodent with chronic evoked seizures. -- PMID:31469995
 Verrill (1869) venom contains a pore-forming protein suitable for designing new drugs for cancer therapy. -- PMID:31131002
Our findings demonstrate that FUT8shRNA significantly blocked pericyte activation and the progression of pulmonary fibrosis, achieving intervention effects superior to the small molecule inhibitors. -- PMID:31669139
We examine the regulatory interaction between Hippo-YAP/TAZ and the androgen receptor (AR), as main regulators of PCa development, and how uncontrolled expression of YAP/TAZ drives castration resistance by inducing cellular stemness. -- PMID:31018586
-microglia with an amoeboid hypertrophic form was continually observed in arcuate nucleus of HFD-fed mice during the entire feeding time period. -- PMID:31291887
Importantly, PMPs exhibited remarkably higher toxicity towards cancer cells than free drug and had lower escape into extravascular spaces. -- PMID:31645903
Pathological complete response after afatinib treatment of stage IV oligometastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung: the role of pulmonary surgery. -- PMID:31720896
