Targeting ADP-ribosylation by PARP inhibitors in acute myeloid leukaemia and related disorders. -- PMID:31028744
Plasma levels of selected circulating miRNAs were then assessed in combination with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hsTnT) and N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). -- PMID:31781298
The anti-tumor effect of GnRHa is similar to that of surgical castration or chemotherapy, through reversibly inhibiting ovarian function and downregulating the estrogen level in premenopausal female. -- PMID:31014048
Targeting Human Thrombus by Liposomes Modified with Anti-Fibrin Protein Binders. -- PMID:31810280
A group of cytoprotective genes is regulated by heterodimers composed of the cap'n'collar (CNC) family member Nrf2 and one of the small Maf (sMaf) proteins (MafF, MafG, or MafK) through the antioxidant response element (ARE, also referred to as the CNC-sMaf binding element [CsMBE]). -- PMID:31383749
A Kaplan-Meier curve showed a significantly lower 365-day survival rate in the high-UA/AKI group than in the other groups. -- PMID:31321285
