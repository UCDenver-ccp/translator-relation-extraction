However, amyloid fibrils are also found in a functional context, whereby their structural, mechanical and thermodynamic properties are exploited by biological systems. -- PMID:31654060
We established that activation of the transmembrane molecule aminopeptidase N (ANPEP, also known as CD13) tethers the IQ motif containing, guanosine triphosphate hydrolase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) scaffolding protein at the plasma membrane, thus stimulating the recycling regulator ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) to ensure proper recycling of β1-integrin and other membrane components impacting cell attachment. -- PMID:31692781
Triclosan-induced liver and brain injury in zebrafish (Danio rerio) via abnormal expression of miR-125 regulated by PKCα/Nrf2/p53 signaling pathways. -- PMID:31627110
These observational data show that, despite their high-risk profile, more than half of patients under LLT, both men and women, did not achieve the recommended target levels for LDL-C, and a large proportion also had abnormal HDL-C and/or TG. -- PMID:31706732
Genetic Biomarkers For Hepatocellular Carcinoma In The Era Of Precision Medicine. -- PMID:31696097
Dose-dependent effect of aerobic exercise on inflammatory biomarkers in a randomized controlled trial of women at high risk of breast cancer. -- PMID:31568587
Activities of enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in erythrocytes and heart tissue and the levels of nonenzymatic antioxidants like vitamin C, vitamin E, and reduced glutathione (GSH) in plasma and heart tissue were decreased in ISO-induced rats. -- PMID:31313346
However, MTNR1B loss in chordoma mediated increased CSC properties, chemoresistance, and tumor progression by releasing melatonin's repression of β-catenin signaling. -- PMID:31140197
Most data identified concerned the human cytomegalovirus (CMV), and meta-analysis of eligible studies revealed that evidence of CMV-infection was associated approximately three-fold with MD compared to controls, however the timing of the infections was indeterminate as the pooled analyses combined antiviral serological markers with viral nucleic acid markers. -- PMID:31756230
Also, faster improvements in QoL lead to better patient compliance, but very few studies compare psoriasis traditional and biologic therapies timing. -- PMID:31306540
Deep circumferential calcium fracture after coronary lithotripsy. -- PMID:31826825
A triple-blinded controlled trial was conducted among 45 female RA patients with CP randomized into three treatment groups as follows: Group A: scaling and root planing (SRP) with 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash as an adjunct (n = 15), Group B: SRP with MEC as an adjunct (n = 15), and Group C: SRP alone (n = 15). -- PMID:31745043
Our patient had an Ocular Trauma Score of 1, considering right retinal detachment and perforating injury. -- PMID:31807376
experiments showed that our GOx-loaded peptide hydrogel exhibits outstanding antimicrobial activity while can efficiently reduce glucose concentration of blood samples, showing great potential as promising diabetic wound dressings. -- PMID:31492216
The simulated ion distributions explain the spectroscopic evidence of surface perturbation by soft ions with a negative surface excess consistent with an increased surface tension of salt solutions. -- PMID:31361137
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of cancer biology. -- PMID:31384241
Inhibition of the aberrant A1CF-FAM224A-miR-590-3p-ZNF143 positive feedback loop attenuated malignant biological behaviors of glioma cells. -- PMID:31186064
Participants completed a general questionnaire that asked about education, occupation, number of children, delivery method, history of infant hospitalization, breastfeeding, mothers' and infants' ages, cause of infertility (ART group), and history of depression. -- PMID:31710187
A mixed-method study including a survey on risk factors for breast cancer and understanding of alcohol content. -- PMID:31209091
The concordance of a lymphocytic response to viral antigens and insulin suggests that the viruses of the family Paramyxoviridae in some persons initiate a cascade of immune reactions leading to the development of diabetes, the tatter's type is determined by the nature of an immune system response to viral antigens and insulin. -- PMID:31627662
