Inducing necrosis is also important in attracting more immune cells to the cancer site via the release of danger-associated molecular patterns from cancer cells. -- PMID:31362953
In this review, we focus on the influence of IL-10, IL-4 and TGF-β on various types of cancer as well as potential of these selected cytokines to serve as new biomarkers which can support effective therapies for cancer patients. -- PMID:31530989
These findings suggest that trauma in the absence of PTSD diagnosis does not lead to stronger craving for alcohol. -- PMID:31812999
The histopathological changes of myocardial were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukins (IL-1β and IL-6) in serum and myocardial were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Western Blot was used to detect the expression of the marker proteins of ERS in myocardial, including glucose regulatory protein 78 (GRP78), C/EBP cyclic adenosine phosphate reaction primitive binding transcription factor homologous protein (CHOP), caspase-12 and caspase-3. -- PMID:31771727
