Taken together, the results suggested that IPreC decreased ischemic brain injury through alleviating free radical injury and the inflammatory response in cerebral IR rats. -- PMID:31410157
The aim of the study was to assess biometric factor aberrations and differences among groups of eyes with cataract and pseudoexfoliative syndrome, cataract and pseudoexfoliative glaucoma, and cataract and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), and to determine biometric factors of the eye specific for the group of glaucomatous patients with pseudoexfoliative syndrome by use of optical low-coherence reflectometry. -- PMID:31363329
