The treatment for advanced primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is sorafenib (SORA), while HCC has become increasingly drug resistant with enhanced aerobic glycolysis. -- PMID:31101057
In summary, we have described a novel non-esterified free fatty acid-stimulated pathway selectively driving pancreatic islet NGSIS, which may be therapeutically exploited as an alternative way to halt fasting hyperinsulinemia and the progression of type 2 diabetes. -- PMID:31740442
Metalloproteinases and their Inhibitors under the Course of Immunostimulation by CPG-ODN and Specific Antigen Inhalation in Equine Asthma. -- PMID:31316303
Renal actinomycosis was confirmed via cultures of both the abscess and nephrectomy specimen which grew A israelii and the pathological findings of multiple renal abscesses of actinomycosis with the characteristics of sulfur granules. -- PMID:31804331
In contrast to that, the protein expression of GLUT 2 was significantly increased 48 h p. i., associated with a significantly higher intracellular glucose level in infected cells compared with control cells at that time point of infection. -- PMID:31667591
Parkinson's disease (PD) is managed primarily by dopamine agonists and physiotherapy while virtual reality (VR) has emerged recently as a complementary method. -- PMID:31808000
Biodetoxification of model ZEN-contaminated maize kernels showed the surface-displayed L. reuteri strain could completely hydrolyze 2.5 mg/kg ZEN within 4 h under low water condition. -- PMID:31628520
The temporal expressions of endogenous OPN and autophagy-related proteins (Beclin 1, ATG5, LC3 II to I ratio) were measured in sham and SAH rats at different time points (3, 6, 12, 24, and 72 hours). -- PMID:31436915
Curcumin (CU), an edible natural pigment from Curcuma Longa, has demonstrated extensive anti-tumor effect in vivo and in vitro. -- PMID:31336310
The lack of CTRS in the isolated LPRS group is likely due to esophageal acid hyposensitivity and fewer pharyngeal acid reflux episodes, thus implicating distinct pathophysiology of isolated LPRS from those with CTRS. -- PMID:31546059
Indications included pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (24 trials), fetal neuroprotection (7 trials), and tocolysis (9 trials); 18 trials compared magnesium sulphate with placebo/no treatment, and 22 compared different regimens. -- PMID:31809499
Cardiac motion artifacts frequently reduce the interpretability of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) images and potentially lead to misinterpretations or preclude the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). -- PMID:31299452
Methods An animal model of autism was induced by intraperitoneal injection of valproic acid (VPA) at 12.5 days of gestation in Wistar rats. -- PMID:31030717
Western blotting was performed on the four keloid-derived primary cell lines for mRNA and protein expression of these proteins, respectively. -- PMID:31348346
Of the 768 public respondents, 84% were willing to take a medication that would aid fracture healing but only 62.6% if the medication was lithium. -- PMID:31470828
