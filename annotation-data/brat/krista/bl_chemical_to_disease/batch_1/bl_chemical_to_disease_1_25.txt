These results represent a further step in understanding the parasite effector molecules that may be associated to virulence and thus to disease traits as abortion and transmission. -- PMID:31681630
Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that, no matter in total group or subgroup stratified by tumor stage and grade, overall survival rates at 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years in patients with palliative resection were significantly worse than those in patients with curative resection (all p < 0.05), but significantly better than those in patients with no resection (all p < 0.05). -- PMID:31090037
The molecular chaperone Hsp90α deficiency causes retinal degeneration by disrupting Golgi organization and vesicle transportation in photoreceptors. -- PMID:31408169
Using the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan in the cuticle proteins to quantify the amount of cuticle deposition failed because of complex quenching processes. -- PMID:31164080
Type 1 diabetes was induced by IV injection of alloxan monohydrate 110 mg/kg into New Zealand white rabbits weighing 2-2.5 kg. -- PMID:31231500
Uses include confirmation of intubation, maintenance of ventilation in intubated and nonintubated children, monitoring of effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and as an adjunct for monitoring of sedated children and children with lower respiratory disease and metabolic derangements. -- PMID:31692301

Quantification of bacteria in water using PLS analysis of emission spectra of fluorescence and excitation-emission matrices. -- PMID:31670087
mRNA of LIN28B was expressed in sarcoma cell lines including OS13, but its expression was not detectable in normal organs other than the testis and placenta. -- PMID:31705593
Constipation did not lead to any significant differences in weight/BMI changes during inpatient treatment. -- PMID:31617610
DNA from samples was used for next generation sequencing to identify mutations in genes: HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, IDH1, CHEK2, PPM1D, EIF1AX, EZH1 and for capillary sequencing in case of the TERT promoter. -- PMID:31085772
Now that the genetic and molecular mechanisms of NCMD are known, these may provide clues into the pathogenesis of CT. -- PMID:31367689
Most of these tumors are in 3 groups: radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma including poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, and progressive medullary thyroid carcinoma. -- PMID:31672300
Using the Ion Torrent platform, we developed a low-cost next-generation sequencing gene panel that has been transferred into clinical practice, replacing single disease-gene analyses for the early diagnosis of individuals with ID/ASD. -- PMID:31209962
In addition, plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels were decreased with a concomitant decrease in the expression of lipase adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in adipose tissue. -- PMID:31696216
In this study, we have successfully synthesized another novel photo-responsive single-walled nanoscroll (SWNS) of niobate by a stepwise guest-guest ion-exchange method. -- PMID:31475700
