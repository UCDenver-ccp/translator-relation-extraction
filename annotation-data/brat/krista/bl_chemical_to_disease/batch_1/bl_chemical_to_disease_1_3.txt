Toosendanin alleviates dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis by inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization and regulating NLRP3 inflammasome and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. -- PMID:31520988
We provide further evidence that CVI can help differentiate DLB from AD, and we suggest that CVI may be an indicator of cognitive decline and disease progression in DLB. -- PMID:31683482
Circ-CDYL (chromodomain Y like) is specifically up-regulated in the early stages of HCC and therefore contributes to the properties of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM)-positive liver tumor-initiating cells. -- PMID:31148183
