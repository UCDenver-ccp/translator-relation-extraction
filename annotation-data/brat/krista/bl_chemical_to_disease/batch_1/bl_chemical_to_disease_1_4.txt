Higher increases in productivity were predicted for the Cu nanowire felt based on the mass-transport-limited current, but Cu ion reduction became charge transfer-limited on Cu nanowire felt at high concentrations and flow rates when the mass-transport-limited current became comparable to the charge transfer-limited current. -- PMID:31084021
Here we showed that the activation of ER stress was accompanied by elevation of G0S2 expression in the occurrence of fatty liver disease. -- PMID:31271806
Body length, body weight, condition factor, specific growth rate, and survival rate were all lower in group A compared with the other groups, but there was no significant difference in any of the parameters between groups B and C. The accumulation of microplastics was similar in groups A and B, and the accumulation of heavy metals was similar in groups B and C. -- PMID:31450030
Cobalt(II) Diphenylazodioxide Complexes Induce Apoptosis in SK-HEP-1 Cells. -- PMID:31528804
In this large prospective cohort analysis, higher serum retinol was associated with increased risk of prostate cancer and lower risk of liver and lung cancers. -- PMID:31612201
Future research should investigate the potential of carnitine in prevention/treatment of type 2 diabetes. -- PMID:31676389
Patients receiving propofol had 10.4 times the risk of cardiopulmonary arrest or dying during hospitalization compared with patients receiving fentanyl and/or midazolam (95% confidence interval, 2.9-37.3, -- PMID:31587943
Silver nanoparticle (nAg), which is one of the most common manufactured nanomaterials, has a wide range of biomedical applications. -- PMID:31113937
Blood samples were collected weekly, and milk samples were obtained on days 3, 10 and 17 of lactation. -- PMID:31368423
The course of multiple myeloma (MM) from initial diagnosis to a relapsed/refractory state is characterized by acquisition of drug resistance as well as progressive immunologic dysfunction. -- PMID:31808859
Furthermore, the liposome-based system we commenced would dramatically enhance therapeutic effects of imperialine while exhibiting extremely low side effects both on cellular and in NSCLC model. -- PMID:31605736
Herein, we report a pH and thermal dual-sensitive bovine lactoferricin-loaded (one of the most widely studied cationic anticancer peptides) nanoparticles, which simultaneously exhibited antitumor and immune cell activated effects when applied with microwave thermotherapy, an auxiliary method of immunotherapy. -- PMID:31286769
Leucine aminopeptidase (FhLAP) and cathepsin L1 (FhCL1) of Fasciola hepatica play a critical role in parasite feeding, migration through host tissue, and immune evasion. -- PMID:31036453
Pituitary stalk interruption syndrome is a congenital disease with isolated growth hormone deficiency or multiple anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies. -- PMID:31756884
Despite these significant changes, dietary nitrate supplementation had no effect on any measured read-outs of sublingual or forearm blood flow, even when environmental hypoxia was experimentally reversed using supplemental oxygen. -- PMID:31604146
Thus, this work provides strong support for the development of combinatorial therapies involving anti-CTLA-4 blockade and ICOS agonist tumor-targeting agents. -- PMID:31405808
A neglected case of congenital glaucoma can lead to lens subluxation along with lens coloboma. -- PMID:31135584
Postoperative progression of hyperextension of the first CMC joint was significantly reduced in the ECRL group. -- PMID:31438793
Liver cirrhosis nodules mostly showed a mixture of strong and weak echoes (79.60%; 7637/9595) without blood flow signal within or around the nodule; an increased volume of the nodule accompanied by heterogeneous echoes within the nodule indicated an increased probability of malignant lesion. -- PMID:31801719
We then established protein-protein interaction networks of the overlapped targets and isolated the hub genes by 11 algorithms based on the topological structure of the networks, including Sdc4, Vegfa, and Cp in the Cortex-Adult subgroup, Gria1 in the Cortex-Juvenile subgroup, and Kdr, S1pr1, Ubc, Grm2, Grin2b, Nrxn1, Pdyn, Grin3a, Itgam, Grin2a, Gabra2, and Camk4 in the Hippocampus-Adult subgroup, many of which have been associated with ASD in previous studies. -- PMID:31743624
