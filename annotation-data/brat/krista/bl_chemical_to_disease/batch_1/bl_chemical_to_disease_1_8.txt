The mRNA expression-to-secretion correlation (SeCEP) pinpointed multiple genes that are fully translated into the oncogenically active secretome in a PAM50-subtypic manner. -- PMID:31146747
In drug-induced PLG specifically, withdrawal of the immunosuppressive agent can lead to disease regression. -- PMID:31423951
High NCAPG expression is a novel prognostic biomarker to predict HCC early recurrence after surgical resection. -- PMID:31022357
Placental expressions and serum levels of adiponectin, visfatin, and omentin in GDM. -- PMID:31076892
As it is difficult to diagnose the early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma using the existing approaches, better biomarkers are urgently needed and may improve the patients' prognoses. -- PMID:31598147
Somatostatin is a neuropeptide thought to play a role in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, and is important for healthy aging and behavioral resiliency. -- PMID:31487544
In addition, the skin sensitization acceptable exposure level (AEL)/CEL was calculated as 0.00538 for all representative cosmetics and 2.14225 for rinse-off products; thus, CMIT/MIT was considered a skin sensitizer when all representative cosmetics were evaluated. -- PMID:31015893
This was supported by the observation that cleavage of a peptide bond between IPS-1 CARD and AD by Tobacco Etch virus (TEV) protease relieved autoinhibition. -- PMID:31395337
The most common prophylactic agent used was rivaroxaban (40.6%), followed by warfarin (28.5%) and aspirin (27.6%). -- PMID:31505013
Currently, PSA is the only PCa biomarker applied clinically, but it does not perform well in the early diagnosis and distinguishing between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. -- PMID:31421692
The silver-nanowire composite morphology and network structure was investigated by electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, profilometry, ellipsometry as well as surface sensitive X-ray scattering. -- PMID:31015552
These results suggest that clinically asymptomatic HHIs may affect brain reflex pathways, reflecting a biological injury previously seen when more invasive methods were applied. -- PMID:31770721
Bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation secondary to thyroid carcinoma. -- PMID:31755473
Although cisplatin (CDDP) has been used as a major chemotherapeutic drug for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), its impact on T-cell functions is controversial. -- PMID:31771883
The density of the materials with nanoparticles was higher than for the materials with microparticles with the same fractions of particles. -- PMID:31359439
Negative correlations were also found between serum FGF21 concentrations and GFR in patients after Tx, while positive correlations were observed between FGF21 concentrations and lean body mass in the CKD group, body mass index and total cholesterol in the HD group. -- PMID:31614355
In addition, the identified cooperative driver pathways are related with the target cancer, and they are involved with carcinogenesis and several key biological processes. -- PMID:31581094
Moreover, our results provide quantitative evidence of what was up to now only partially assumed with empirical support: interventions combining gametocytemia reduction through the use of gametocidal drugs, with the selective action of ivermectin during parasite development in the mosquito, may actively promote disease eradication in the long run. -- PMID:31568789
In analysis of the main effects of each single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs), variants in CLOCK rs11133373 was associated with breast cancer risk even after false discovery rate (FDR) correction (Odd Ratios (OR) = 1.38 (95% Confident Interval (CI) 1.14-1.69) in CG and CC compared to GG genotype. -- PMID:31358835
Cr-EDTA (R = 0.241; p = 0.016) and all biases except the bias of CKD-EPI CysC. -- PMID:31587755
