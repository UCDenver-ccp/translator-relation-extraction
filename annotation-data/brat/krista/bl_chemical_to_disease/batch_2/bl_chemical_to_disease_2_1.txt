Decisions regarding whether to use chemohormonal therapy or abiraterone and ADT for men with mHSPC should integrate consideration of volume of disease burden, quality of life effects, duration of therapy, and patient preferences for treatment as there is no formally powered prospective head-to-head comparison of these options demonstrating superiority of one approach over the other. -- PMID:31286275
Fifteen weeks antepartum, 38 multiparous Holstein cows were allocated to either a high body condition group (HBCS; n = 19) or a normal body condition group (NBCS; n = 19) and were fed different diets until dry-off (d -49 relative to calving) to amplify the difference. -- PMID:31587900
In the current context of emerging drug resistance, most studies have focused on Candida albicans, Candida glabrata or Candida auris but, so far, less is known about the underlying mechanisms of resistance in other species, including Candida orthopsilosis. -- PMID:31106355
Changes in fat free mass, functional exercise capacity and in symptoms of anxiety and depression correlated weakly to changes in health status measured with all questionnaires. -- PMID:31103027

Consecutive 661 non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients treated with rivaroxaban between 2012 and 2017 were recruited. -- PMID:31222552
activation of NK cells restored tumor trafficking and reactivity, hence provided a therapeutic modality while their fold expansion could be a potentially significant prognostic indicator of OS and DFS in such patients. -- PMID:31024520
It also significantly decreased the tumor infiltration area and blood vessel density, and increased the percentages of cells with nucleus deformation and cells with condensed chromatin in tumor tissues. -- PMID:31749347

Our findings suggest that higher serum copper and lower serum zinc levels may contribute to neuronal impairment by affecting neuronal biochemical metabolite ratios in the right PFC and right LN of MDD patients. -- PMID:31778759
However, boron-containing drugs such as l-boronophenylalanine (BPA) and sodium borocaptate have low boron content and/or poor tumor-targeting ability, limiting their application. -- PMID:31763850
