A total of 14 patients without anaemia, normal or slight microcytosis and hypochromia (medium concentration haemoglobin [MCH] <27 pg) were studied. -- PMID:31434698
Receiver operating characteristic curve revealed that a cut-off value of adiponectin of 9.10 μg/ml in the first trimester was associated with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 95.6% in predicting GDM. -- PMID:31803593
RORγ antagonists cause tumor regression in patient-derived xenografts and immune-intact models. -- PMID:31604910
Pretreatment characterization of urinary peptides can provide insight into early RCC progression and may aid clinical decision-making and improve disease management. -- PMID:31761032
This, in turn, designates the maximum likelihood for water droplets to be captured in the boundary layer developing over the beetle and subsequently hit the surface where they get captured. -- PMID:31466234
On univariate analysis sexual function showed a correlation with marital satisfaction (r = .34, P < .001), dose of steroids(r = -.26, P = .008), disease activity (r = -.21, P = .027), depression (r = -.19, P = .039) and anxiety (r = -.201, P = .034). -- PMID:31424179
Proteogenomic studies of cancer samples have shown that copy-number variation can be attenuated at the protein level for a large fraction of the proteome, likely due to the degradation of unassembled protein complex subunits. -- PMID:31239291
No previous meta-analyses have compared the efficacy and safety of BPA with riociguat therapy in inoperable CTEPH patients. -- PMID:31188483
MicroRNA-126: a promising biomarker for angiogenesis of diabetic wounds treated with negative pressure wound therapy. -- PMID:31564936
Anti-phospholipid antibody prevalence and association with subclinical atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis in the general population. -- PMID:31757648
There was a negative correlation between uterine tissue magnesium levels and VEGF, SOD, GPx, and MDA levels. -- PMID:31701462
We chose the 3-month mice to establish intervertebral disc degeneration model and study the effect of SIRT3 on the intervertebral disc by Western blotting, quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemistry. Mouse nucleus pulposus cells were cultured to study the exact mechanism. -- PMID:31773668
The current study examined the impact of in utero exposure to maternal tobacco smoke on the cord blood [Formula: see text] DNA methylome. -- PMID:31039056
Leptospirosis is a rare, typically tropical disease associated with water sources infected with rat urine. -- PMID:31517138
The results show that AKJ prevents weight gain, lowered fat accumulation, blood glucose, serum lipid levels, hepatic steatosis, and modulates the level of expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism in mice with obesity. -- PMID:31175701
In addition, SPM levels can be affected by dietary polyphenol or protein consumption and by various medications and diseases. -- PMID:31197432
To get a detailed insight into the electrochemical properties of the novel material in the respective battery systems, electrodes from the nanostructured SiOC were studied in half-cells with galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements. -- PMID:31100971
Cannabidiol treatment did not prevent the onset of PTSD. -- PMID:31634110
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) promotes tumor antigen-specific T cell responses and enhances the effect of immunotherapy in preclinical settings. -- PMID:31780645
A questionnaire on 6 commonly encountered clinical settings was administered: 1) the elderly; 2) the "frail" patient; 3) interactions with food/drugs; 4) low-dosages; 5) cancer patients; 6) patients with acute coronary syndrome. -- PMID:31343145
