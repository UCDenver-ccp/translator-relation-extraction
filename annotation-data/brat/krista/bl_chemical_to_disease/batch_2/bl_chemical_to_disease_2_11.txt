The persistent disease burden of psychotic disorders often comes from negative symptoms; however, prognostic biomarkers for negative symptoms have not been fully understood. -- PMID:31702384
Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirement following cardiac surgery. -- PMID:31102130
This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of psoralen in human hepatoma cell line SMMC7721 and the mechanism of antitumor effects. -- PMID:31277690
We report a remarkable improvement of the activity and stability of a Au25@ZIF-8@TiO2-ReP catalyst via composition engineering with double redox active sites of Au25 NCs and a Re(i) complex for H2 and CO evolution to promote electron utilization. -- PMID:31603164
The chemical and biological properties of MSM-rapid crossing of the blood-brain barrier, water solubility, a singlet resonance resolved from metabolite resonances, chemical shift stability with respect to pH/temperature, and stable temporal presence in the brain-lead us to propose its use as a frequency reference for MRS. -- PMID:31566256
We defined stress ulcer prophylaxis as the use of a proton-pump inhibitor, histamine-2 receptor antagonist, or sucralfate within the first 2 PICU days among children who had not been on these medications at home and had no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. -- PMID:31821206
Inflammation and oxidative stress play a key role in the pathophysiology of advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) and portal hypertension (PH). -- PMID:31623374
[Clinical randomized controlled trial on influence of recombinant human growth hormone on the immune function of younger children with severe burn injuries]. -- PMID:31658543
New therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of mucositis and its pain, based on the biological phenomena involved, must be further developed to improve the efficacy of analgesia. -- PMID:31178070
Compared to the control group, there was a high expression of microRNA-21 in hepatocellular carcinoma group. -- PMID:31554487
Treatment of NSCLC in HIV-positive patients is similar to that in HIV-negative patients, but less is known about the molecular characteristics of NSCLC in HIV-positive patients. -- PMID:31523585
However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which lycorine regulates the formation and development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain largely unknown. -- PMID:31176784
The cost derived from the medical care of PLHIV increases as the clinical control of the disease worsens, and it is a key indicator of the impact of the strategies implemented for the timely identification of the infection and subsequent management of the disease. -- PMID:31046613
On the contrary, a complete 3D tomography of the hetero-type multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) was obtained by LSFM and multi-view image fusion which revealed that the fluorescent molecule was able to reach the core of spheroids as large as 1â€¯mm in diameter. -- PMID:31228557
We then found blocking the GR signaling by adding the anti-GR agent mifepristone into the cell culture inhibited the CD44+ CSC growth while the addition of the anti-AR agent enzalutamide enhanced the CSC growth. -- PMID:31187175
In conclusion, few studies have assessed the impacts of CRD on micronutrients. -- PMID:31006978
However, whether and via which exact molecular mechanisms it ameliorates post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains unclear. -- PMID:31293390
Deregulation of cholesterol metabolism represents a hallmark of prostate cancer (PCa) and promotes its development. -- PMID:31017097
We show that extreme disorder in the bound state transforms the intrinsically disordered protein SERF1a from an RNA-organizing factor into a pathogenic enhancer of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) amyloid toxicity. -- PMID:31794729
These potential biomarkers could be used to assess overall worker health and predict the occurrence of MWCNT-induced diseases. -- PMID:31146342
