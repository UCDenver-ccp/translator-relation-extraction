We found no clear biological basis for the impaired reproductive outcomes in women with a septate uterus. -- PMID:31004459
These parts were then used to cast a urinary tract using a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based material (with 26.6 ± 4.0 kPa Young's elastic modulus). -- PMID:31049993
Occult hepatitis B virus infection (OBI) is defined as the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in serum and/or liver from HBsAg-negative subjects. -- PMID:31669141
β2 microglobulin and lactate dehydrogenase are indices of different features of Mycoplasma pneumoniae-associated community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection for severity evaluation in children. -- PMID:31227380
Nephrosis is disease characterized by abnormal protein loss from impaired kidney. -- PMID:31438249
Thus, selection for high aerobic-exercise performance resulted in a paradoxical decrease in traits positively associated with oxygen-carrying capacity per unit of blood volume, and the effect was sex-dependent. -- PMID:31004810
The identification of preventive interventions that are safe and effective for cisplatin-induced ototoxicity is important, especially in children because hearing loss can impair speech-language acquisition development. -- PMID:31160205
The method is based on the detection of small-angle X-ray scattering, which occurs e.g. at air-tissue-interfaces in the lung or bone-fat interfaces in spongy bone. -- PMID:31213645
In this review, we describe the potential interactions between abiraterone and various anticoagulants and provide management strategies based on the most recent literature for atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism and mechanical heart valves to avoid potential drug-drug interactions. -- PMID:31073853
In the current study we aimed to interrogate potential mechanisms by which cardiac mesenchymal stromal cell (CMC)-derived EVs contribute to the CMC pro-angiogenic paracrine signaling capacity in vitro. -- PMID:31102187
Parapharyngeal fat pad area at the subglosso-supraglottic level is associated with corresponding lateral wall collapse and apnea-hypopnea index in patients with obstructive sleep apnea: a pilot study. -- PMID:31776365
Emotional distress is common among illicit drug users, and it can negatively affect treatment outcomes and increase the risk of relapse. -- PMID:31533766
The OCTOFA (Atrial Fibrillation in Octogenarians) Study assessed the anticoagulant prescribing habits of cardiologists in France. -- PMID:31183629
Methotrexate Restores CD73 Expression on Th1.17 in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis Patients and May Contribute to Its Anti-Inflammatory Effect through Ado Production. -- PMID:31684171
Role of Bioactive Sphingolipids in Inflammation and Eye Diseases. -- PMID:31562629
Continuing loss of structural integrity in some tracts may contribute to the persistent post-concussion syndromes in mTBI patients, suggesting certain tracts providing an objective biomarker for tracking the pathological recovery process following mTBI. -- PMID:31133818
We investigated napsin A levels through immunohistochemistry on whole sections of 210 primary thyroid tumors of various subtypes and another 41 metastatic thyroid carcinomas, and compared these with 125 primary and 25 metastatic lung adenocarcinomas. -- PMID:31788765
Fluid intake, urine output and temperature were significantly higher in patients with polyuria, but there were no statistical differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum electrolytes, urea and creatinine. -- PMID:31423144
We concluded from our study, that low concentration of aspirin oral preparations are highly active in reducing the inflammatory biomarkers associated with periodontal diseases. -- PMID:31813866
In the BMP9/10-immunoblocked (BMP9/10ib) neonatal mouse model of HHT, we report here that the mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus, and the receptor tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, nintedanib, could synergistically fully block, but also reversed, retinal AVMs to avert retinal bleeding and anemia. -- PMID:31689244
