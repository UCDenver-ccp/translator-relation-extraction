The government management in the EU and non-EU countries should be strengthened to reduce the air pollutant and carbon dioxide emissions and raise energy transformation to the clean energy in renewable energy and improve health efficiencies in medical and health care field. -- PMID:31698803
Western blotting was performed for ALR, TGF-β receptor II (TGFβ-RII), collagen 1A1 (COLL1A1), alpha-smooth muscle cell actin (α-SMA), rac1, E-cadherin and β-actin. -- PMID:31166951
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) develops when the liver is unable to oxidize or export excess free fatty acids generated by adipose tissue lipolysis, de novo lipogenesis, or dietary intake. -- PMID:31308686
The excretion of all catecholamines was greater in men than in women (all p<0.0001). -- PMID:31174227
Logistic regression analysis showed that lower SDNN, SDANN and VLF values were risk factors for high HbA1c levels in DM patients after adjusting for gender, age and beta-blocker use in the model 1, and for gender, age, beta-blocker use, coronary artery disease and hypertension in the model 2. -- PMID:31367992
These pressure-induced environment-sensitive modifications have been rationalized by the volume effects in transforming structures, their different chemical composition, voids, ligands, and cation oxidation states switching between Fe(II), Fe(III), their high- and low-spin states, as well as solubility, molecular size, and the chemical and physical properties of the pressure transmitting media. -- PMID:31436966
The effects of the prepared masks on collagen synthesis, smoothness, and inflammation of the skin were further evaluated in vivo using two modes (mask administration interspersed with UVB exposure and mask administration after UVB exposure) of a rat model. -- PMID:31243886
This study investigated the effects of Raffia palm wine (RPW) on redox imbalance, glycolytic and cholinergic enzymes, and ATPase activities in hyperglycemia-induced oxidative testicular injury. -- PMID:31353550
Ginkgo biloba extract was previously demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory activity and had been used in prevention and therapy of some cardiovascular diseases (ie myocardial infarction), indicating Ginkgo biloba extract may be a potential drug for the treatment of VMC. -- PMID:31359441
Risk factors for third-generation cephalosporin resistance include nosocomial acquisition, recent antibiotic drug use, and hepatocellular carcinoma. -- PMID:31303428
Anthropometric data such as body mass index, mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) and blood parameters such as serum albumin, total lymphocyte count and haemoglobin were also investigated. -- PMID:31084248
In this work, we develop a theory of EVET for a nanostructure of arbitrary shape and apply it to the specific case of EVET-mediated relaxation of defect-localized excitons in a covalently functionalized CNT. -- PMID:31615218
We report stress fracture of the hamate hook in a water polo player without any specific trauma. -- PMID:31001439
Expression of ATR7-GFP fusion shows that ATR7 is a nuclear-localized protein. -- PMID:31250033
In solvent extraction, the self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules into an organized structure is the phenomenon responsible for the transfer of the metal ion from the aqueous phase to the organic solvent. -- PMID:31710459
Measures included GDM diagnosis, mental health diagnosis, psychotropic medication, body mass index, age, smoking, alcohol and illicit substance use. -- PMID:31141172
Mechanical versus biological valve prosthesis for surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with infective endocarditis. -- PMID:31121026
Decisions regarding whether and when to resume direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) after acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are challenging. -- PMID:31375402
Wild-type mice were fed an ethanol-containing or isocaloric liquid diet for 8 weeks and then assessed for liver injury (histopathology and measurement of serum enzymes), gut permeability (in vivo lactulose/mannitol and ex vivo dye leakage assays), intestinal epithelium ultrastructure (transmission electron microscopy), and intestinal occludin localization (immunofluorescence microscopy). -- PMID:31298798
The content of ABA and its catabolites was followed in the roots and needles of seedlings of Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies under conditions of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced water deficiency (-0.15 and -0.5 MPa) for 10 days. -- PMID:31091491
