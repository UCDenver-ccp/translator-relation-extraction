Cells from HESN were less susceptible to infection and expressed higher IL-21 mRNA levels than healthy controls at both baseline and 7-days post-infection; similar results were observed for IL-6, perforin, and granzyme. -- PMID:31816393
The five most common adverse events (dissociation, nausea, vertigo, dysgeusia, and dizziness) all were observed more frequently in the esketamine plus antidepressant arm than in the antidepressant plus placebo arm; 7% and 0.9% of patients in the respective treatment groups discontinued study drug because of an adverse event. -- PMID:31109201
A third of cases of leukocytoclastic vasculitis are due to drug hypersensitivity which being a diagnosis of exclusion with varying manifestations, requires a high index of clinical suspicion. -- PMID:31375992
Heme-Pigment Induced Acute Kidney Injury after Cavernous Hemangioma Ablation. -- PMID:31435136
The analysis estimates that improving hydration throughout life may greatly decrease the prevalence of degenerative diseases, with the most profound effect on dementia, heart failure (HF), and chronic lung disease (CLD), translating to the development of these diseases in 3 million fewer people in the United States alone. -- PMID:31484829
Cross-platform analyses using cancer databases (the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program database and the National Cancer Data Base) and a molecular database (The Cancer Genome Ancestry Atlas) were performed to evaluate clinical and epigenetic molecular differences between AA and EA patients based on genetic ancestry. -- PMID:31730714
/TNF-R1 Signals by AT-Lipoxin A4 May Be a Significant Mechanism of Attenuation in SAP-Associated Lung Injury. -- PMID:31097921
Significantly favorable transitions from both GG and LF ILD patterns to NL were found in patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatment for SSc-ILD, suggesting the usefulness of examining these transitions for insights into the underlying pathobiology of treatment response. -- PMID:31430058
The aim of this study was to assess the effects of oral inorganic nitrate administration in monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH. -- PMID:31429204
Comment on "Anesthetic technique and cancer outcomes: a meta-analysis of total intravenous versus volatile anesthesia". -- PMID:31161550
The rabbits were injected with type Ⅰ collagenase to prepare Achilles tendinopathy models in groups A, C, and D, and with an equal dose of normal saline in group B. The blood from the central artery of rabbit ear was taken to preprare PRP by secondary centrifugation in group D. The results of platelet counts showed that PRP platelets reached 3 to 5 times the whole blood. -- PMID:31298006
The key words used were "cerebral palsy", "brain injury", "inflammation", "oxidative stress", "cytokines", "chemokines", "neuropsychomotor development", "neurodevelopment outcomes" and "child". -- PMID:31683246
For early-stage patients, the 5 year disease-free survival rate was 52.7% compared with 32.4% in the advanced stage group (p=0.022). -- PMID:31792086
Role of Vitamin D in Patients with Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction. -- PMID:31292859
The experimental results showed that transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) increased the expression of G6PD by activating the forkhead box protein M1-high mobility group AT-hook 1-G6PD (FOXM1-HMGA1-G6PD) transcriptional regulatory pathway, in which TGFβ1 inhibited the ubiquitination and degradation of FOXM1 protein. -- PMID:31814893
Non-skull base tumor location was associated with CNS tissue on the microscopic slides (OR 1.45; p < .001), increasing specimen weight (OR 1.01; p < .001), and remaining tissue not subjected to neuropathological analyses (OR 2.18; p < .001) but not with BI (OR 1.29; p = .199). -- PMID:31161444
Fluorine content in serum of women with PCOS did not statistically significantly differ from that of the control group and amounted to 0.224 ± 0.043 and 0.228 ± 0.023 ppm, respectively. -- PMID:31203910
This review will summarize the current knowledge of the clinical, biochemical, molecular and histological profile of atypical parathyroid adenomas. -- PMID:31085770
Of the 73 participants, 56.2% were classified as diffuse SSc and 26% limited SSc. -- PMID:31498073
Liver transplantation is a curative treatment option for alcoholic cirrhosis and AH, but patients must abstain from alcohol use for 6 months to qualify. -- PMID:31214376
