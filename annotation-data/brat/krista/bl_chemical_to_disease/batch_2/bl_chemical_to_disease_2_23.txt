Silencing of IDH2 in prostate cancer cells impaired oxidative bioenergetics, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and promoted exaggerated mitochondrial dynamics. -- PMID:31530011
The key findings in the VP-VLBW neonates were: (a) 37% of the VP-VLBW neonates had ultrasound brain abnormalities; (b) gestational age and birth weight collectively with hospital course (i.e., days in hospital, neonatal intensive care, mechanical ventilation and with oxygen therapy, surgeries, and retinopathy of prematurity) predicted ultrasound brain abnormalities. -- PMID:31551853
This commentary asks another question, one only more recently addressed namely, what is the physiologic function of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and of its secretase-generated soluble species? -- PMID:31578640
DβH protein, which is found in circulation, can, therefore, be evaluated as a marker of norepinephrine function in a plethora of different disorders and diseases. -- PMID:31613389
Since the proton minibeams widen with depth, the homogeneous irradiation of a tumor can be ensured by adjusting the beam distances to tumor size and depth to maintain tumor control as in conventional proton therapy. -- PMID:31765436
Especially, the high-grade stage II CRAC patients are recommended to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. -- PMID:31595030
