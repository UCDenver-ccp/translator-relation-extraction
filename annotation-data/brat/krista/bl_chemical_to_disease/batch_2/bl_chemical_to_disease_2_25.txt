As a prerequisite for stable fed-batch operation, a constant pH is maintained by automated addition of ammonium hydroxide. -- PMID:31399865
In this article, we discuss the phenotype resulting from the interaction of Hb Peterborough and Hb LBW and emphasize the importance of molecular testing in the diagnosis of rare Hb variants. -- PMID:31060398
Meanwhile, a series of biological evaluations demonstrated that the HMSNs-PDA-PEG@QD exhibited remarkable ability to overcome MDR compared with free DOX and HMSNs-PDA-PEG@DOX. -- PMID:31408782
A suitable biomarker should allow predicting the severity of the infection in a simple and opportune manner and should ideally be obtained from non-invasive samples. -- PMID:31214165
