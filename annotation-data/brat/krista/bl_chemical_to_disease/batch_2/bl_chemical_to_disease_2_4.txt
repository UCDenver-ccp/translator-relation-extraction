Ductal tree ablation by local delivery of ethanol prevents tumor formation in an aggressive mouse model of breast cancer. -- PMID:31779648
Chronic and acute complications may be encountered in patients with classical homocystinuria and plasma methionine concentrations pose an additional risk factor. -- PMID:31240166
The molecules currently investigated in the field of cancer and coagulation are heparin mimetics and inhibitors of heparanase derived from TF pathway inhibitor 2. Both groups of molecules are inhibitors of heparanase and in addition pose a low bleeding tendency. -- PMID:31398734
The mRNA expression of CR-1 in PCa tissue and cells was also significantly higher than in BPH tissue and the normal RWPE-1 prostate cell line (P<0.05). -- PMID:31452743
ALOX12-12-HETE-GPR31 played an important role in HCC recurrence and might be a potential therapeutic target to reduce HCC recurrence after surgery in fatty livers. -- PMID:31831037
Coordination complexes have emerged as prominent modulators of amyloid aggregation via their interaction with the N-terminal histidine residues of amyloid-β (Aβ). -- PMID:31573804
In this review, we summarize the involvement of altered glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolic enzyme expression and the underlying molecular mechanisms in EMT induction in tumor cells. -- PMID:31027222
Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial of Galantamine for Methadone-Maintained Individuals With Cocaine Use Disorder: Secondary Analysis of Effects on Illicit Opioid Use. -- PMID:31165574
Whereas glucose control using classical glucose-lowering agents (except perhaps metformin) largely fails to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD), two new pharmacological classes, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), have proven their ability to reduce major cardiovascular events in patients with established CVD. -- PMID:31108136
Considering the qualities of all the polymers desired to be used as scaffolds, Polycaprolactone (PCL) polyester apart from being biocompatible and biodegradable qualifies to an appreciable level due its easy availability, cost efficacy and suitability for modification. -- PMID:31754598
Changes in the monoaminergic mechanisms in the brain at different terms after status epilepticus are determined by diverse causes and depend on the role of monoamines in the implementation of specific postictal rearrangements in CNS. -- PMID:31177463
For disease-free survival (DFS), the HR for the RCT group was 0.83 (95% CI 0.65-1.07), -- PMID:31639018
Reply to: "Thiazides and nonmelanoma skin cancer: Is it a class effect?" -- PMID:31520664
Normalization of CPP and limitation of cerebral autoregulation impairment is a key therapeutic goal. -- PMID:31115824
Undifferentiated dental papilla cells and preodontoblasts (preOB) showed intense IGF-I- and IGF-IRα-positive reactions, and the expression was observed in differentiated odontoblasts, such as immature odontoblasts (iOB) and mature odontoblasts (mOB). -- PMID:31400542
Specifically, the spatial-resolved dual-disk glassy carbon electrodes were modified with CdS nanowires (CdS NWs) and luminol-gold nanoparticles (L-Au NPs) as potential-resolved ECL emitters, respectively. -- PMID:31742265
Poly-Arginine Peptide-18 (R18) Reduces Brain Injury and Improves Functional Outcomes in a Nonhuman Primate Stroke Model. -- PMID:31833045
The results suggest that lead absorption is highly influenced due to zinc levels in body which has an impact over DNA damage, blood cell aberration and oxidative stress caused by lead exposure. -- PMID:31583521
With increasing blood pressure during heat waves, it is recommended to give preference to calcium channel antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and selective beta-blockers. -- PMID:31090380
The aim of this study was to assess the relation of lipid peroxidation and interleukin-6 with carotid atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes mellitus. -- PMID:31646300
