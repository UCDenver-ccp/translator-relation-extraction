Mice, in different states of satiety (fed/fasted, or fed/fasted and treated with ghrelin or leptin, respectively), were allowed to choose between high-fat/high-sucrose and standard foods. -- PMID:31310704
Challenges in the Pap diagnosis of endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ. -- PMID:31097290
Lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) is a risk factor for atherosclerosis but its role in IRD with accompanying coronary artery disease (CAD) is still unclear. -- PMID:31079089
Identification of ATP synthase α subunit as a new maternal factor capable of protecting zebrafish embryos from bacterial infection. -- PMID:31518507
SAC promoted p38MAPK activity responsible for p53 phosphorylation, its stabilization followed by nuclear translocation leading to induction in expression and oligomerization of Fas protein. -- PMID:31067004
ion and the L44-L53 loop responsible for substrate discrimination. -- PMID:31396843
Compounds 4a, 6b, 7a, 7b, 8b, and 9b showed maximum fall in the blood glucose levels in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats after 5-7 days of administration. -- PMID:31696542
One major hypothesis purports that neurons homeostatically regulate their ongoing activity through mechanisms that link membrane voltage to expression relationships among ion channels [6-10]. -- PMID:31080077
Seated saline infusion test in predicting subtype diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. -- PMID:31618467
Home telemonitoring for patients with cancer significantly increases registration of pain and prescriptions of analgesics in outpatient medical records. -- PMID:31419371
Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is an important chaperone in lung adenocarcinoma, with relevant protein drivers such as EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and EML4-ALK (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like protein4 fused to anaplastic lymphoma kinase) depending on it for their correct function, therefore HSP90 inhibitors show promise as potential treatments for lung adenocarcinoma. -- PMID:31370342
Evaluation of diabetes mellitus regulation in dogs treated with ophthalmic preparations of prednisolone acetate versus diclofenac sodium. -- PMID:31763946
In vitro, lnc‑PKD2‑2‑3 increased CD44, CD133 and OCT4 expression as well as the CD44+CD133+ cell proportion, raised the sphere formation efficiency and enhanced drug resistance to 5‑FU in TFK‑1 and Huh‑28 cells. -- PMID:31059014
We present a model which attempts to explain how, in the absence of cells in the primary stroma, collagen organisation might be influenced by cell-independent, intrinsic mechanisms, such as fibril axial charge derived from associated proteoglycans. -- PMID:31445001
