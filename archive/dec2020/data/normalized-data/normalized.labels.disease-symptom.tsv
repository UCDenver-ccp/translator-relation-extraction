Woodhouse-Sakati Syndrome: First report of a Portuguese case.tWoodhouse-Sakati Syndrome is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the DCAF17 gene, which encodes DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor 17. It is a multisystemic disorder characterized by hypogonadism, adolescent- to young adult-onset diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and alopecia. Neurologic involvement includes childhood-onset moderate bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, mild intellectual disability adolescent- to young adult-onset of extrapyramidal findings, dysarthria, and dysphagia. Brain imaging typically reveals iron deposition in the globus pallidus and periventricular leukodystrophy. We report the case of a 31-year-old Portuguese female, the only child of a consanguineous couple. She presented with cognitive impairment, spastic paraparesis, lower limb dystonia, dysarthria, and dysphagia. She also had hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism associated with primary amenorrhea, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with retinopathy, primary hypothyroidism, moderate bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and alopecia. Serial brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a progressive periventricular leukodystrophy with pontine involvement and significant bilateral iron deposition in the globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and red nucleus. The diagnosis of Woodhouse-Sakati Syndrome was eventually proposed and DCAF17 gene sequencing identified a novel likely pathogenic homozygous variant NG_013038.1(NM_025000.3):c.1091+2T>C. Genetic testing allowed a more accurate prognosis and a precise genetic counseling for our patient's family.

Determining the current indications for endoscopic submucosal dissection in patients with Lauren mixed-type early gastric cancer.tRecent study showed that early gastric cancer (EGC) with Lauren mixed-type (MT) histology is associated with worse prognosis. We aimed to evaluate the clinicopathologic features and prognostic significance of Lauren MT-EGCs that meets the criteria for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).||||We reviewed 2665 patients with EGC who underwent surgery between 2010 and 2015. The clinicopathologic features and invasiveness including lymph node metastasis (LNM) and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) of MT-EGC were compared with those of intestinal type and diffuse type by Lauren histology.||||Among 2665 patients, EGCs in 241 (9%) patients were classified as MT. Tumor size was larger and depth of invasion was greater than other histology. Among patients with MT-EGC, 16.6% (40/241) showed LNM and 22.8% (55/241) showed lymphatic invasion, which were significantly higher than that of patients with other Lauren types (8.2% and 15.3% in intestinal type and 9.1% and 8.7% in diffuse type, P < 0.001). This finding remained significant even after adjusting for depth of invasion. However, when we analyzed the patient groups who met the absolute or expanded criteria of ESD, no significant difference was observed in the rates of LNM or LVI or cancer mortality by Lauren classification.||||Mixed-type early gastric cancer (MT-EGC) exhibited larger tumor size, greater depth of invasion, and higher risk of LNM and LVI.

Sensitive skin is a neuropathic disorder.tSensitive skin is defined by the occurrence of unpleasant sensations such as tingling, burning, tautness, itching or pain. Mechanisms explaining sensitive skin are controversial, and many hypotheses have been proposed. Because sensitive skin is primarily characterized by a wide variety of neuropathic-like symptoms, it is highly likely that neurosensory dysfunction in the skin represents one of the pathological mechanisms of sensitive skin. This hypothesis does not exclude other explanations like role of keratinocyte, transient receptor potential channels, vasculature or environmental factors. Nevertheless, the role of the nervous system in the development of sensitive skin is crucial, and growing evidence supports this hypothesis. Pain and pruritus described by patients with sensitive skin correspond to neuropathic component, and its assessment shows an increase in neuropathic measures (DN-4, Douleur Neuropathique 4) compared with control. These sensations are similar to the sensations observed in small-fibre neuropathy (SFN), which is a group of disorders that affect thin nerve fibres. One study on the pathophysiology of sensitive skin demonstrated that intra-epidermal nerve fibre density, especially of peptidergic C-fibres, was lower in the sensitive skin group. A recent study showed a modification in heat-pain detection threshold in patients with sensitive skin. All these results indicate that C-fibre damage can help explain sensitive skin. Consequently, the role of the nervous system is increasingly obvious. Nevertheless, keratinocytes and other epidermal cells closely participate in sensory transduction. Therefore, the results of neurophysiological studies should be interpreted in the light of this information that the whole epidermis represents a huge polymodal nociceptor.

Long non‑coding RNA MEG‑3 suppresses gastric carcinoma cell growth, invasion and migration via EMT regulation.tGastric carcinoma is one of the most frequently diagnosed gastrointestinal tumors. Long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are broadly defined as endogenous cellular non‑coding RNA molecules. Studies have demonstrated that they may be associated with human cancer progression. In the present study, the role of lncRNA‑maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in the progression of gastric carcinoma cells was investigated in vitro and in vivo. It was demonstrated that lncRNA‑MEG3 expression was downregulated in gastric carcinoma cells compared with normal gastric cells. lncRNA‑MEG3 transfection increased E‑cadherin expression and markedly inhibited gastric carcinoma cell growth, migration and invasion. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that lncRNA‑MEG3 transfection promoted the apoptosis of gastric carcinoma cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that lncRNA‑MEG3 transfection inhibited the expression of anti‑apoptotic proteins B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl‑2) and Bcl‑2‑like protein 2 and increased the expression of pro‑-apoptotic proteins caspase‑3 and caspase‑9 in gastric carcinoma cells. lncRNA‑MEG3 transfection upregulated the expression of epithelial marker E‑cadherin and inhibited the expression of mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin in gastric carcinoma cells, which suggested that lncRNA‑MEG3 inhibited epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), which may subsequently inhibit progression in gastric carcinoma cells. The present study also revealed that lncRNA‑MEG3 transfection suppressed tumor growth mainly by decreasing the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and increasing the expression of Bcl‑2 in vivo. In conclusion, these results indicated that lncRNA‑MEG3 may regulate EMT‑associated signaling pathways and has the potential as a therapeutic target in gastric carcinoma.

The aim of this study was to validate these criteria and analyse the outcomes in function of the surgical procedure and IPMN subtype.||||Clinical, radiological and surgical data (procedure, morbidity/mortality rates) of patients who underwent surgery for IPMN between 2007 and 2017. The predictive value of the different criteria was analysed.||||124 patients (men 67%; mean age 65 years) underwent surgery for IPMN (n = 62 malignant tumours; 50%). Jaundice, cyst ≥4 cm and Wirsung duct size 5-9.9 mm or ≥ 10 mm were significantly associated with malignancy (4.77 < OR < 11.85 p < 0.0001). The positive predictive value of any isolated criterion ranged from 71 to 87%, whereas that of three relative criteria together reached 100%. The mortality and morbidity (grade III-IV complications according to the Dindo-Clavien classification) rates were 3 and 8%, respectively. Morbidity/mortality after duodenopancreatectomy and total pancreatectomy were significantly higher for benign IPMN (p = 0.01).||||Considering the morbidity associated with extended surgery, particularly for benign IPMN, the results of the present study suggest that high-risk surgery should be considered only in the presence of three relative criteria and including the surgery type in the decision-making algorithm.

[Association between admission diagnosis and immunotherapy outcome in patients with autoimmune epilepsy].tTo evaluate the impact of admission diagnosis on seizure outcome in patients with autoimmune epilepsy (AE).  Methods: We conducted a retrospective study on 40 AE patients at Department of Neurology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University from Jan. 1st, 2017 to Nov. 21st, 2018. According to their admission diagnosis, these patients were further assigned into 2 groups: An AE diagnosed group and an AE undiagnosed group. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), electroencephalogram, and brain imaging were compared between the 2 groups. Favorable seizure outcome was defined as >50% reduction of seizure frequency at the first follow-up. The impact of admission diagnosis on seizure outcome of AE patients was analyzed.  Results: The ages of 40 AE patients were (33.23±16.41) years, comprising 19 males and 21 females. No significant difference was found between the AE diagnosed group and the AE undiagnosed group in gender, age, central nervous system-specific Ab profile, CSF, and brain imaging. Duration of symptom onset to Ab detection was significantly longer in the AE undiagnosed group than that in the AE diagnosed group (P<0.01). Duration of symptom onset to immunotherapy was also significantly longer in the AE undiagnosed group than that in the AE diagnosed group (P<0.001). There were more patients with favorable seizure outcome in the AE diagnosed group than the AE undiagnosed group (P<0.05).  Conclusion: Admission diagnosis for patients with AE is associated with seizure outcome after immunotherapy. For adult-onset epilepsy or epilepsy with unknown etiology, the diagnosis of AE should be considered. Early diagnosis of AE and prompt initiation of immunosuppressive treatment are crucial to increase the likelihood of achieving favorable seizure outcome.

Implications of exosomes as diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in cancer.tExosomes offer a new perspective on the biology of cancer with both diagnostic and therapeutic concepts. Due to the cell-to-cell association, exosomes are involved in the progression, metastasis, and therapeutic efficacy of the tumor. They can be isolated from blood and other body fluids to determine the disease progression in the body, including cancer growth. In addition to being reservoirs of biochemical markers of cancer, exomes can be designed to restore tumor immunity. Tumor exosomes interact with different cells in the tumor microenvironment to confer beneficial modulations, responsible for stromal activity, angiogenesis, increased vascular permeability, and immune evasion. Exosomes also contribute to the metastasis with the aim of epithelial transmission to the mesenchyme and the formation of premetastatic niches. Moreover, exosomes protect cells against the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs and prevent the transmission of chemotherapy resistance to adjacent cells. Therefore, exosomes are essential for many fatal cancer agents, and understanding their origins and role in cancer is important. In this article, we attempted to clarify the potential of exosomes for the application in cancer diagnosis and therapy.

[Confocal laser endomicroscopy for the treatment of upper urinary tract transitional cellcarcinoma.]tConfocal lasser endomicroscopy (CLE) is an optical technique that enables in vivo cytological characterization of a tissue. Previous studies have shown it useful in the evaluation of urinary and respiratory tracts for a better characterization of mucosal lesions, showing a high concordance between in vivo and final histopathological results. Recently, the use of CLE has been proposed for the study of transitional cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract (UUT) during ureteroscopy, because it enables real time information about tumor grade and supplements the information of ureteroscopic biopsies, which may understimate the grade and stage of the lesion up to 43% of the cases due to its limitiations.||||We performed a systematic review of the literature in the Pubmed/Medline database following the PRISMA standard. We selected 20 articles that complied with the inclusion criteria for evidence synthesis. RESULTS: Equipment miniaturization has enabled CLE as part of the diagnostic options in upper urinary tract tumors. This technique performs in vivo cytological characterization of the evaluated tissue, accomplishing differentiation between tumor and normal tissue, as well as tumor grade identification. Its communicated sensitivity and specificity reach 79%/78% respectively for low grade tumors and 67%/79% for high grade, with a substantial inter observer concordance (surgeon/pathologist; k = 0.64). No complications have been communicated in the literature with the use of fluorescein or confocal laser microscopy probes in patients undergoing this technique.||||CLE represents a useful and safe tool, capable of providing cytological real time information of UUT tumors that enables tumor grade identification with substantial concordance between in vivo tumor typifying and the final histopathological analysis. For this, CLE is currently considered a tool for conservative management of UUT transitional cell carcinoma in the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines.

Sugar reduction in bakery products: Current strategies and sourdough technology as a potential novel approach.tThe world is facing a big problem of non-communicable diseases, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. An excessive sugar consumption is considered as a main factor, which triggers these diseases. The two main sources of sugar in processed products on the market are sugar-sweetened beverages and sweet bakery products. Sugar reduction is challenging, especially in baked goods, since it interacts significantly with all ingredients. These interactions cause an increase in gelatinization temperature, a delay in gluten network development, an increase or decrease in yeast activity depending on the sugar concentration, as well as an enhancement of emulsification. Reflecting the molecular interactions on the product quality characteristics of different types of baked goods, sugar also contributes to browning reactions and extension of microbial shelf life. During cake preparation, sugar supports the batter aeration which results in the typical soft cake crumb. Furthermore, it contributes to the spreading process of biscuits during baking and enhances surface cracking due to recrystallization. Sugar reduction requires the development of different strategies; Two well-known strategies are the replacement of added sugar by the combination of bulking agents and high-intensive sweeteners, or by sweet bulking ingredients, such as polyols. The in-situ production of polyols to enhance sweetness, and exopolysaccharides to improve texture, in a sourdough system shows high potential as sugar replacement. Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc citreum are high mannitol producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains with yields of 70-98% and Leuconostoc oenos was found to produce erythritol. Furthermore, the yeast strain Candida milleri isolated from sourdough produces xylitol in the presence of xylose. Exopolysaccharides produced by LAB and/or yeasts are known to improve the texture and structure of bakery products and, thus, have high potential as natural functional ingredients to compensate quality loss in sweet bakery goods.

Each condition consisted of four short vignettes. The counterstereotypic condition provided an uncontrollable explanation of obesity (e.g., genetics) in each vignette describing a person with obesity, while the stereotypic condition emphasized lifestyle choices as the main cause of obesity. The control condition included a vignette in which weight was not addressed. Participants completed questionnaires about weight controllability and obesity bias pre- and post-exposure. There was a significant interaction between time and condition on beliefs about weight controllability and obesity bias. Participants in the counterstereotypic condition increased in belief about the uncontrollability of weight and decreased in obesity bias, while participants in the stereotypic condition decreased in belief about the uncontrollability of weight and increased in obesity bias. Obesity bias reduction strategies that utilize information about weight controllability can be effective. However, perpetuating stereotypic causes of obesity can worsen the problem.

In all, 202 articles were then selected by applying exclusion criteria. Among them, 155 were retrieved by both methods, 33 by manual search only, and 14 by BIBOT only. Reliability (κ = 0.84) was almost perfect. Further selection was performed by reading the 202 articles. Cohort sizes and the nature and prevalence of cutaneous manifestations varied across publications. In all, we found 52 cutaneous manifestations reported in primary SS patients. The most described ones were cutaneous vasculitis (561 patients), xerosis (651 patients) and annular erythema (215 patients).||||Among the final selection of 202 articles, 155/202 (77%) were found by the two methods but BIBOT was faster and automatically classified the articles in a chart. Combining the two methods retrieved the largest number of publications.

Intraosseous Tophaceous Gout in Hallux Mimicking a Bone Tumor in a Young Patient: A Case Report.tA 17-year-old man experienced night pain in his right hallux. Radiographs revealed a lytic lesion in the proximal phalanx of the right hallux. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a low-signal intensity mass on T1-weighted sequences and isointense-high-signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences. We suspected a benign bone tumor such as osteoid osteoma or a bone cyst and consequently performed biopsy and surgical treatment. The lesion was filled with a whitish chalk-like substance, and pathologic examination revealed tophaceous gout.||||It can be difficult to distinguish intraosseous tophaceous gout from other diseases, including bone tumors, using imaging; hence, pathological examination may be necessary for the diagnosis.

[Early experience with CyberKnife treatment in case of intra-, suprasellar hypernephroma metastasis].tAmong tumours found in the suprasellar region metastases are very rare and the most frequent primary tumours are lung and breast cancer. Data of a patient with clear cell renal carcinoma with intra-suprasellar metastasis will be discussed. As in most of the tumours in the sellar region, the first symptom was visual deterioration with visual field defect. A transsphenoidal debulking of the tumour was performed and the residual tumor was treated by CyberKnife hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. Both our patient's visual acuity and visual field impairment improved after the surgery and CyberKnife treatment. At 6-month after irradiation, MR of the sella showed a complete remission of the tumour. This was the first treatment with CyberKnife in our country in case of a tumour close to the optic chiasm. According to our best knowledge, there are 21 cases in the literature with renal cell carcinoma metastasis in the suprasellar region.

Midodrine treatment in a patient with treprostinil-induced hypotension receiving hemodialysis.tUse of the vasodilator midodrine for the treatment of treprostinil-induced hypotension is reported.||||Intradialytic hypotension is a common complication of dialysis that increases patient mortality due to suboptimal ultrafiltration and interruption of hemodialysis. Midodrine is an α1 vasoconstrictor commonly used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and intradialytic hypotension. The safety of midodrine dosing at greater than 30 mg daily has not been established to date. A 49-year-old African-American man with a history of PAH and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was receiving hemodialysis (HD) 3 times weekly. Subcutaneous treprostinil infusions were initiated for PAH, subsequently causing hypotension, with predialysis blood pressure values as low as 60/50 mm Hg. During a 6-month follow-up period, 38 of 62 dialysis sessions were interrupted or discontinued due to severe intradialytic hypotension. Counteraction of treprostinil effects was achieved by increasing the total daily midodrine dose from 30 mg to 90 mg over 6 months, with no remarkable adverse effects. In previously reported cases, maximum midodrine daily doses of 30 mg in nondialysis patients and 25 mg in patients with ESRD receiving hemodialysis were reported. The patient described here received a total daily dose of 90 mg, including 60 mg administered in divided doses for daily maintenance and 30-mg intradialytic doses; this was the highest daily midodrine dose reported to date.||||A 49-year-old patient tolerated 60-mg daily doses of midodrine along with 30-mg intradialytic doses for the management of treprostinil-induced hypotension and prevention of HD interruption, without adverse effects.

In HCC-experienced patients, HCC treatment modality, and the duration between HCC management and DAAs initiation were recorded. In all patients, pretreatment clinicolaboratory evaluation, and imaging before, during and after DAAs were done.||||De novo HCC occurred in 7.6% of naïve patients, while recurrence appeared in 28% of patients with previous HCC. Pretreatment alpha-fetoprotein was an independent predictor of HCC occurrence, while the time between HCC ablation and the beginning of DAAs was the only predictor of HCC recurrence (p < 0.001). Half of the patients who started DAAs before 6 months had HCC recurrence, while patients who started DAAs at ≥6 months had no recurrence (p< 0.0001).||||Although HCC occurrence after DAAs was not high, recurrence was apparently high. Pretreatment alpha-fetoprotein is a predictor for de novo HCC. The time between HCC ablation and DAAs was the strongest predictor of recurrence.

Thiemann disease and familial digital arthropathy - brachydactyly: two sides of the same coin?tFamilial digital arthropathy-brachydactyly (FDAB) and Thiemann disease are non-inflammatory digital arthropathies with many phenotypic similarities. Thirty-three cases of Thiemann disease have been described so far (Mangat et al, Ann Rheum Dis 64:11-2, 2005; Ha et al, Thiemann's disease: a case Report, 2017) but no gene variants have been identified as causative to date. FDAB is reported in only a few patients and has been associated with three heterozygous missense variants in the Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) gene. We report a TRPV4 variant in a father and son referred with a diagnosis of Thiemann disease and compare the clinical and radiological features of Thiemann disease with Familial digital arthropathy-brachydactyly (FDAB). We hypothesize that these two entities may be one and the same.||||We describe a father and son referred with a diagnosis of Thiemann disease who were subsequently identified with a heterozygous variant (c.809G > T) in TRPV4. The identical genetic variant was previously reported to cause FDAB. A PUBMED® database search was conducted to retrieve articles related to Thiemann disease and FDAB. We were able to review the clinical and radiological findings of nineteen individuals affected by Thiemann disease and compare them with three families affected by FDAB.||||Thiemann disease initially affects the proximal interphalangeal joints and primarily the middle phalangeal bases. In FDAB, the distal phalangeal joints are first affected with the middle phalangeal heads being the primary site of changes. Radial deviation has only been described in FDAB. Our analysis determined that 5 of 20 individuals affected by Thiemann disease have clinical and radiological findings that also fit well with FDAB.||||FDAB and Thiemann disease are non-inflammatory digital arthropathies with phenotypic overlap. Although more extensive joint involvement, a distal hand joint preponderance and brachydactyly are expected in FDAB, there are striking clinical and radiological similarities between the two entities. Our analysis suggests that these two phenotypes may represent phenotypic variability of the same entity. Despite many attempts to identify other reported patients affected by Thiemann disease, we were not able to procure DNA from any of the cases to verify our findings. Genetic testing of an affected individual will be crucial in order to provide accurate reproductive genetic counselling about the autosomal dominant nature of this condition.

Microparticles from tumors exposed to radiation promote immune evasion in part by PD-L1.tRadiotherapy induces immune-related responses in cancer patients by various mechanisms. Here, we investigate the immunomodulatory role of tumor-derived microparticles (TMPs)-extracellular vesicles shed from tumor cells-following radiotherapy. We demonstrate that breast carcinoma cells exposed to radiation shed TMPs containing elevated levels of immune-modulating proteins, one of which is programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). These TMPs inhibit cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity both in vitro and in vivo, and thus promote tumor growth. Evidently, adoptive transfer of CTLs pre-cultured with TMPs from irradiated breast carcinoma cells increases tumor growth rates in mice recipients in comparison with control mice receiving CTLs pre-cultured with TMPs from untreated tumor cells. In addition, blocking the PD-1-PD-L1 axis, either genetically or pharmacologically, partially alleviates TMP-mediated inhibition of CTL activity, suggesting that the immunomodulatory effects of TMPs in response to radiotherapy is mediated, in part, by PD-L1. Overall, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the tumor immune surveillance state in response to radiotherapy and suggest a therapeutic synergy between radiotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Near-infrared light and glucose dual-responsive cascading hydroxyl radical generation for in situ gelation and effective breast cancer treatment.tA general therapeutic strategy to treat breast cancer is attractive as different subtypes of breast cancers often exhibit distinct response to existing cancer therapeutics. To this end, we prepare a catalyst couple of glucose oxidase (GOx) and gallic acid-ferrous (GA-Fe) nanocomplexes, a type of near-infrared (NIR) absorbing Fenton catalyst, to enable NIR-trigger in-situ gelation and enhanced chemodynamic/starvation therapy that appears to be effective for different types of breast cancer cells. In this system, GOx is mixed with GA-Fe in a solution of N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAA) and poly (ethylene glycol) double acrylate (PEGDA). Upon intratumoral injection and NIR laser exposure, such GA-Fe show rapid temperature increase, which would simultaneously increase the catalytic efficiencies of GA-Fe and GOx. The cascade production of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) from glucose is then initiated to enable polymerization of DMAA and PEGDA to form a hydrogel at the injection site within the tumor. The continuous production of cytotoxic •OH together with glucose depletion by the intratumorally fixed catalyst couple would further confer effective destruction of breast cancer tumors by such chemodynamic/starvation therapy. Our work presents a hydrogel-based therapeutic strategy for local treatment of solid tumors with high tumor destruction efficacy and low systemic toxicity.

Combined gene essentiality scoring improves the prediction of cancer dependency maps.tProbing genetic dependencies of cancer cells can improve our understanding of tumour development and progression, as well as identify potential drug targets. CRISPR-Cas9-based and shRNA-based genetic screening are commonly utilized to identify essential genes that affect cancer growth. However, systematic methods leveraging these genetic screening techniques to derive consensus cancer dependency maps for individual cancer cell lines are lacking.||||In this work, we first explored the CRISPR-Cas9 and shRNA gene essentiality profiles in 42 cancer cell lines representing 10 cancer types. We observed limited consistency between the essentiality profiles of these two screens at the genome scale. To improve consensus on the cancer dependence map, we developed a computational model called combined essentiality score (CES) to integrate the genetic essentiality profiles from CRISPR-Cas9 and shRNA screens, while accounting for the molecular features of the genes. We found that the CES method outperformed the existing gene essentiality scoring approaches in terms of ability to detect cancer essential genes. We further demonstrated the power of the CES method in adjusting for screen-specific biases and predicting genetic dependencies in individual cancer cell lines.||||Systematic comparison of the CRISPR-Cas9 and shRNA gene essentiality profiles showed the limitation of relying on a single technique to identify cancer essential genes. The CES method provides an integrated framework to leverage both genetic screening techniques as well as molecular feature data to determine gene essentiality more accurately for cancer cells.

Ethnic disparities among men with prostate cancer undergoing germline testing.tProstate cancer is among the most heritable cancers, and clinical testing for germline genetic variants based on ethnicity, disease features, and family history has recently become standard of care for men with advanced disease. It is not established whether prevalence of germline variants varies based on ethnicity or race.||||We retrospectively examined germline genetic and clinical data of men reporting a diagnosis of prostate cancer referred to Color Genomics by a healthcare provider for testing of 30 genes associated with hereditary cancer risk. Variants were classified as pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), variant of uncertain significance (VUS), likely benign, or benign. P/LP and VUS prevalence was compared among subgroups classified by age at diagnosis, self-reported ethnicity, family history, and history of other cancer.||||We identified 1,351 men reporting a diagnosis of prostate cancer of any stage who underwent germline testing. Overall, 78% of men were Caucasian, 11% Ashkenazi Jewish, 3% African-American/Canadian (AAC), 2% Hispanic, 2% Asian/Pacific Islander (API), and 4% Other (multiple, unknown, Native-American). One-hundred eighty-seven men (13.8%) carried a P/LP variant, and the most prevalent P/LP variants were in BRCA2 (3.4%), CHEK2 (2.8%), MUTYH (1.8%), and ATM (1.7%). Age at diagnosis, ethnicity, type of family member with prostate cancer, and type of second cancer were not associated with risk of carrying any P/LP variant. Ashkenazi Jewish men (6.7%) were more likely to carry P/LP BRCA2 variants than Caucasian men (2.8%) (P < 0.05). Two-hundred eighty-four men (21.0%) carried a VUS, and AAC (36.6%) and API (33.3%) men were most likely to carry a VUS (P < 0.01).||||P/LP germline variants are prevalent in men with prostate cancer. AAC, Hispanic, and API men with prostate cancer are under-represented in studies of germline testing, potentially contributing to higher rates of VUS relative to Caucasian and Ashkenazi Jewish men. Further studies in these groups will facilitate reclassification of VUS, increasing opportunities for early detection, cancer risk modification, and targeted therapeutics.

Immunostimulatory nanomedicines synergize with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy to eradicate colorectal tumors.tNanoparticles can potentially stimulate tumour microenvironments to elicit antitumour immunity. Herein, we demonstrate effective immunotherapy of colorectal cancer via systemic delivery of an immunostimulatory chemotherapeutic combination in nanoscale coordination polymer (NCP) core-shell particles. Oxaliplatin and dihydroartemesinin have contrasting physicochemical properties but strong synergy in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and anticancer activity. The combined ROS generation is harnessed for immune activation to synergize with an anti-PD-L1 antibody for the treatment of murine colorectal cancer tumours. The favourable biodistribution and tumour uptake of NCPs and the absence of peripheral neuropathy allow for repeated dosing to afford 100% tumour eradication. The involvement of innate and adaptive immune systems elicit strong and long lasting antitumour immunity which prevents tumour formation when cured mice are challenged with cancer cells. The intrinsically biodegradable, well tolerated, and systemically available immunostimulatory NCP promises to enter clinical testing as an immunotherapy against colorectal cancer.

An In Vitro System for Evaluating Molecular Targeted Drugs Using Lung Patient-Derived Tumor Organoids.tPatient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs) represent a promising preclinical cancer model that better replicates disease, compared with traditional cell culture models. We have established PDOs from various human tumors to accurately and efficiently recapitulate the tissue architecture and function. Molecular targeted therapies with remarkable efficacy are currently in use against various tumors. Thus, there is a need for in vitro functional-potency assays that can be used to test the efficacy of molecular targeted drugs and model complex interactions between immune cells and tumor cells to evaluate the potential for cancer immunotherapy. This study represents an in vitro evaluation of different classes of molecular targeted drugs, including small-molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and an antibody-drug conjugate, using lung PDOs. We evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) inhibitors using a suitable high-throughput assay system. Next, the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity of an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody was evaluated to visualize the interactions of immune cells with PDOs during ADCC responses. Moreover, an evaluation system was developed for the immune checkpoint inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, using PDOs. Our results demonstrate that the in vitro assay systems using PDOs were suitable for evaluating molecular targeted drugs under conditions that better reflect pathological conditions.

Long non‑coding RNA MEG‑3 suppresses gastric carcinoma cell growth, invasion and migration via EMT regulation.tGastric carcinoma is one of the most frequently diagnosed gastrointestinal tumors. Long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are broadly defined as endogenous cellular non‑coding RNA molecules. Studies have demonstrated that they may be associated with human cancer progression. In the present study, the role of lncRNA‑maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in the progression of gastric carcinoma cells was investigated in vitro and in vivo. It was demonstrated that lncRNA‑MEG3 expression was downregulated in gastric carcinoma cells compared with normal gastric cells. lncRNA‑MEG3 transfection increased E‑cadherin expression and markedly inhibited gastric carcinoma cell growth, migration and invasion. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that lncRNA‑MEG3 transfection promoted the apoptosis of gastric carcinoma cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that lncRNA‑MEG3 transfection inhibited the expression of anti‑apoptotic proteins B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl‑2) and Bcl‑2‑like protein 2 and increased the expression of pro‑-apoptotic proteins caspase‑3 and caspase‑9 in gastric carcinoma cells. lncRNA‑MEG3 transfection upregulated the expression of epithelial marker E‑cadherin and inhibited the expression of mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin in gastric carcinoma cells, which suggested that lncRNA‑MEG3 inhibited epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), which may subsequently inhibit progression in gastric carcinoma cells. The present study also revealed that lncRNA‑MEG3 transfection suppressed tumor growth mainly by decreasing the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and increasing the expression of Bcl‑2 in vivo. In conclusion, these results indicated that lncRNA‑MEG3 may regulate EMT‑associated signaling pathways and has the potential as a therapeutic target in gastric carcinoma.

Regional differences in cell-mediated immunity in people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.tTo study cell-mediated immunity in the feet of people with type 2 diabetes with polyneuropathy.||||In a cohort comprising people with type 2 diabetes with polyneuropathy (n = 17) and without polyneuropathy (n = 12) and a healthy control group (n = 12) indurations due to delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to intracutaneous Candida albicans antigen were determined in the foot and compared with those in the arm (an area relatively spared in diabetic polyneuropathy). The sizes of indurations on the foot were correlated with electromyographic measurements in the participants with diabetes.||||No differences were observed in the median size of indurations between the foot and arm in healthy controls and participants without polyneuropathy; in participants with polyneuropathy, induration sizes on the foot were smaller than on the arm: 0 (95% CI 0 to 1) vs 5 (95% CI 2 to 6) mm (P < 0.01). In participants with diabetes, larger indurations correlated with better nerve function (Spearman's rho 0.35 to 0.39).||||Our findings suggest that diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy negatively affects cell-mediated immunity in the foot.

[The efficacy of using cephalometrics to predict difficult intubation of patients with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome].tTo investigate the difference of radiological measurements between difficult-to-intubate obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome(OSAHS) patients and easily-to-intubate ones, and explore the feasibility of cephalometry in predicting difficult intubation.||||Thirty male OSAS patients who received general anesthesia underwent cephalometrics before operation. Mallampati grade was used to evaluate the intubating condition of all patients before endotracheal intubation. After awake intubation and general anaesthesia, Cormack and Lehane laryngoscope grade was used to confirm the difficult-to-intubate patients and easily-to-intubate ones. The difficult-to-intubate patients were set into group I (n=13), the easily-to-intubate patients were set into group II (n=17). X-ray cephalometric radiographs were scanned into computer, 22 cephalometric parameters were measured with CASSOS 2001 cephalometric software. The measured items included hard tissue of maxilla and mandible, soft tissue of tongue and soft palate, airway space, hyoid and other parameters. SPSS13.0 software package was used for independent sample t test.||||The interface length of tongue and soft palate (CL), the tongue length (TGL) and the hyoid-mental distance (H-MP) were significantly different between the two groups (P<0.05). In difficult-to-intubate OSAS patients, the tongue area (TA) was larger, the soft palate length (PNS-U) was longer, the Atlanto-occipital gap (AOG) was shorter, but the difference was not significant.||||X-ray cephalometric indicators closest associated with difficult intubation in OSAHS patients are CL, TGL and H-MP, which are instructive for predicting difficult intubation.

Impact of diabetic neuropathy severity on foot clearance complexity and variability during walking.tThe control of foot trajectory during swing phase is important to achieve safe clearance with the ground. Complexity of a physiological control system arises from the interaction of structural units and regulatory feedback loops that operate to enable the organism to adapt to a non-static environment. Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) impairs peripheral feedback inputs and alters ankle control during gait, which might affect toe clearance (ToC) parameters and its complexity, predisposing DPN-subjects to tripping and falling.||||How do different DPN-severity degrees change ToC trajectory and minimum ToC, and its complexity during gait of diabetic subjects?||||15 healthy controls and 69 diabetic subjects were assessed and classified into DPN-severity degrees by an expert fuzzy model: absent (n = 26), mild (n = 21) and severe (n = 22). Three-dimensional kinematics was measured during comfortable walking. ToC was the minimum vertical distance between the marker placed at the first metatarsal head and the ground during swing. Mean ToC, ToC standard deviation (SD) between trials, and sample entropy (SaEn) and standard deviation (SD) of ToC trajectory were calculated from the ToC temporal series. ANOVA and ANCOVA (with the walking speed as the covariate) and Bonferroni pairwise post-hoc tests (P < 0.05) were used to compare groups.||||Mean ToC and ToC SD did not show differences between groups (ANCOVA F = 0.436; df = 3; P = 0.705; F=1.719; df=3; P=0.170, respectively). ToC trajectory SD also did not show differences between groups (ANCOVA F = 3.98; df = 3; P = 0.755). Severe-DPN subjects showed higher ToC_Traj_SaEn than controls (ANCOVA F=2.60; df=3; P = 0.05).||||Severe-DPN subjects showed a more complex pattern of overall foot-ankle trajectory in swing phase in comparison to controls, although did not present lower minimum ToC values. The higher complexity of ToC might lead to an increase in the motor system output (more strategies, increase in variability), resulting in a more unstable system and selected motor strategies.

Novel key genes in triple-negative breast cancer identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis.tTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a special subtype of breast cancer (BC) with poor prognosis. Although some molecular mechanisms of TNBC have been elucidated, the efficacy of current treatments is limited. Therefore, it is urgently demanded to screen for novel biomarkers and drug targets for TNBC. In this study, we obtained four independent data sets (GSE76250, GSE31448, GSE43358, and METABRIC) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and the cBioPortal website. In the GSE76250 data set, 890 differentially expressed genes were identified and weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed based on them. Then, two preserved modules associated with the KI67 score were detected. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses showed genes in the modules participated in some cancer-related biological processes or pathways. Non-SMC condensin I complex subunit G (NCAPG) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 9 (ABCA9) were identified as hub genes of the modules, and the significance of hub genes was validated in the GSE43358 data set. Finally, their prognostic value was assessed by survival analysis. These findings suggested that NCAPG and ABCA9 may be the key genes of TNBC. Moreover, ABCA9 was first reported in TNBC. They deserved further studies.

Importance of lead aVR on predicting adverse cardiac events in patients with noncompaction cardiomyopathy.tNoncompaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is a relatively rare cardiac abnormality with high rates of mortality and morbidity. T-wave amplitudes during ventricular repolarization in lead aVR (TaVR) have been reported to be associated with the prognosis of various cardiovascular diseases. This study sought to investigate the prevalence and prognostic role of positive TaVR in patients with NCCM.||||We evaluated consecutive 161 patients with NCCM (65.8% men, mean age 42.5 ± 15.2 years old). Presentation electrocardiogram was assessed regarding classical parameters as well as T-wave amplitudes in lead aVR. The primary endpoint was defined as composite lethal arrhythmic events, including sudden cardiac death, ventricular fibrillation, or sustained ventricular tachycardia or appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock. Heart failure requiring hospitalization, cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality were also investigated as secondary endpoints.||||Patients with positive TaVR showed higher rates for arrhythmic events, hospitalization for heart failure, and death compared with patients without it. In multivariate Cox model, after adjusting for other known clinical and electrocardiographic risk factors, the positive TaVR was found to be a strong independent predictor of primary endpoint (HR: 4.8, 95% CI: 1.2-19.3; p = .025) and all-cause death (HR: 3.5, 95% CI: 1.0-12.1; p = .045).||||Our findings revealed that positive TaVR is significantly and independently associated with adverse outcomes in NCCM patients. This unique ECG criterion in the often ignored lead provides incremental information beyond what is available with other traditional risk factors.

Furthermore, we evaluated sensitivity and specificity of DTI-MRN from receiver operating characteristics (ROC).||||The proximal and distal FA was lowest in patients with DPN compared with nDPN and HC (p < 0.01). Likewise, proximal and distal RD was highest in patients with DPN (p < 0.01). MD and AD were also significantly different though less pronounced.

[Research progress of hepatitis B and C virus co-infection].tHepatitis B virus (HBV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection shares the same transmission routes, and thereby it is not rare in regions where the prevalence of HBV and HCV is high. However, the co-infection rates of HBV/HCV reported in different regions of the world are relatively dissimilar, and the co-infection rates of HBV/HCV in the population are unidentified due to the presence of silent HBV infection. Thus, the phenomenon of underestimation exists. HCV may have an inhibitory effect on HBV replication when HBV/HCV is co-infected, and the effect of HBV on HCV replication remains to be certain by more studies. Furthermore, the mechanism of interaction may include the direct effect of viral proteins and the indirect effect of immune mediated host response. HBV/HCV co-infection can cause more serious chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis, and can increase the risk of liver cancer. The efficacy of peginterferon plus ribavirin in patients with HBV/HCV co-infection is same as HCV monotherapy. There are few studies on the efficacy of direct-acting antiviral drugs. Patients with HBV/HCV co-infection have the risk of HBV reactivation regardless of anti-HCV treatment with peginterferon plus ribavirin or direct-acting antiviral drugs, but the probability of HBV reactivation and how to assess and prevent it needs more studies to interpret.

[Current approaches for treatment of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR)].tRare, progressive, and fatal is a short description for autosomal dominant hereditary transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis (ATTR). In the absence of a family background, delays in diagnosis are common. ATTR is often represented by a progressive, axonal fiber-length-dependent polyneuropathy (motor, autonomic, sensory). Cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal and ocular manifestations are frequently observed. ATTR is caused by mutated serum protein transthyretin (TTRm), which results in amyloid deposits.The three current concepts of ATTR treatment aim to replace, stabilize and reduce TTR synthesis. (i) The mutant TTRm is almost completely replaced in the peripheral blood after orthotopic liver transplantation by the synthesis of the wild-type (TTRwt) in the donor liver. (ii) Low molecular weight compounds stabilize the TTR tetramer and thereby minimize the formation of amyloid precursors. (iii) Gene silencers (mRNA-inhibiting oligonucleotides) reduce liver-secreted TTRm and TTRwt.Liver transplantation (LTx) is an established procedure in ATTR patients. LTx significantly prolongs survival, especially in early stage patients (< 50 years) with variant ATTRV30M. Some non-ATTRV30M variants show a higher mortality after LTx. The progression of the disease can be slowed down but not prevented by LTx. Diflunisal is a low-cost, off-label drug from the NSAID group. Similar to Tafamidis, it stabilizes the TTR tetramer. Tafamidis has been approved for the treatment of stage 1 ATTR since 2011. It is administered orally and used in patients with polyneuropathy and more recently with cardiomyopathy. Inotersen represents an antisense oligonucleotide that is administered subcutaneously (s. c.) once a week. Patisiran acts as a siRNA oligonucleotide administered intravenously (i. v.) every three weeks in combination with premedication. Both gene silencers were approved in 2018 for the treatment of ATTR stages 1 and 2. The new era of TTR gene silencers now affords an update of algorithms used for treatment of ATTR.

CKS2 promotes tumor progression and metastasis and is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in epithelial ovarian cancer.tAccumulating evidence showed that dysregulation of cyclin-dependent kinases regulatory subunit 2 (CKS2) could contribute to tumor growth and metastasis of several tumors. However, its expression and function in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) have not been investigated. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of CKS2 in EOC.||||Real-time PCR and Western blotting were used to determine the mRNA and protein expression of CKS2 in EOC tissues and cell lines. Then, the associations of CKS2 expression with clinicopathological features and patient's overall survival were determined. Proliferation assay flow cytometric analysis and transwell assay were performed to detect the relation between CKS2 and malignant behaviors of EOC cells. We also evaluated the expression of related proteins of the Akt/mTOR pathway to determine the associated molecular mechanism.||||We found that CKS2 expression was significantly up-regulated in both EOC tissues and cell lines. Clinically, high expression of CKS2 was associated with advanced FIGO stage, histological grade and shorter overall survival of EOC patients. We also found that knockdown of CKS2 suppressed proliferation, invasion, and migration of EOC cells in vitro, and CKS2 could promote EMT progress by modulating EMT-related molecules. Finally, Western blot demonstrated that down-regulation of CKS2 suppressed the expression of p-Akt and p-mTOR.||||Our findings indicated that CKS2 might function as a tumor promoter by modulating Akt/mTOR pathway in EOC and could serve as a promising prognostic biomarker for EOC.

Immunoexpression of SPANX-C in metastatic uveal melanoma.tUveal melanoma is a rare disease but it is the most common primary intraocular malignant tumor in adults with poor late prognosis. About 50% of patients will develop liver metastasis far from the enucleation within 10-15 years. Our study examined SPANX-C expression levels in primary uveal melanoma both with and without metastasis to assess if they can be used to predict metastasis. This study included a total of 55 patients, 28 males and 27 females, with uveal melanoma. A significantly high expression of SPANX-C was seen in 19/23 (82.6%) patients with metastasis, and only in 11/32 (38.5%) patients without metastasis. In conclusion, we found that SPANX-C expression could play a role in tumor progression of uveal melanoma.

Parathyroidectomy as a Cure for Calciphylaxis in a Non-Dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease Patient?tBACKGROUND Calciphylaxis is a rare and fatal systemic disease which most commonly occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease. It is a poorly understood vascular calcification with unclear pathology that leads to vascular compromise due to vascular occlusion with endoluminal calcification. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 61-year-old male with chronic kidney disease stage 5 who developed calciphylaxis. The patient was diagnosed with dry gangrene of the second and third digits of the right hand and second, third, and fourth phalanges of the left hand. Despite medical therapy and local wound care, the lesions progressively worsened with time. The patient was found to have secondary hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid hormone was 1028 pg/mL) and underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy. In our patient, the skin lesions due to calciphylaxis completely resolved over the course of 12 months. CONCLUSIONS Parathyroidectomy has been associated with clinical benefit in patients with calciphylaxis. Clinicians should consider parathyroidectomy in the setting of high parathyroid hormone and calciphylaxis. Although parathyroidectomy is an effective treatment option for calciphylaxis it is not a definitive treatment and calciphylaxis can occur, though rarely, even after parathyroidectomy. There is a need to do further studies in order to confirm the efficacy of parathyroidectomy.

We report a well-documented case of an SFT with malignant histology arising in the inguinal region.||||A 59-year-old man, with an unremarkable medical history, presented with a slow-growing painless mass in the left side of the inguinal region, which he had ignored for 3 years. On clinical examination, there was an indurated, irreducible, mobile, and painless mass in the left side of the inguinal area. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography results revealed a 15-cm mass made up of soft tissue and with nonspecific radiologic aspect. The tumor was totally excised, and the results of the pathologic examination concluded it was an SFT.||||The aim of our case report is to present a rare extrapleural localization of an SFT. Although its radiologic features are not specific, SFT should be considered in the differential diagnosis of inguinal masses.

Report for anesthetic management is limited in these patients under surgical resection until now.||||In September 2015, a 24-year-old male presented to the department of cardiology with right flank pain and hypertensive urgency in our hospital. Contrast-enhanced CT abdomen and MRI abdomen revealed a mass phaeochromocytoma in right adrenal, which invaded the right inferior vena cava(IVC)wall along with IVC thrombus. Echocardiography shown no abnormal detection. Finally, this patient gave up the surgical resection of phaeochromocytoma and chose the expectant treatment. In April 2018, this patient once again presented to the emergence department in our hospital, he had experienced persistent cough and intermittent wheezing for 5 h. Contrast-enhanced CT and echocardiography shown existing IVC thrombus had extended into the right atrium. After the careful preoperative preparation, adrenalectomy with complete thrombus excision by inferior vena cava exploration and right atriotomy were performed successfully by a multidisciplinary team. After one month post-operation care, this patient healthily left our hospital.||||To the best of our knowledge, the occurrence of pheochromocytoma with IVC and right atrium thrombosis has not been reported in mainland China so far. This clinical case may supply a rare reference experience for surgical treatment and anesthetic management in the group of phaeochromocytoma patient with distance vascular extension.

Stage at diagnosis and stage-specific survival of breast cancer in Latin America and the Caribbean: A systematic review and meta-analysis.tFemale breast cancer is the most common cancer in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries and is the leading cause of cancer deaths. The high mortality-to-incidence ratio in the regions is associated with mainly the high proportion of advanced stage diagnosis, and also to inadequate access to health care. In this study we aimed to systematically review the proportion of advanced stage (III-IV) at diagnosis (pas) and the five-year stage-specific survival estimates of breast cancer in LAC countries.||||We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature) to identify studies, in any language, indexed before Nov 5, 2018. We also conducted manual search by reviewing citations of papers found. pas was summarized by random effects model meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis to identify sources of variation. Stage-specific survival probabilities were described as provided by study authors, as it was not possible to conduct meta-analysis. PROSPERO CRD42017052493.||||For pas we included 63 studies, 13 of which population-based, from 22 countries comprising 221,255 women diagnosed from 1966 to 2017. The distribution of patients by stage varied greatly in LAC (pas 40.8%, 95%CI 37.0% to 44.6%; I2 = 99%; p<0.0001). The heterogeneity was not explained by any variable included in the meta-regression. There was no difference in pas among the Caribbean (pas 43.0%, 95%CI 33.1% to 53.6%), Central America (pas 47.0%, 95%CI 40.4% to 53.8%) and South America (pas 37.7%, 95%CI 33.1% to 42.5%) regions. For 5-year stage-specific survival we included 37 studies, comprising 28,988 women from ten countries. Seven of these studies were included also for pas. Since we were unable to adjust for age, comparability between countries and regions was hampered, and as expected, the results varied widely from study to study.||||LAC countries should look to address concerns with early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer, and wherever viable implement screening programs and to provide timely treatment.

In fact, RPN has shown good functional and oncologic outcome. In this manuscript, we are reporting on the incidence and pattern of recurrence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treated with RPN.||||We reviewed prospectively collected data of patients who underwent RPN between September 2009 and March 2018. We selected patients with final pathologic diagnosis of RCC after the resection of their SRM. We described the incidence and pattern of recurrence in the patients who had it.||||A total of 335 patients with SRM underwent RPN. We found 269 patients to have RCC on the final pathologic evaluation of the SRM. Eight cases of recurrence were found with a recurrence rate of 2.9% after the mean follow-up period of 31 months (range 18-72). The pattern of recurrence presented as follows: two patients (0.7%) had trocar site recurrence (TSR), one patient (0.37%) had locoregional recurrence, and three patients (1.1%) had recurrence of the disease at the resection bed. Two patients (0.7%) developed second primary tumor in the other kidney. No cancer-related mortality occurred during the follow-up period.||||TSR, locoregional recurrence, tumor bed recurrence, and contralateral tumor development are observed patterns of RCC recurrence after RPN. Recurrence was seen in up to 72 months. RPN provides great cancer control and high cure rate when utilized to treat RCC presenting as SRM.

State-of-the-Art Review: Echocardiography in Pulmonary Hypertension.tPulmonary hypertension is a progressive and often fatal disease that frequently presents with dyspnoea on exertion and results in increased right ventricular afterload and right ventricular failure. Although cardiac catheterisation is required for a formal diagnosis, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) has a central role as a screening tool in those with symptoms and those at risk for developing pulmonary vascular disease. Echocardiographic techniques can be employed to estimate pulmonary artery pressure and resistance, right atrial pressure as well as to derive indirect information about right heart structure and function. Potential causes for pulmonary hypertension may also be identified such as congenital heart disease or left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. An increasing body of evidence has demonstrated the important prognostic utility of echocardiographic data in pulmonary hypertension and highlighted the potential for TTE to help clinicians understand whether treatment responses have been adequate or an escalation in therapy is necessary, as therapeutic options continue to expand for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Although traditional echocardiographic techniques only allow surrogate measures of right ventricular systolic function due to the complex shape of the chamber, newer techniques have enabled three-dimensional assessment of the right ventricle to assess right ventricular volume and contractility. This review will discuss traditional methods as well as newer echocardiographic methods in the setting of pulmonary hypertension.

An update on genetic susceptibility in lupus nephritis.tSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by multiple system involvement and positive serum autoantibodies. Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most common and serious complication of SLE, and it is the main cause of death in patients with SLE. Abnormalities in the immune system lead to LN and involve a variety of cells (T cells, B cells, macrophages, NK cells, etc.), cytokines (interleukin, tumor necrosis factor α, etc.) and their related pathways. Previous studies have shown that the interactions of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis and development of LN. In recent years, one genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a number of gene association studies have explored the susceptibility genes of LN, including immunization-, inflammation-, adhesion- and other pathway-related genes. These genes participate in or suggest the pathogenesis and progression of LN. In this review, we summarize the genetic susceptibility of LN and discuss the possible mechanism underlying the susceptibility genes of LN.

Wolfram syndrome, a rare neurodegenerative disease: from pathogenesis to future treatment perspectives.tWolfram syndrome (WS), a rare genetic disorder, is considered the best prototype of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) diseases. Classical WS features are childhood-onset diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, deafness, diabetes insipidus, neurological signs, and other abnormalities. Two causative genes (WFS1 and WFS2) have been identified. The transmission of the disease takes place in an autosomal recessive mode but autosomal dominant mutations responsible for WS-related disorders have been described. Prognosis is poor, death occurs at the median age of 39 years with a major cause represented by respiratory failure as a consequence of brain stem atrophy and neurodegeneration. The aim of this narrative review is to focus on etiology, pathogenesis and natural history of WS for an adequate patient management and for the discussion of future therapeutic interventions.||||WS requires a multidisciplinary approach in order to be successfully treated. A prompt diagnosis decreases morbidity and mortality through prevention and treatment of complications. Being a monogenic pathology, WS represents a perfect model to study the mechanisms of ER stress and how this condition leads to cell death, in comparison with other prevalent diseases in which multiple factors interact to produce the disease manifestations. WS is also an important disease prototype to identify drugs and molecules associated with ER homeostasis. Evidence indicates that specific metabolic diseases (type 1 and type 2 diabetes), neurodegenerative diseases, atherosclerosis, inflammatory pathologies and also cancer are closely related to ER dysfunction.||||Therapeutic strategies in WS are based on drug repurposing (i.e., investigation of approved drugs for novel therapeutic indications) with the aim to stop the progression of the disease by reducing the endoplasmic reticulum stress. An extensive understanding of WS from pathophysiology to therapy is fundamental and more studies are necessary to better manage this devastating disease and guarantee the patients a better quality of life and longer life expectancy.

LV parasternal long-axis views were acquired with an experimental ultrasound scanner at 1266 ± 317 frames per seconds. The SW velocity induced by MVC was measured from myocardial acceleration maps. SW velocities differed significantly between HT patients and controls (5.83 ± 1.20 m/s vs. 4.04 ± 0.96 m/s; P < 0.001). In addition, the HT2 group had the highest SW velocities (P < 0.001), whereas values between controls and the HT1 group were comparable (P = 0.075). Significant positive correlations were found between SW velocity and LV remodelling (interventricular septum thickness: r = 0.786, P < 0.001; LV mass index: r = 0.761, P < 0.001). SW velocity normalized for wall stress indicated that myocardial stiffness in the HT2 group was twice as high as in controls (P < 0.001), whereas values of the HT1 group overlapped with the controls (P = 1.00).||||SW velocity as measure of myocardial stiffness is higher in HT patients compared with healthy controls, particularly in advanced hypertensive heart disease. Patients with concentric remodelling have still normal myocardial properties whereas patients with concentric hypertrophy show significant stiffening.

Cytomegalovirus Seroprevalence and Birth Prevalence of Congenital CMV Infection in Bosnia and Herzegovina: A Single-Center Experience.tCongenital cytomegalovirus infection (cCMV) is a leading cause of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and neurodevelopmental disabilities in developed countries. Although high cCMV rates have been reported in populations with high seroprevalence, the cCMV prevalence in low/middle-income countries in Europe has not been defined.||||To determine cytomegalovirus (CMV) seroprevalence and the cCMV prevalence in Bosnia and Herzegovina.||||Between March 2010 and February 2019, 5222 sera samples from patients seen at the University Clinical Hospital Mostar were tested for CMV IgG. The cord blood samples collected from 2091 infants between July 2011 and January 2013 were analyzed for CMV IgG and CMV DNA. The cCMV prevalence was determined by testing saliva swabs from 1293 infants between November 2015 and October 2016.||||The overall CMV IgG prevalence was 81.4% (95% confidence interval: 0.8-0.82). Significantly higher prevalence was observed among females (84.9%) than in males (77.0%), and the rate increased from 50.8% in the 1 to 5 years group to 97.7% in the group > 65 years old. Most cord blood samples (2091/1925, 92.1%) were CMV IgG positive, and 2 (0.1%) were CMV DNA positive. Of the 1293 saliva swabs, 8 (0.62%; 95% confidence interval: 0.3-1.2) were CMV positive. All 8 infected infants had asymptomatic cCMV, and none had SNHL at 18 months of age.||||In a highly CMV seropositive population, the prevalence of cCMV was lower compared to that reported from other low/middle-income countries populations. None of the infected infants had symptomatic infection or SNHL at 18 months.

Identifying Potential Prognostic Markers for Muscle-Invasive Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma by Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis.tMuscle-invasive bladder urothelial carcinoma (MIBC) is characterized as a genetic heterogeneous cancer with a high percentage of recurrence and worse prognosis. Identify the prognostic potentials of novel genes for muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer could at least provide important information for early detection and clinical treatment. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm, a powerful systems biology approach, was utilized to extract co-expressed gene networks from mRNA expression dataset to construct transcriptional modules in MIBC samples, which was associated with demographic and clinical traits of MIBC patients. The potential prognostic markers of MIBC were screened out in the discovery dataset and verified in an independent external validation dataset. A total of 8 co-expression modules were detected through the WGCNA algorithm in the discovery datasets based on 401 MIBC samples. One transcriptional module enriched in cell development was observed to be correlated with the MIBC prognosis in the discovery datasets (HR = 1.48, 95%CI = 1.04-2.11) and independently verified in an external dataset (HR = 3.59, 95%CI = 1.09-11.79). High expression of hub genes including discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (DDR2), PDZ and LIM domain 3 (PDLIM3), zinc finger protein 521 (ZNF521), methionine sulfoxide reductase B3 (MSRB3) were significantly associated with the unfavorable survival of MIBC patients. We identified and validated four novel potential biomarkers associated with prognosis of MIBC patients by constructing genes co-expression networks. The discovery of these genetic markers may provide a new target for the development of MIBC chemotherapeutic drugs.

Size of Subcortical Band Heterotopia Influences the Susceptibility to Hyperthermia-Induced Seizures in a Rat Model.tStudies conducted in human and rodent models have suggested that preexisting neurodevelopmental defects could predispose immature brains to febrile seizures (FS). However, the impact of the anatomical extent of preexisting cortical malformations on FS susceptibility was never assessed. Here, we induced hyperthermic seizures (HS) in rats with bilateral subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) and found variable degrees of HS susceptibility depending on inter-individual anatomical differences in size and extent of SBH. This indicates that an association exists between the overall extent or location of a cortical malformation, and the predisposition to FS. This also suggests that various predisposing factors and underlying causes may contribute to the etiology of complex FS.

Diagnostic accuracy and prognostic applications of CYFRA 21-1 in head and neck cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.tCytokeratin fraction 21-1 (CYFRA 21-1) has been widely studied as an important biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer for both diagnosis and prognosis. Many studies have also assessed the clinical applications of CYFRA 21-1 in head and neck cancer, but the diagnostic and prognostic values of CYFRA 21-1 are not yet fully established. This pooled analysis aims at evaluating the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic applications of CYFRA 21-1 in patients with head and neck cancer. A systematic retrieval of literatures was conducted without time or language restrictions by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane library and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. Twenty studies were eligible for systematic review, of which 14 conformed for diagnostic analysis and 7 for prognostic analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of CYFRA 21-1 analysis were 0.53 (95% CI: 0.39-0.67) and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.93-0.99), respectively. A high level of CYFRA 21-1 was significantly correlated with shorter overall survival (HR 1.33, 95% CI: 1.13-1.56) and disease-free survival (HR 1.48; 95%CI: 1.10-1.97). Current evidence indicates that the level of CYFRA 21-1 in the serum could be used as an indicator for monitoring tumor status and evaluating its curative effects.

Mitochondrial DNA mutations in prostate cancer bone metastases.tProstate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer in men. Those with local or regional disease often have good long-term prognosis, but patients with metastatic disease face high morbidity and mortality. The vast majority of cases with distant spread have some degree of bony involvement. The reason for the disproportionately high percentage of metastasis to bone relative to other metastatic sites remains unclear. A growing body of evidence suggests mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is associated with prostate cancer, and the effects of mtDNA on tumor growth may be augmented by the bone microenvironment. Here, we review our latest study analyzing mtDNA mutations in 10 patients with advanced prostate cancer and both bone and soft tissue metastases. This cohort of patients had significantly increased somatic mtDNA mutations in bone metastasis compared to paired primary tumor and soft tissue metastasis. In addition, a recurrent mtDNA mutation at nucleotide position 10398, was exclusively found in bone metastasis in 7 of 10 patients with advanced prostate cancer, with no such mutations found in paired benign prostate, primary tumor, or soft tissue metastasis. We describe the results from this work and review the relevant literature on the role of mitochondrial DNA in prostate cancer bone metastases.

[Association between admission diagnosis and immunotherapy outcome in patients with autoimmune epilepsy].tTo evaluate the impact of admission diagnosis on seizure outcome in patients with autoimmune epilepsy (AE).  Methods: We conducted a retrospective study on 40 AE patients at Department of Neurology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University from Jan. 1st, 2017 to Nov. 21st, 2018. According to their admission diagnosis, these patients were further assigned into 2 groups: An AE diagnosed group and an AE undiagnosed group. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), electroencephalogram, and brain imaging were compared between the 2 groups. Favorable seizure outcome was defined as >50% reduction of seizure frequency at the first follow-up. The impact of admission diagnosis on seizure outcome of AE patients was analyzed.  Results: The ages of 40 AE patients were (33.23±16.41) years, comprising 19 males and 21 females. No significant difference was found between the AE diagnosed group and the AE undiagnosed group in gender, age, central nervous system-specific Ab profile, CSF, and brain imaging. Duration of symptom onset to Ab detection was significantly longer in the AE undiagnosed group than that in the AE diagnosed group (P<0.01). Duration of symptom onset to immunotherapy was also significantly longer in the AE undiagnosed group than that in the AE diagnosed group (P<0.001). There were more patients with favorable seizure outcome in the AE diagnosed group than the AE undiagnosed group (P<0.05).  Conclusion: Admission diagnosis for patients with AE is associated with seizure outcome after immunotherapy. For adult-onset epilepsy or epilepsy with unknown etiology, the diagnosis of AE should be considered. Early diagnosis of AE and prompt initiation of immunosuppressive treatment are crucial to increase the likelihood of achieving favorable seizure outcome.

Intersectin 1 (ITSN1) contributes to the actin cytoskeleton reconstruction in breast cancer.||||The objective of this study to explore the functions of ITSN1 in breast carcinoma.||||We downloaded microarray datasets GSE8087, GSE50697, and GSE98238 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were used to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network using STRING database, and the modules from PPI network were verified by Cytoscape software. Gene ontology terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome pathway were used to analyze the biological functions using the DAVID database. ONCOMINE, GEPIA, UALCAN, and Human Protein Atlas databases were used to investigate the characteristics of ITSN1 for the prognosis of breast carcinoma. Cell counting kit-8, flow cytometry, and colony formation assays were used to detect cell viability, cell apoptosis, and cell proliferation. RT-PCR and Western blot assays were used to detect ITSN1, Ki67, and cleaved caspase-3 expressions.||||Low expressions of ITSN1 were significantly associated with clinical cancer stages. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed low expression of ITSN1 in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. ITSN1 inhibition could promote cell proliferation and inhibit cell apoptosis, while ITSN1 overexpression could inhibit cell proliferation and increase cell apoptosis by regulating the levels of expression of Ki67 and cleaved-caspase-3.||||The results indicated that ITSN1 could be a prognostic biomarker for survivals of breast cancer patients.

Severe transient left ventricular dysfunction in a patient with Legionella pneumophila pneumonia.tLegionella pneumophila infection (legionellosis) usually presents as a multisystemic disease, predominantly affecting the lungs (Legionnaires' disease - LD). Immunodeficiency, chemotherapy or chronic steroids use increase the risk of developing LD. Extrapulmonary manifestations of LD include cardiac complications: myocarditis, pericarditis or endocarditis.||||The authors describe a case of a 51-year-old female with a history of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, Sjögren syndrome and chronic lymphocytic leukemia who was admitted due to a high fever, fatigue, tachycardia, dyspnea and cough. Chest X-ray and CT showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrations and pleural effusion. LD was diagnosed on positive L. pneumophila urinary antigen test. Echocardiography revealed severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with substantially decreased ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain (GLS), with a pattern resembling reverse takotsubo syndrome (rTTS). The coronary arteries in non-invasive coronary angiography were normal. During therapy with levofloxacin and intravenous immunoglobulins as well as with carvedilol, ramipril and diuretics, gradual clinical improvement with complete normalization of LV function was observed within 5 weeks. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) performed on day 35 revealed only small intramural foci of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with localization not corresponding to the most decreased regional longitudinal strain in the initial echocardiographic examination. The authors suggest that the mechanism of transient LV dysfunction in the case presented may have been of complex nature, including LD myocarditis and stress-induced cardiomyopathy (with the prevalence of the latter) which has not so far been reported in the literature.

Novel key genes in triple-negative breast cancer identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis.tTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a special subtype of breast cancer (BC) with poor prognosis. Although some molecular mechanisms of TNBC have been elucidated, the efficacy of current treatments is limited. Therefore, it is urgently demanded to screen for novel biomarkers and drug targets for TNBC. In this study, we obtained four independent data sets (GSE76250, GSE31448, GSE43358, and METABRIC) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and the cBioPortal website. In the GSE76250 data set, 890 differentially expressed genes were identified and weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed based on them. Then, two preserved modules associated with the KI67 score were detected. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses showed genes in the modules participated in some cancer-related biological processes or pathways. Non-SMC condensin I complex subunit G (NCAPG) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 9 (ABCA9) were identified as hub genes of the modules, and the significance of hub genes was validated in the GSE43358 data set. Finally, their prognostic value was assessed by survival analysis. These findings suggested that NCAPG and ABCA9 may be the key genes of TNBC. Moreover, ABCA9 was first reported in TNBC. They deserved further studies.

Impact of diabetic neuropathy severity on foot clearance complexity and variability during walking.tThe control of foot trajectory during swing phase is important to achieve safe clearance with the ground. Complexity of a physiological control system arises from the interaction of structural units and regulatory feedback loops that operate to enable the organism to adapt to a non-static environment. Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) impairs peripheral feedback inputs and alters ankle control during gait, which might affect toe clearance (ToC) parameters and its complexity, predisposing DPN-subjects to tripping and falling.||||How do different DPN-severity degrees change ToC trajectory and minimum ToC, and its complexity during gait of diabetic subjects?||||15 healthy controls and 69 diabetic subjects were assessed and classified into DPN-severity degrees by an expert fuzzy model: absent (n = 26), mild (n = 21) and severe (n = 22). Three-dimensional kinematics was measured during comfortable walking. ToC was the minimum vertical distance between the marker placed at the first metatarsal head and the ground during swing. Mean ToC, ToC standard deviation (SD) between trials, and sample entropy (SaEn) and standard deviation (SD) of ToC trajectory were calculated from the ToC temporal series. ANOVA and ANCOVA (with the walking speed as the covariate) and Bonferroni pairwise post-hoc tests (P < 0.05) were used to compare groups.||||Mean ToC and ToC SD did not show differences between groups (ANCOVA F = 0.436; df = 3; P = 0.705; F=1.719; df=3; P=0.170, respectively). ToC trajectory SD also did not show differences between groups (ANCOVA F = 3.98; df = 3; P = 0.755). Severe-DPN subjects showed higher ToC_Traj_SaEn than controls (ANCOVA F=2.60; df=3; P = 0.05).||||Severe-DPN subjects showed a more complex pattern of overall foot-ankle trajectory in swing phase in comparison to controls, although did not present lower minimum ToC values. The higher complexity of ToC might lead to an increase in the motor system output (more strategies, increase in variability), resulting in a more unstable system and selected motor strategies.67f9b757c6e29d7be26650eeb179851fa4facaa016816bc3cbcb8907943808b9	They were significantly associated with the survival of _PHENOTYPE_ patients and could serve as _DISEASE_-specific biomarkers for prognosis.

Systematic identification of dysregulated lncRNAs associated with platinum-based chemotherapy response across 11 cancer types.tAberrant expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) leads to the development of chemoresistance by regulating a series of biological processes, which is one of the major obstacles in the cancer treatment. This study aimed to identify some key lncRNAs that are associated with platinum-based chemoresistance in multiple cancers. Regulating the expression levels of these lncRNAs can enhance the sensitivity of patients to chemotherapy drugs and improve the therapeutic effect of cancer. By systematically analyzing 648 samples regarding platinum drug response from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we have identified 32 dysregulated lncRNAs across 11 cancer types that could affect platinum-based chemotherapy response, of which 78.125% (25/32) were significantly down-regulated in drug-resistant samples. Drug response prediction model that had been constructed based on the expression pattern of these dysregulated lncRNAs could accurately predict the chemotherapy response of tumor patients, and the area under the curve (AUC) was between 0.8034 and 0.9984. In particular, all of these dysregulated lncRNAs that we identified were cancer-specific. They were significantly associated with the survival of tumor patients and could serve as cancer-specific biomarkers for prognosis. In conclusion, this study will contribute to improving the drug resistance of tumor patients during chemotherapy, and it is of real significance for selecting effective chemotherapy drugs and achieving precision medicine.

CCL5 of glioma-associated microglia/macrophages regulates glioma migration and invasion via calcium-dependent matrix metalloproteinase-2.tGlioma-associated myeloid (GAM) infiltrates are comprised of macrophages of peripheral origin and brain-intrinsic microglia, which support tumor progression. CCL5 is an inflammatory mediator produced by immune cells and is involved in tumor growth and migration in several cancers including glioma. However, the mechanisms detailing how CCL5 facilitates glioma invasion remain largely unresolved.||||Glioma migration and invasion were determined by wound healing, transwell assay, and 3D µ-slide chemotaxis assay. The expression levels of CCL5, CD68, MMP-2, p-CaMKII, p-Akt, and p-PYK2 were determined by cytokine array, q-PCR, western blot, or IHC. Zymography and intracellular calcium assays were used to analyze MMP-2 activity and intracellular calcium levels, respectively.||||CCL5 modulated the migratory and invasive activities of human glioma cells in association with MMP-2 expression. In response to CCL5, glioma cells underwent a synchronized increase in intracellular calcium levels, p-CaMKII and p-Akt expression levels. CCL5-directed glioma invasion and increases in MMP-2 were suppressed after inhibition of p-CaMKII. Glioma cells tended to migrate toward GM-CSF-activated GAM conditioned media in which CCL5 was abundant. This homing effect was associated with MMP-2 upregulation, and could be ameliorated either by controlling intracellular and extracellular calcium levels or by CCL5 antagonism. Clinical results also revealed the associations between CCL5 and GAM activation.||||Our results suggest that modulation of glioma CaMKII may restrict the effect of CCL5 on glioma invasion and could be a potential therapeutic target for alleviating glioma growth.

Patients were assigned to one of the three groups according to size: < 5 cm, very large (5-7.9 cm) and ultra-large (≥ 8 cm). Descriptive and comparative analyses between groups were performed.||||TEM was indicated in 761 patients. Five hundred and seven patients (66.6%) with adenoma in the preoperative biopsy were included in the study. Three hundred and nine out of 507 (60.9%) tumors < 5 cm, 162/507 (32%) very large tumors (5-7.9 cm) and 36/507 (7.1%) ultra-large tumors (≥ 8 cm) were reviewed. Morbidity increased with tumor size: 17.5% in tumors < 5 cm, 26.5% in those 5-7.9 cm, and 36.1% in those > 8 cm. Peritoneal perforation, fragmentation, free margins and stenosis were also more common in very large and ultra-large tumors (p < 0.001). There were no statistical differences between the groups in the definitive pathology (p = 0.38).||||TEM in these large tumors is associated with higher rates of morbidity, peritoneal perforation, free margins and stenosis. Although these tumors do not require total mesorectal excision and are eligible for TEM, the surgery must be carried out by experienced surgeons.

Phenotypic Plasticity of Fibroblasts during Mammary Carcinoma Development.t Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumor microenvironment contribute to all stages of tumorigenesis and are usually considered to be tumor-promoting cells. CAFs show a remarkable degree of heterogeneity, which is attributed to developmental origin or to local environmental niches, resulting in distinct CAF subsets within individual tumors. While CAF heterogeneity is frequently investigated in late-stage tumors, data on longitudinal CAF development in tumors are lacking. To this end, we used the transgenic polyoma middle T oncogene-induced mouse mammary carcinoma model and performed whole transcriptome analysis in FACS-sorted fibroblasts from early- and late-stage tumors. We observed a shift in fibroblast populations over time towards a subset previously shown to negatively correlate with patient survival, which was confirmed by multispectral immunofluorescence analysis. Moreover, we identified a transcriptomic signature distinguishing CAFs from early- and late-stage tumors. Importantly, the signature of early-stage CAFs correlated well with tumor stage and survival in human mammary carcinoma patients. A random forest analysis suggested predictive value of the complete set of differentially expressed genes between early- and late-stage CAFs on bulk tumor patient samples, supporting the clinical relevance of our findings. In conclusion, our data show transcriptome alterations in CAFs during tumorigenesis in the mammary gland, which suggest that CAFs are educated by the tumor over time to promote tumor development. Moreover, we show that murine CAF gene signatures can harbor predictive value for human cancer.

Towards the Optical Detection of Field Cancerization in the Buccal Mucosa of Patients with Lung Cancer.tAn increase in detection of early-stage asymptomatic lung tumors could increase the overall survival rate of lung cancer patients. A new approach to cancer (pre-)screening focusses on detecting field cancerization instead of the tumor itself. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of optical spectroscopy to detect field cancerization in the buccal mucosa of lung cancer patients.||||Optical buccal mucosa measurements were performed in lung cancer patients and controls using multidiameter single-fiber reflectance spectroscopy. We analyzed whether the measured optical parameters could distinguish lung cancer patients from controls.||||' at 800 nm had a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 63%. The microvascular blood oxygen saturation of the lung cancer patients was also higher than the COPD patients (78% vs. 62%, P=.002), this is probably a consequence of the systemic effect of COPD.||||' at 800 nm is increased in the buccal mucosa of patients with lung cancer compared to controls with COPD. This might be an indication of field cancerization in the oral cavity of patients with lung cancer.

FDG-PET predicted unfavorable tumor histology in living donor liver transplant recipients; a retrospective cohort study.tTumor histology affects outcome after liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study explores the association between F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and tumor histology in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) recipients and their outcome.||||Two hundred fifty-eight patients with primary liver tumors who underwent FDG-PET before LDLT were enrolled in this retrospective study. Unfavorable tumor histology was defined as primary liver tumor other than a well- or moderately differentiated HCC. Thirteen patients had unfavorable tumor histology, including 2 poorly differentiated HCC, 2 sarcomatoid HCC, 5 combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma, 3 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 1 hilar cholangiocarcinoma.||||FDG-PET positivity was significantly associated with unfavorable tumor histology (P < 0.001). Both FDG-PET positivity and unfavorable tumor histology were significant independent predictors of tumor recurrence and overall survival. In a subgroup analysis of patients with FDG-PET-positive tumors, unfavorable tumor histology was a significant independent predictor of tumor recurrence and overall survival. High FDG uptake (tumor to non-tumor uptake ratio ≥ 2) was a significant predictor of unfavorable tumor histology. Patients with high FDG uptake and/or unfavorable tumors had significantly higher 3-year cumulative recurrence rate (70.8% versus 26.2%, P = 0.004) and worse 3-year overall survival (34.1% versus 70.8%, P = 0.012) compared to those with low FDG uptake favorable tumors.||||The expression of FDG-PET is highly associated with histology of explanted HCC and predicts the recurrence. FDG-PET-positive tumors with high FDG uptake may be considered contraindication for LDLT due to high recurrence rate except when pathology proves favorable histology.

Neuroendocrine neoplasms of gastrointestinal tract and secondary primary synchronous tumors: A systematic review of case reports. Casualty or causality?tNeuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) can arise in most of the epithelial organs of the body and are not a rare condition in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The presence of NENs in GIT associated with other secondary primary malignancies (SPM) has been considered an exotic event. This study aims to describe the case reports of NENs accompanied by synchronous primary tumors.||||We performed a systematic literature search of the databases Scopus, PubMed, Scielo and LILACS to identify case reports that described the presence of NENs in GIT with SPM. 78 case reports were included. The mean of age of the cases was 60.2 years. 60% were male. 95.4% were NENs G1. 17 cases of NENs had metastasis. 80% of SPM were recognized in the GIT (36% in stomach, 27% in large intestine, 11.2% in small intestine, and 5.6% in esophagus). The most common type of SPM was adenocarcinoma (49.4%), followed by GIST (13.5%), other NENs in different GIT segment (7.9%), lymphoma (6.8%), and squamous cell carcinoma (4.5%). The most common tumor in GIT was adenocarcinoma (97.6%) and the presence of adenocarcinoma in the same segment of GIT was found in 68.4% of the cases. Association between adenocarcinomas and NENs in GIT (p:<0.0001) and adenocarcinoma and tumor in the same segment of GIT location were observed (p<0.001).||||These results demonstrate that NENs with SPM are not a rare condition. Several theories have been proposed to explain this association; one of these is the ability of NENs to generate synchronous tumors by autocrine and paracrine effect. We observed an association between adenocarcinomas and NENs in the same segment of GIT.

Amide proton transfer imaging of glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, and breast cancer cells on a 11.7 T magnetic resonance imaging system.tThe purpose of this study was (i) to determine the optimal magnetization transfer (MT) pulse parameter for amide proton transfer (APT) chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging on an ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system and (ii) to use APT CEST imaging to noninvasively assess brain orthotopic and ectopic tumor cells transplanted into the mouse brain.||||To evaluate APT without the influence of other metabolites, we prepared egg white phantoms. Next, we used 7-11-week-old nude female mice and the following cell lines to establish tumors after injection into the left striatum of mice: C6 (rat glioma, n = 8) as primary tumors and Neuro-2A (mouse neuroblastoma, n = 11) and MDA-MB231 (human breast cancer, n = 8) as metastatic tumors. All MRI experiments were performed on an 11.7 T vertical-bore scanner. CEST imaging was performed at 1 week after injection of Neuro-2A cells and at 2 weeks after injection of C6 and MDA-MB231 cells. The MT pulse amplitude was set at 2.2 μT or 4.4 μT. We calculated and compared the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) and difference of MTR asymmetry between normal tissue and tumor (ΔMTR asymmetry) on APT CEST images between mouse models of brain tumors. Then, we performed hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and Ki-67 immunohistochemical staining to compare the APT CEST effect on tumor tissues and the pathological findings.||||Phantom study of the amide proton phantom containing chicken egg white, z-spectra obtained at a pulse length of 500 ms showed smaller peaks, whereas those obtained at a pulse length of 2000 ms showed slightly higher peaks. The APT CEST effect on tumor tissues was clearer at a pulse amplitude of 2.2 μT than at 4.4 μT. For all mouse models of brain tumors, ΔMTR asymmetry was higher at 2.2 μT than at 4.4 μT. ΔMTR asymmetry was significantly higher for the Neuro-2A model than for the MDA-MB231 model. HE staining revealed light bleeding in Neuro-2A tumors. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the density of Ki-67-positive cells was higher in Neuro-2A tumors than in C6 or MDA-MB231 tumors.||||The MTR was higher at 4.4 μT than at 2.2 μT for each concentration of egg white at a pulse length of 500 ms or 2000 ms. High-resolution APT CEST imaging on an ultra-high-field MRI system was able to provide tumor information such as proliferative potential and intratumoral bleeding, noninvasively.

CXCL1-LCN2 paracrine axis promotes progression of prostate cancer via the Src activation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.tMechanisms driving the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer are believed to relate substantially to the tumor microenvironment. However, the cross-talks between tumor epithelial cell, stromal cells, and immune cells are yet to be fully elucidated. The present study aims to determine the role of chemokine and neutrophil derived cytokine paracrine axis in mediating the interaction between tumor cells, stromal myofibroblasts, and neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment of prostate cancer.||||To identify myofibroblasts and neutrophil derived specific proteins affecting progression of prostate cancer, bioinformatics analyses were firstly performed in independent human prostate cancer gene expression data sets from the GEO data bank. Expression of stromal myofibroblasts secretory chemokine CXCL1 and neutrophil derived cytokine LCN2 was evaluated in prostate tissues via immunohistochemistry assay. We further investigated the effect of CXCL1 and LCN2 on prostate cancer using in vivo and in vitro models, and explored the underlying signal transduction pathways.||||A CXCL1-LCN2 paracrine network was confirmed in prostate cancer tissue samples, which was correlated with the biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. Of note, CXCL1-LCN2 axis activates Src signaling, triggers the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), consequently promotes the migration of prostate cancer cells, leading to enhanced tumor metastasis.||||Our findings may provide enhanced insight into the interactions of carcinoma-stromal cells and immune cells linked to prostate cancer progression, wherein CXCL1-LCN2 axis is a key contributor to prostate cancer cells migration. These data indicate tumor microenvironment and Src signaling pathway may be potential therapeutic targets of prostate cancer treatment.

Peripapillary retinal artery in first diagnosed and untreated normal tension glaucoma.tGlaucoma, an important cause of visual impairment in many countries, remains a common eye condition due to difficulties in its early diagnosis. We analyzed the characteristics of retinal arteries to add a valuable technology for helping the normal tension glaucoma (NTG) diagnosis.||||This study included 51 patients with newly diagnosed NTG with hemifield defects and 60 age-matched controls. Peripapillary retinal arteriolar calibers (PRACs) photoed by non-mydriatic retinal camera were measured using ImageJ by two masked readers. We also performed spectral-domain optical coherence tomography to evaluate retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) and optic disc parameters. Their relations to retinal arteriolar calibers were investigated by univariate and multivariate linear regression. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to confirm the powers to detect NTG by PRACs.||||PRACs in four quadrants were significantly reduced in individuals with first diagnosed NTG (82 ± 15.1 μm, 80 ± 13.6 μm, 71 ± 11.6 μm, and 64 ± 10.0 μm) compared with those in age-matched controls (101 ± 9.8 μm, 105 ± 8.7 μm, 90 ± 7.5 μm, and 82 ± 9.8 μm). Superotemporal and inferotemporal PRACs in the visual field-affected hemifield were narrower than those in the unaffected hemifield in NTG group (P ≤ 0.004). Temporal PRACs in the RNFL unaffected hemifield were significantly narrower than in healthy eyes (P < 0.001). Superotemporal PRAC showed a significant correlation with superior RNFLT (β = 0.659, P < 0.001), and a similar relationship was found between inferotemporal PRAC and inferior RNFLT (β = 0.227, P = 0.015). The diagnostic capability of temporal PRACs was satisfactory (superotemporal PRAC; AUROC 0.983, cut-off value 84.7 μm, inferotemporal PRAC; AUROC 0.946, cut-off value 94.2 μm).||||PRAC and inferotemporal PRAC are valid parameters for discriminating patients with NTG.

Postsurgical Evaluation of Secondary Nephrogenic Hyperparathyroidism.tParathyroidectomy is useful for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) caused by chronic renal failure. The following three types of parathyroidectomy can be performed: subtotal parathyroidectomy, total parathyroidectomy and total parathyroidectomy plus autologous transplantation (tPTX+AT). Each of the three types of surgery has advantages and disadvantages. The present study retrospectively analyzed the efficacy of tPTX+AT for the treatment of SHPT over 1 year. Thirty-seven patients who were diagnosed with secondary nephrogenic hyperparathyroidism and treated with tPTX+AT were selected between September 2014 and October 2016 and followed up for 1 year. Their average age was 66.5±46.0 years, and the average time of dialysis was 48.1±8.2 months. The patients' conditions, including the levels of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and bone metabolism, were compared preoperatively and 1 and 7 days and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. In addition, the postoperative complications, pathological data, SHPT recurrence and prognosis were examined. The results showed that the postoperative level of ostalgia and cutaneous pruritus significantly decreased in the patients. An inspection of the parathyroid tissues during the operation confirmed the presence of parathyroid gland hyperplasia with no carcinoma detected. Three patients with hoarseness recovered within 1 month, and 1 patient with unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury improved after 6 months of voice training. Compared to the preoperative condition, the postoperative serum iPTH, serum calcium and serum phosphate levels were significantly decreased (P<0.001), and these differences remained significant 12 months after surgery. Compared to the preoperative condition, the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) concentration was decreased on postoperative day 1 (P<0.05), but no differences were observed on day 7 or at 1 month (P>0.05). The ALP levels continuously decreased at 3, 6 and 12 months (P<0.01). In conclusion, tPTX+AT significantly improves the quality of life and serum biomarker levels of these patients. The convenient surgical removal of the hyperplastic parathyroid gland for postoperative recurrence supports tPTX+AT as the recommended treatment for relevant patients.

The mean of age of the cases was 60.2 years. 60% were male. 95.4% were NENs G1. 17 cases of NENs had metastasis. 80% of SPM were recognized in the GIT (36% in stomach, 27% in large intestine, 11.2% in small intestine, and 5.6% in esophagus). The most common type of SPM was adenocarcinoma (49.4%), followed by GIST (13.5%), other NENs in different GIT segment (7.9%), lymphoma (6.8%), and squamous cell carcinoma (4.5%). The most common tumor in GIT was adenocarcinoma (97.6%) and the presence of adenocarcinoma in the same segment of GIT was found in 68.4% of the cases. Association between adenocarcinomas and NENs in GIT (p:<0.0001) and adenocarcinoma and tumor in the same segment of GIT location were observed (p<0.001).||||These results demonstrate that NENs with SPM are not a rare condition. Several theories have been proposed to explain this association; one of these is the ability of NENs to generate synchronous tumors by autocrine and paracrine effect. We observed an association between adenocarcinomas and NENs in the same segment of GIT.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance feature tracking strain analysis for discrimination between hypertensive heart disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.tHypertensive heart disease (HHD) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are both associated with an increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness. Whilst LV ejection fraction is frequently normal in both, LV strain assessment could differentiate between the diseases. We sought to establish if cardiovascular magnetic resonance myocardial feature tracking (CMR-FT), an emerging method allowing accurate assessment of myocardial deformation, differentiates between both diseases. Additionally, CMR assessment of fibrosis and LV hypertrophy allowed association analyses and comparison of diagnostic capacities.||||Two-hundred twenty-four consecutive subjects (53 HHD, 107 HCM, and 64 controls) underwent 1.5T CMR including native myocardial T1 mapping and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Global longitudinal strain (GLS) was assessed by CMR-FT (CVi42, Circle Cardiovascular Imaging Inc.).||||GLS was significantly higher in HCM patients (-14.7±3.8 vs. -16.5±3.3% [HHD], P = 0.004; or vs. -17.2±2.0% [controls], P<0.001). GLS was associated with LV mass index (HHD, R = 0.419, P = 0.002; HCM, R = 0.429, P<0.001), and LV ejection fraction (HHD, R = -0.493, P = 0.002; HCM, R = -0.329, P<0.001). In HCM patients, GLS was also associated with global native T1 (R = 0.282, P = 0.003), and LGE volume (ρ = 0.380, P<0.001). Discrimination between HHD and HCM by GLS (c = 0.639, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.550-0.729) was similar to LV mass index (c = 0.643, 95% CI 0.556-0.731), global myocardial native T1 (c = 0.718, 95% CI 0.638-0.799), and LGE volume (c = 0.680, 95% CI 0.585-0.775).||||CMR-FT GLS differentiates between HHD and HCM. In HCM patients GLS is associated with myocardial fibrosis. The discriminatory capacity of CMR-FT GLS is similar to LV hypertrophy and fibrosis imaging markers.

Segmental Distribution of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Correlates with Microvascular Invasion in Liver Explants Undergoing Transplantation.tMicrovascular invasion (MVI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is a poor prognostic factor after liver transplantation and/or resection. Any correlation between MVI and segmental location of HCC has yet to be studied. Our aim is to evaluate the segmental location of HCC and any correlation with the presence of MVI, portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in explanted livers, and the recurrence of HCC after transplantation. Another objective of the study is to assess the treatment history (ablation or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)) and size of the tumor with respect to the risk of MVI.||||A single center, retrospective chart review, including 98 HCC patients, aged 18 years and older who had liver transplantation in our institute between 2012 and 2017. We reviewed the radiological images of the HCC tumors, the pathological findings of the explanted livers, and the follow-up imaging after transplantation.||||98 patients with the diagnosis of HCC underwent liver transplantation between 2012 and 2017. The mean age of the cohort was 63 ± 8.2. Males represented 75% and Caucasian race represented 75% of the cohort. The most common etiology of cirrhosis was chronic hepatitis C virus infection followed by alcohol abuse and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with percentages of 50%, 23%, and 10%, respectively. Microvascular invasion was found in 16% of the patients while PVT and the recurrence of HCC were found in 17% and 6 % of the cohort, respectively. MVI was found in 10 single HCC and 6 multifocal HCC. Right lobe HCC had more MVI when compared to the left and multilobar HCC, with percentages of 11%, 2%, and 3%, respectively. Localization of HCC in segment 8 was associated with the highest percentage of MVI when compared to all other segments. The risk of MVI in segment 8 HCC was 3.5 times higher than the risk from the other segments (p=0.002) while no vascular invasion was found in segments 1, 3, and 5. The risk of vascular invasion in untreated HCC is 3 times the risk in treated HCC (P=0.03).||||Our data indicate that the risk of microvascular invasion is highest in tumors localized to segment 8. The size and number of HCC tumors were not associated with an increased risk of microvascular invasion.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during remission induction chemotherapy: a single-center retrospective study.tThis study investigated the clinical characteristics, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, MRI follow-up, and prognosis of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) during remission induction chemotherapy.||||We analyzed the age, gender, PRES symptoms and signs, cranial MRI findings, therapeutic effect, and prognosis of children with ALL who developed PRES during chemotherapy from January 2010 to December 2013 at the Hematology Oncology Center of Beijing Children's Hospital. Changes in cranial MRI findings were analyzed, and intelligence (IQ) and cognitive function were evaluated using the Wechsler Scale and the Wisconsin Card Score Test after the children completed chemotherapy.||||There were 850 children with newly diagnosed ALL in this period; 13 (1.5%), 6 boys and 7 girls, developed PRES. All were diagnosed as B-cell ALL. The median age at PRES onset was 7 years (2-11 years). The median day of PRES onset was day 28 (day 17-34) of remission induction chemotherapy. Of the 13 children with PRES onset and seizures, 4 had visual disturbances and 2 had consciousness disturbances. Cranial MRI showed hyperintensity in the subcortical white matter on T2-weighted axial and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. The lesion locations were as follows: occipital lobe, 12 (92.3%) patients; frontal lobe, 7 (53.8%) patients; temporal lobe, 5 (38.4%) patients; parietal lobe, 3 (23.1%) patients; and cerebellum, 1 (7.7%) patient. There were 8 (61.5%) patients with vasogenic edema and 5 (38.5%) with cytotoxic edema. After treatment, all children recovered within one month,when their PRES symtoms were relieved, they continued to receive chemotherapy. However, 1 child (1.07%) died of severecentral nervous system infection one year after PRES treatment, and 3 (25%) had recurrent seizures and were diagnosed with epilepsy after three months of PRES treatment. Their cranial MRIs showed cytotoxic edema, which was acute stage on day 15, with aggravated lesions on cranial MRI. The cranial MRI lesions returned to normal at one month in 3 (23.1%) patients, at three months in 6 (46.1%) patients, at one year in 8 (61.5%) patients, and at two years in 12 (92.3%) patients. The 12 surviving children all returned to school, and their full-scale, verbal, and performance IQs were normal, with no significant differences in intelligence or cognitive function compared with children with ALL without PRES during the same period.||||PRES can occur during remission induction chemotherapy treatment of children with ALL, but the incidence is low. Cranial MRI can be used for diagnosis and to characterize lesions. The children recover about a month after treatment, and cranial MRI lesions return to normal within two years. The time for complete resolution of MRI lesions differs, and children with cytotoxic edema have worse prognosis with sequelae, such as epilepsy, which requires close monitoring. PRES does not affect intelligence or cognitive development.

This study explores the association between F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and tumor histology in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) recipients and their outcome.||||Two hundred fifty-eight patients with primary liver tumors who underwent FDG-PET before LDLT were enrolled in this retrospective study. Unfavorable tumor histology was defined as primary liver tumor other than a well- or moderately differentiated HCC. Thirteen patients had unfavorable tumor histology, including 2 poorly differentiated HCC, 2 sarcomatoid HCC, 5 combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma, 3 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 1 hilar cholangiocarcinoma.||||FDG-PET positivity was significantly associated with unfavorable tumor histology (P < 0.001). Both FDG-PET positivity and unfavorable tumor histology were significant independent predictors of tumor recurrence and overall survival. In a subgroup analysis of patients with FDG-PET-positive tumors, unfavorable tumor histology was a significant independent predictor of tumor recurrence and overall survival. High FDG uptake (tumor to non-tumor uptake ratio ≥ 2) was a significant predictor of unfavorable tumor histology. Patients with high FDG uptake and/or unfavorable tumors had significantly higher 3-year cumulative recurrence rate (70.8% versus 26.2%, P = 0.004) and worse 3-year overall survival (34.1% versus 70.8%, P = 0.012) compared to those with low FDG uptake favorable tumors.||||The expression of FDG-PET is highly associated with histology of explanted HCC and predicts the recurrence. FDG-PET-positive tumors with high FDG uptake may be considered contraindication for LDLT due to high recurrence rate except when pathology proves favorable histology.

Plasma proteome plus site-specific N-glycoprofiling for hepatobiliary carcinomas.tHepatobiliary cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Appropriate markers for early diagnosis, monitoring of disease progression, and prediction of postsurgical outcome are still lacking. As the majority of circulating N-glycoproteins are originated from the hepatobiliary system, we sought to explore new markers by assessing the dynamics of N-glycoproteome in plasma samples from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), or combined HCC and CCA (cHCC-CCA). Using a mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic approach, we found that 57 of 5358 identified plasma proteins were differentially expressed in hepatobiliary cancers. The levels of four essential proteins, including complement C3 and apolipoprotein C-III in HCC, galectin-3-binding protein in CCA, and 72 kDa inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase in cHCC-CCA, were highly correlated with tumor stage, tumor grade, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival. Postproteomic site-specific N-glycan analyses showed that human complement C3 bears high-mannose and hybrid glycoforms rather than complex glycoforms at Asn85. The abundance of complement C3 with mannose-5 or mannose-6 glycoform at Asn85 was associated with HCC tumor grade. Furthermore, stepwise Cox regression analyses revealed that HCC patients with a hybrid glycoform at Asn85 of complement C3 had a lower postsurgery tumor recurrence rate or mortality rate than those with a low amount of complement C3 protein. In conclusion, our data show that particular plasma N-glycoproteins with specific N-glycan compositions could be potential noninvasive markers to evaluate oncological status and prognosis of hepatobiliary cancers.

Hereditary or Not? Understanding Serrated Polyposis Syndrome.tTo present the current understanding of the diagnosis, management, and potential genetic causes of serrated polyposis syndrome.||||The clinical criteria for serrated polyposis syndrome was recently updated and now includes individuals with five or more serrated polyps proximal to the rectum that are 5 mm in size or greater and at least two that are 10 mm in size of greater as well as individuals with 20 or more serrated polyps throughout the colon with at least five proximal to the rectum. There is a significant risk for colon cancer in first-degree relatives of individuals with serrated polyposis syndrome. However, less than 3% of serrated polyposis syndrome cases are explained by identifiable germline mutations, with mutations in RNF43 being the only currently validated genetic cause. Serrated polyposis syndrome is rarely explained by identifiable germline mutations, but there remains an increased risk for colorectal cancer in first-degree relatives. Referral for genetic counseling and testing is recommended for individuals with serrated polyposis syndrome and a personal history of coexisting adenomatous polyposis or with a concerning family history and can be considered for all individuals with serrated polyposis syndrome. Close endoscopic surveillance of those with serrated polyposis syndrome and their first-degree relatives is recommended.

In the early stage of AD, amyloid β-induced synapse changes is the main reason, while in the later stage, the accumulation of Tau protein promotes synapse degeneration as the key factor leading to dementia. MicroRNA (miRNA) is closely related to the expression changes of many AD-related genes. One of the most abundant brain-enriched miRNAs is miR-132, which has been shown to regulate both neuron morphogenesis and plasticity. It has been reported that miR-132 is significantly reduced in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Genetic deletion of miR-132 in mice promotes Aβ deposition, leading to impaired memory and enhanced Tau pathology, but how the miRNA-mediated gene expression dysregulation contributes to AD pathology remains unclear. Here we found the possible downstream target of miR-132 by in silico analysis, namely C1q. C1q is the primary protein of classical complement cascade, which is highly expressed in the synaptic regions of the central nervous system in Alzheimer's patients. However, it is not clear whether miR-132 plays a role in AD through regulating C1q. To address this question, the APP/PS1 transgenic mice were transfected with miR-132 and given C1 inhibitors. Behavior tests were conducted to assess memory and cognitive abilities seven days after administration. In addition, we analyzed the expression of PSD95, Synapsin-1 and phosphorylated (p)-Synapsin. We found that the expression levels of the synaptic proteins treated with miR-132 or C1INH were significantly increased compared with the AD group. Further RT-qPCR result suggested that miR-132 might regulate C1q expression in AD.

A comparison of the risk of congestive heart failure-related hospitalizations in patients receiving hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis - A retrospective propensity score-matched study.tCongestive heart failure (CHF) is associated with high mortality and a heavy financial and healthcare burden in the dialysis population. Determining which dialysis modality is associated with a higher risk of developing CHF might facilitate clinical decision making and surveillance programs in the dialysis population.||||Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database, we recruited all incident dialysis patients during the period from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2010. The propensity score matching method was applied to establish the matched hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) cohort. Incidence rates and cumulative incidence rates of CHF-related hospitalization were first compared for the HD and PD patients. Multivariable subdistribution hazards models were then constructed to control for potential confounders.||||Among a total of 65,899 enrolled dialysis patients, 4,754 matched pairs of HD and PD patients were identified. The incidence rates of CHF in the matched HD and PD patients were 25.98 and 19.71 per 1000 patient-years, respectively (P = 0.001). The cumulative incidence rate of CHF was also higher in the matched HD patients (0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI)(0.12-0.21)] than in the corresponding PD patients (0.09, 95% CI [0.08-0.11])(P<0.0001). HD was consistently associated with an increased subdistribution hazard ratio (HR) of CHF compared with PD in the matched cohort (HR: 1.45, 95% CI [1.23-1.7]). Similar phenomenons were observed in either the subgroup analysis stratified by selected confounders or in the HD and PD group without matching.||||HD is associated with a higher risk of developing CHF-related hospitalization than PD. The surveillance program for CHF should differ in patients receiving different dialysis modalities.

Mice with an autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2O disease mutation in both dynein alleles display severe moto-sensory phenotypes.tCharcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is the most common peripheral neuromuscular disorder worldwide. The axonal degeneration in CMT causes distal muscle weakness and atrophy, resulting in gait problems and difficulties with basic motor coordination skills. A mutation in the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain (DHC) gene was discovered to cause an autosomal dominant form of the disease designated Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2O disease (CMT2O) in 2011. The mutation is a single amino acid change of histidine into arginine at amino acid 306 (H306R) in DHC. We previously generated a knock-in mouse carrying the corresponding CMT2O mutation (H304R) and examined the heterozygous H304R/+offspring in a variety of motor skills and histological assays. Here we report the initial characterization of the homozygous H304R/R mouse, which is the first homozygous mutant DHC mouse to survive past the neonatal stage. We show that H304R/R mice have significantly more severe disease symptoms than the heterozygous H304R/+mice. The H304R/R mice have significant defects in motor skills, including grip strength, motor coordination, and gait and also related defects in neuromuscular junction architecture. Furthermore, the mice have defects in sensation, another aspect of CMT disease. Our results show that the H304R/+ and H304R/R mice will be important models for studying the onset and progression of both heterozygous and homozygous CMT disease alleles.

Antenatal active maternal asthma and other atopic disorders is associated with ADHD behaviors among school-aged children.tIdentifying modifiable risk factors for neuropsychological correlates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in early childhood can inform prevention strategies. Prenatal inflammatory states, such as maternal asthma and other atopic disorders, have been increasingly linked to enhanced risk for neurobehavioral disorders in children, with some studies suggesting sex-specific effects.||||To assess the association between maternal active asthma and/or atopy in the antenatal period and child symptoms of ADHD during mid-childhood and, given the male-bias in ADHD prevalence, to examine modifying effects of child sex.||||The study sample includes 250 maternal-child pairs enrolled in the Boston-based Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment and Social Stress (ACCESS) pregnancy cohort. We defined antenatal active atopy based on maternal report of current asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis during and/or in the year before pregnancy. When children were approximately 6 years old, mothers completed a battery of standardized child behavior rating scales designed for evaluating symptoms of ADHD. We used multivariable quantile regression to assess the relations between maternal antenatal atopy and symptoms of ADHD among children.||||In adjusted models, maternal atopy was significantly associated with greater risk for ADHD behaviors, as indicated by scores on the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised ADHD index (β = 3.32, 95% CI: 0.33, 6.32). In sex-stratified models this association was stronger among girls (5.96, 95% CI = 0.95, 10.96) compared to boys (-2.14, 95% CI = -5.75, 1.45, p-interaction = 0.01). Among girls, we observed a similar finding for the Behavior Assessment System for Children 2nd Edition Parent Rating Scale Attention Problems subscale (β = 7.77, 95% CI = 1.57, 13.97). Results from other outcome subscales were similar in magnitude and direction, however, associations did not reach statistical significance at the p = 0.05 level.||||Maternal antenatal active atopy may be a risk factor for the development of ADHD-like symptoms, especially among girls.

Late recurrence of gastric cancer in the ovary and uterine cervix.tUterine cervical metastasis from gastric cancer is relatively rare. This is a report of an extremely rare instance of concurrent late gastric-cancer recurrence to the left ovary and the uterine cervix, 11 years after initial treatment. A 53-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with continuous abdominal pain and genital bleeding. Eleven years prior, she had been treated for gastric cancer, pathologically confirmed as stage II poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cell carcinoma (pT2N1M0). Magnetic resonance imaging results showed a solid mass in the left ovary, about 8 cm in diameter, fixed to the enlarged uterus and displaying slightly high intensity on T1-weighted images and uneven low intensity and enhanced hypervascular areas on T2-weighted images. Cervical biopsy revealed small, round, spindle-shaped tumor cells beneath a normal cervical epithelium. When we did the immunohistochemistry tests, the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 5.2, cytokeratin anion exchange protein 1/3, and cytokeratin 7; the cells were negative for cytokeratin 20 and paired-box gene (PAX) 8. This marker pattern was the same as that of her previous gastric cancer; therefore, the tumors of the cervix and left ovary were diagnosed as metastatic gastric cancer. After obtaining informed consent, the patient received transarterial chemoembolization using cisplatin and, subsequently, underwent a modified radical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Pathological examination revealed an infiltrative pattern with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and signet-ring cell carcinoma. The patient received combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and S-1, and she is currently alive 12 months after surgery with no evidence of recurrence. Late recurrence more than 10 years after treatment for primary gastric cancer is extremely rare. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of metastasis from extrapelvic carcinomas, even in patients treated many years prior to presentation.

Treatment of idiopathic choroidal neovascular membrane with ranibizumab - our experience.tTo evaluate the anatomical and functional outcome of ranibizumab therapy in patients with idiopathic choroidal neovascularization (CNV). File and Methodology: The group consists of 6 patients. Patients were older 18 years but they were under 50 years of age. The monitoring period lasted 12 months. We confirmed active idiopathic CNV in subfoveal position with fluorescein angiography (FAg) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). The activity of idiopathic CNV we demonstrated with leakage of dye by FAg examination. The presence of serous retinal pigment epithelium detachment and / or subretinal fluid and / or intraretinal edema in the form of intraretinal cysts demonstrated activity of CNV on OCT scans. A decrease of the visual acuity under 85 letters was observed at the ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) visual acuity chart. After the initial administration of ranibizumab a pro re nata regimen was used. We indicated repeated injection of ranibizumab in patients with signs of activity of idiopathic CNV on OCT scans or by FAg. Also we indicated repeated injection of ranibizumab in patients with new loss of visual acuity on the ETDRS visual acuity chart connected with signs of activity of CNV on OCT scans or by FAg.||||On average, we observed the gain of +11 letters on the ETDRS visual acuity chart after 12 months of the follow-up period. On average we observed reduction of central macular thickness -233&#956;m. At the 12th month of follow-up we observed in all patients of our group only inactive scar without exudation. No serous retinal pigment eithelium detachment, subretinal fluid or intraretinal cysts were observed. Only 3 injections of ranibizumab were administered on average to each patient during the 12 months of the follow-up period.||||In our study, we observed the positive effect of ranibizumab on the course of idiopathic CNV. With ranibizumab treatment we achieved regression of CNV with resorption of macular edema in all patients of our group. With the disappearance of the activity of idiopathic CNV ranibizumab gives real hope to improve visual acuity.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the association between FH and PCa in a Chinese biopsy cohort.||||Consecutive patients who received 10 to 12 core systematic prostate biopsies from April 2013 to October 2018 in three medical centers were enrolled in this study. Demographic information and clinical information were obtained through prebiopsy questionnaire, including cancer FH, age, and total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA).||||Of 2321 patients, 83 (3.6%) were reported a FH of PCa. The positive biopsy rate in these patients was 54.2%, significantly higher than the patients without the family history of PCa (42.6%; relative risk [RR] = 1.27; P =  .024). In patients with positive FH of breast cancer gene (BRCA)-related cancers (breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer, n = 154), 74 (48.1%) were diagnosed as PCa, higher than those without FH (42.7%; RR = 1.13; P =  .112). Multivariate logistic regression analysis (after adjusting for age and tPSA values) showed that there was 2.1-fold increased risk of PCa in patients with positive FH of PCa (P =  .005), and 1.6-fold increased risk in patients with positive FH of BRCA-related cancers (P =  .019). However, there was no significant association between FH of PCa or BRCA-related cancer and high-grade PCa after adjusting age and tPSA level (P =  .404 for PCa, P =  0.991 for BRCA-related cancers).||||Patients with positive FH of PCa had 2.1-fold higher risk of PCa, and patients with positive FH of BRCA-related cancers had 1.6-fold higher risk in this biopsy cohort of Chinese population. Patients with positive FH of PCa or BRCA-related cancers would have earlier age at onset of PCa.

Cancer Stem Cells and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in Cancer Metastasis.tThe cancer stem cell (CSC) concept stands for undifferentiated tumor cells with the ability to initiate heterogeneous tumors. It is also relevant in metastasis and can explain how metastatic tumors mirror the heterogeneity of primary tumors. Cellular plasticity, including the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enables the generation of CSCs at different steps of the metastatic process including metastatic colonization. In this review, we update the concept of CSCs and provide evidence of the existence of metastatic stem cells (MetSCs). In addition, we highlight the nuanced understanding of EMT that has been gained recently and the association of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) with the acquisition of CSCs properties during metastasis. We also comment on the computational approaches that have profoundly influenced our understanding of CSCs and EMT; and how these studies and new experimental technologies can yield a deeper understanding of the biological aspects of metastasis.

Non-Pharmacological Therapeutic Options for Liver Metastases in Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors.tThe incidence of liver metastasis in digestive neuroendocrine tumors is high. Their presence appears as an important prognostic factor in terms of quality of life and survival. These tumors may be symptomatic because of the tumor burden itself and/or the hormonal hyper-secretion induced by the tumor. Surgery is the treatment of choice for resectable tumors and metastasis. Nevertheless, surgery is only possible in a small number of cases. The management of non-resectable liver metastasis is a challenge. The literature is rich but consists predominantly in small retrospective series with a low level of proof. Thus, the choice of one technique over another could be difficult. Local ablative techniques (radiofrequency) or trans-catheter intra-arterial liver-directed treatments (hepatic artery embolization, chemo-embolization, and radio-embolization) are frequently considered for liver metastasis. In the present review, we focus on these different therapeutic approaches in advanced neuroendocrine tumors, results (clinical and radiological), and overall efficacy, and summarize recommendations to help physicians in their clinical practice.

Prenatal diagnosis of Pallister-Killian syndrome using cord blood samples.tPallister-Killian syndrome (PKS) (OMIM:#601803) is a rare sporadic genetic disorder characterized by multi-malformations which is caused by the presence of the extra isochromosome 12p. PKS is featured by the tissue-limited mosaicism of the isochromosome 12p [i(12p)]. There were a wide spectrum of prenatal ultrasound findings of PKS, which made it difficult to be found in first or second trimester. Polyhydramnios, diaphragmatic hernia, and rhizomelic limb shortening were the most common prenatal ultrasound abnormalities in PKS. This study retrospectively analyzed the ultrasound findings and molecular cytogenetic results of four PKS fetuses diagnosed by using cord blood samples.||||The ultrasound anomalies of four PKS fetuses are described as follows: fetal macrosomia, cerebral ventriculomegaly, increased NT thickness, rhizomelic limbs shortening, polyhydramnios. Biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC), femur length (FL) measurements were above the mean in three fetuses,while one fetus showed rhizomelic limbs shortening. Combined with this study and previous literature, polyhydramnios was the most frequent anomaly observed in prenatal ultrasound examination of PKS, which accounted for 48% (94/194). Fetal macrosomia was present in 15% (29/194), cerebral ventriculomegaly in 13% (25/194), thickened nuchal fold in 9% (18/194), rhizomelic limbs shortening in 26% (51/194). I(12p) was found in the karyotype analysis of cultured cord blood lymphocytes and the mosaic ratios ranged from 2 to 5%. Single nucleotide polymorphisms array (SNP-array) results suggested that the whole short arm of chromosome 12 was duplicated with 2~3 copies. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed to confirm the results of karyotype and SNP-array.||||In case non-specific indicators such as fetal macrosomia, polyhydramnios and rhizomelic limbs shortening are observed meanwhile in prenatal ultrasound, targeted detection of PKS should be considered. In the prenatal diagnosis of PKS, the combination of SNP-array and FISH with conventional karyotype are the key to seek i(12p) and for precise diagnosis.

Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase in nonmelanoma skin cancers.tSquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) represent the most common forms of nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs). Although successful treatment of these neoplasms is based on surgical excision, an increasing number of BCCs relapses and many SCCs display high rates of recurrence and metastasis. Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is a cytosolic enzyme, which was found to be upregulated in different solid tumours. However, there are no data regarding enzyme expression in NMSCs. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the potential involvement of NNMT in BCCs and SCCs.||||Immunohistochemical analyses were carried out on 40 BCC cases and 39 SCC cases, to evaluate enzyme expression in tumour and surrounding healthy margins. Moreover, the relationship between NNMT intratumour levels and clinico-pathological parameters were explored.||||Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase was found to be overexpressed in BCCs compared with control tissues, while a significant enzyme downregulation was detected in SCCs with respect to corresponding healthy margins. In addition, NNMT levels were negatively related to aggressiveness of both BCCs (distinguishing between infiltrative and nodular tumours) and SCCs (considering head and neck forms and tumours of the extremities and trunk).||||These evidences seem to demonstrate that the different NNMT dysregulation detected in BCC and SCC may be the result of important biological traits distinctively characterizing these two forms within NMSCs. In addition, enzyme levels seem to be inversely correlated with tumour aggressiveness, thus suggesting the potential suitability of the enzyme as a prognostic biomarker for both neoplasms.

Association of Intracranial Artery Calcification with Cognitive Impairment in Hemodialysis Patients.tBACKGROUND Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of risk factors for dementia and cognitive decline. Cardiovascular and dialysis-related factors might also be involved in the mechanism of cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients. The objective of this study was to investigate whether cardiovascular risk factors including intracranial artery calcification and dialysis-related factors such as fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) might be associated with cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional observational study included patients receiving in-center hemodialysis over 6 months at our hospital. All patients underwent non-contrast computed tomography (CT) examinations. Internal carotid artery (ICA) calcium scores were measured using the Agatston method. The Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was used for measurement of cognitive function at each study visit. Serum concentrations of FGF23, osteoprotegerin, and klotho were analyzed using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. RESULTS This study included 69 patients. Cognitive impairment was observed in 22 patients (31.9%), including 3 patients with dementia. ICA calcium score in patients with cognitive impairment was higher than that in those without cognitive impairment (177.3 versus 87.6, P=0.022). Intracranial artery calcification was significantly associated with cognitive impairment after adjusting for FGF23 and 25-OH vitamin D, but not significant after adjusting for age, FGF23, and 25-OH vitamin D. Low level of FGF23 was associated with cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS Intracranial artery calcification and low FGF23 could be associated with cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients. Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate whether intracranial artery calcification and FGF23 could affect cognitive function of hemodialysis patients.

Follow-up after focal therapy of the prostate with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) using contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in combination with MRI image fusion.tFocal therapy (FT) of the prostate for low risk prostate cancer (PCa) is an alternative to traditional definite treatment options like external beam radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy. However, follow up after FT is still challenging and is subject to current studies. Significance of imaging after FT such as multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is currently not well established. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of alternative imaging during the follow up of low risk PCa treated with focal HIFU therapy using CEUS and image fusion.||||Retrospective single arm study in patients with uni- or bilateral, low or intermediate risk prostate cancer treated with HIFU at our institution between October 2016 and January 2018. CEUS in combination with image fusion using an axial T2-weighted MRI sequence was performed during follow up 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the therapy.||||4 consecutive patients with Gleason score (GS) 6 and 4 patients with GS 7a prostate cancer were included in the study. Hemiablation was performed in 7 patients with unilateral tumor. One patient underwent whole gland treatment due to histological proven bilateral PCa. Mean patient age at time of therapy was 70.3 (54-83) years and mean Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level prior treatment was 7.8 ng/ml (2.1-14.4), after 3 months mean PSA level was 3.9 ng/ml (0.1-7.2), after 6 months 3.5 ng/ml (0.2-6.0), after 9 months 3.1 ng/ml (0.2-6.8) and 3.3 ng/ml (0.2-6.1) after 12 months. CEUS showed no signs of microvascularisation after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months in the ablated zone. 3 months posttreatment the necrotic tissue was still visible in the B-mode scan, although with no signs of vascularization performing CEUS. After 6 months the ablated side of the prostate was almost completely atrophic. And after 9 months the necrotic tissue was completely resolved. Between 9 and 12 months no changes in microvascularisation and perfusion could be shown.||||MpMRI/CEUS image fusion is a cost-effective and feasible technique to monitor the perfusion of the ablation zone after focal therapy of the prostate.

Prevalence and Preliminary Validation of Screening Criteria to Identify Carriers of Germline BAP1 Mutations.tInherited mutations are easily detected factors that influence the disease courses and optimal treatment strategies of some cancers. Germline mutations in BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1) are associated with unique disease profiles in mesothelioma, atypical spitz nevi, and uveal melanoma, but the patient characteristics of an unselected population of BAP1 carriers identified by an ascertainment prevalence study are unknown.||||We collected blood samples, cancer histories, and occupational exposures from 183 unselected patients with BAP1-related diseases. Clinical information for each patient was obtained from medical records. Germline DNA was extracted from blood samples and sequenced using a next-generation sequencing assay. We tested screening criteria developed to identify patients with a possible germline BAP1 mutation.||||Pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline BAP1 mutations were observed in 5 of 180 sequenced specimens and were exclusively found in patients identified by our screening criteria. Several patients with characteristics suspicious for a heritable deleterious mutation did not have a germline BAP1 mutation. The prevalence of pathogenic germline BAP1 mutations in patients with mesothelioma was 4.4% (95% confidence interval 1.1-11.1).||||Results from the first unselected prevalence ascertainment study of germline BAP1 alterations suggest that the frequency of this mutation is low among patients with mesothelioma. The proposed screening criteria successfully identified all patients with germline BAP1-mutant mesothelioma. These screening guidelines may assist physicians in selecting patients who would benefit from genetic testing. Future efforts should validate and refine these criteria and search for other germline mutations associated with mesothelioma and related diseases.

Current status of the adjuvant therapy in uterine sarcoma: A literature review.tUterine sarcomas (US) are rare mesenchymal tumours accounting approximately for 3%-7% of all uterine cancers. Histologically, US are classified into mesenchymal tumours or mixed epithelial and mesenchymal tumours. The group of mesenchymal tumours includes uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS, 65% of cases), endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS, 21%) - traditionally divided into low grade (LG-ESS) and high grade-undifferentiated uterine sarcoma (5%) and other rare subtypes such as alveolar or embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. Despite the fact that several drugs demonstrated clinical activity in advanced or metastatic settings, the role of postoperative therapy in US remains controversial. In this review, we have summarised the current state of the art, including the chief trials on adjuvant treatment modalities in US, especially focusing on uLMS, LG-ESS and other rare histotypes.

Primary Angiitis of the Central Nervous System Mimicking Glioblastoma: A Case Report and Literature Review.tPrimary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is a rare disorder resulting in idiopathic inflammation affecting the parenchymal and leptomeningeal vessels confined to the central nervous system (CNS), of which a tumor-like mass lesion is an even rare subtype. We described a case of PACNS initially misdiagnosed as glioblastoma. The patient was a 35 year-old female with right-sided weakness and expressive dysphasia. Brain MRI showed a tumor-like lesion highly suggestive of glioblastoma, therefor surgical removal was done. After a resection and an exhaustive workup, PACNS was ultimately diagnosed. The case illustrates a type of imaging presentation of PACNS that is often misdiagnosed as high-grade glioma. Differentiation between tumor-like PACNS lesions and actual CNS tumors is challenging due to similar MR images. To avoid unnecessary surgical interventions, we summarized previously reported mass-forming PACNS cases in adults from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2018 and the imaging characteristics of PACNS. Some less commonly used diagnostic methods such as MR spectroscopy may also help clinicians distinguish PACNS from its mimics.

TuBA: Tunable biclustering algorithm reveals clinically relevant tumor transcriptional profiles in breast cancer.tTraditional clustering approaches for gene expression data are not well adapted to address the complexity and heterogeneity of tumors, where small sets of genes may be aberrantly co-expressed in specific subsets of tumors. Biclustering algorithms that perform local clustering on subsets of genes and conditions help address this problem. We propose a graph-based Tunable Biclustering Algorithm (TuBA) based on a novel pairwise proximity measure, examining the relationship of samples at the extremes of genes' expression profiles to identify similarly altered signatures.||||TuBA's predictions are consistent in 3,940 breast invasive carcinoma samples from 3 independent sources, using different technologies for measuring gene expression (RNA sequencing and Microarray). More than 60% of biclusters identified independently in each dataset had significant agreement in their gene sets, as well as similar clinical implications. Approximately 50% of biclusters were enriched in the estrogen receptor-negative/HER2-negative (or basal-like) subtype, while >50% were associated with transcriptionally active copy number changes. Biclusters representing gene co-expression patterns in stromal tissue were also identified in tumor specimens.||||TuBA offers a simple biclustering method that can identify biologically relevant gene co-expression signatures not captured by traditional unsupervised clustering approaches. It complements biclustering approaches that are designed to identify constant or coherent submatrices in gene expression datasets, and outperforms them in identifying a multitude of altered transcriptional profiles that are associated with observed genomic heterogeneity of diseased states in breast cancer, both within and across tumor subtypes, a promising step in understanding disease heterogeneity, and a necessary first step in individualized therapy.

[Osteoblastoma of the middle nasal concha: a rare tumor of the facial massif that should be taken into consideration].tOsteoblastoma is a rare benign bone tumor, accounting for 1% of all bone tumors. It mainly occurs in the long bones, more rarely in the jaws. Osteoblastoma of the jaws mainly involves the mandible while nasosinusal involvement is very rare. The diameter of the tumor can grow to 10 cm. On X-ray, the tumor may appear as a well or poorly defined clear lesion, usually scattered with mineral patches. Recurrence rate is very low after surgical resection as well as the risk of malignant transformation. We report the case of a 13-year old female patient presenting with nasal obstruction evolving over the last 3 months associated with episodes of epistaxis and left blurred vision. Clinical examination showed voluminous nasal concha with polyploid mucosa filling all the left nasal fossa with left axial exophthalmos. CT scan of the facial massif showed left frontoethmoidal expansive process measuring 50*47*36 mm, spontaneously hypodense, heterogeneous, non enhanced after injection of the Contrast materials, responsible for destruction of the ethmoidal labyrinth, swelling of the bony walls with mass effect on the ipsilateral orbit. The suspected diagnosis was frontoethmoidal mucocele. Hence, the decision to perform endonasal surgery. Whitish thick liquid was collected by the cranial portion of the middle nasal concha sugesting infected mucocele. Resection of the middle nasal concha was performed. The histological examination showed osteoblastoma of the middle nasal concha . Outcome was marked by regression of the exophthalmos with no recurrence during 1-year follow up period.

Plasma metabolite profiling reveals potential biomarkers of giant cell tumor of bone by using NMR-based metabolic profiles: A cross-sectional study.tGiant cell tumor (GCT) of bone is a locally aggressive bone tumor, which accounts for 4% to 5% of all primary bone tumors. At present, the early diagnosis and postoperative recurrence monitoring are still more difficult due to the lack of effective biomarkers in GCT. As an effective tool, metabolomics has played an essential role in the biomarkers research of many tumors. However, there has been no related study of the metabolomics of GCT up to now. The purpose of this study was to identify several key metabolites as potential biomarkers for GCT by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolic profiles.Patients with GCT in our hospital were recruited in this study and their plasma was collected as the research sample, and plasma collected from healthy subjects was considered as the control. NMR was then utilized to detect all samples. Furthermore, based on correlation coefficients, variable importance for the projection values and P values of metabolites obtained from multidimensional statistical analysis, the most critical metabolites were selected as potential biomarkers of GCT. Finally, relevant metabolic pathways involved in these potential biomarkers were determined by database retrieval, based on which the metabolic pathways were plotted.Finally, 28 GCT patients and 26 healthy volunteers agreed to participate in the study. In the multidimensional statistical analysis, all results showed that there was obvious difference between the GCT group and the control group. Ultimately, 18 metabolites with significant differences met the selection condition, which were identified as potential biomarkers. Through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Human Metabolome Database (HMD) database searching and literature review, these metabolites were found to be mainly correlated with glucose metabolism, fat metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and intestinal microbial metabolism. These metabolic disorders might, in turn, reflect important pathological processes such as proliferation and migration of tumor cells and immune escape in GCT.Our work showed that these potential biomarkers identified appeared to have early diagnostic and relapse monitoring values for GCT, which deserve to be further investigated. In addition, it also suggested that metabolomics profiling approach is a promising screening tool for the diagnosis and relapse monitoring of GCT patients.

A Nomogram to Predict Factors Associated with Lymph Node Metastasis in Ductal Carcinoma In Situ with Microinvasion.tDuctal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with foci of invasion measuring ≤ 1 mm (DCISM), represents < 1% of all invasive breast cancers. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been a standard component of surgery for patients with invasive carcinoma or extensive DCIS. We hypothesize that selective performance of SLNB may be appropriate given the low incidence of sentinel node (SN) metastasis for DCISM. We investigated the clinicopathologic predictors for SN positivity in DCISM, to identify which patients might benefit from SLNB.||||A retrospective review of the National Cancer Database was performed for cases from 2012 to 2015. Clinical and tumor characteristics, including SN results, were evaluated, and Pearson's Chi square tests and logistic regression were performed.||||Of 7803 patients with DCISM, 306 (4%) had at least one positive SN. Patients with positive SNs were younger, more often of Black race, had higher-grade histology and larger tumor size, and were more likely to have lymphovascular invasion (LVI; all p < 0.001). In an adjusted model, the presence of LVI was associated with the highest odds ratio (OR) for node positivity (OR 8.80, 95% confidence interval 4.56-16.96).||||Among women with DCISM, only 4% had a positive SN. Node positivity was associated with more extensive and higher-grade DCIS, and the presence of LVI was strongly correlated with node positivity. Our data suggest that LVI is the most important factor in determining which patients with DCISM will benefit from SN biopsy.

Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase in nonmelanoma skin cancers.tSquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) represent the most common forms of nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs). Although successful treatment of these neoplasms is based on surgical excision, an increasing number of BCCs relapses and many SCCs display high rates of recurrence and metastasis. Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is a cytosolic enzyme, which was found to be upregulated in different solid tumours. However, there are no data regarding enzyme expression in NMSCs. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the potential involvement of NNMT in BCCs and SCCs.||||Immunohistochemical analyses were carried out on 40 BCC cases and 39 SCC cases, to evaluate enzyme expression in tumour and surrounding healthy margins. Moreover, the relationship between NNMT intratumour levels and clinico-pathological parameters were explored.||||Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase was found to be overexpressed in BCCs compared with control tissues, while a significant enzyme downregulation was detected in SCCs with respect to corresponding healthy margins. In addition, NNMT levels were negatively related to aggressiveness of both BCCs (distinguishing between infiltrative and nodular tumours) and SCCs (considering head and neck forms and tumours of the extremities and trunk).||||These evidences seem to demonstrate that the different NNMT dysregulation detected in BCC and SCC may be the result of important biological traits distinctively characterizing these two forms within NMSCs. In addition, enzyme levels seem to be inversely correlated with tumour aggressiveness, thus suggesting the potential suitability of the enzyme as a prognostic biomarker for both neoplasms.

The combination of DNA methylation and gene expression data can improve the classification of tumor heterogeneity, by incorporating differences at the epigenetic level and clinical features.||||In this study, we identified the prognostic methylation and constructed specific prognosis-subgroups based on the DNA methylation spectrum of RCC from the TCGA database.||||Significant differences in DNA methylation profiles among the seven subgroups were revealed by consistent clustering using 3389 CpGs that indicated that were significant differences in prognosis. The specific DNA methylation patterns reflected differentially in the clinical index, including TNM classification, pathological grade, clinical stage, and age. In addition, 437 CpGs corresponding to 477 genes of 151 samples were identified as specific hyper/hypomethylation sites for each specific subgroup. A total of 277 and 212 genes corresponding to DNA methylation at promoter sites were enriched in transcription factor of GKLF and RREB-1, respectively. Finally, Bayesian network classifier with specific methylation sites was constructed and was used to verify the test set of prognoses into DNA methylation subgroups, which was found to be consistent with the classification results of the train set. DNA methylation-based classification can be used to identify the distinct subtypes of renal cell carcinoma.||||This study shows that DNA methylation-based classification is highly relevant for future diagnosis and treatment of renal cell carcinoma as it identifies the prognostic value of each epigenetic subtype.

Genomic Alterations in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors as Revealed by Conventional and Array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization.tGastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most commonly occurring mesenchymal neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract, accounting for 80 percent of these tumors. GIST is highly unresponsive to standard chemotherapy, particularly in patients with advanced or metastatic disease. Recent molecular studies have shown that activating c-kit (KIT) mutations are detectable in a large proportion (>75%) of tumors, between 78% (1) and 89% (2). Approximately 30% of tumors without an identifiable KIT mutation exhibit PDGFRA mutations (3). Furthermore, the KIT mutations are heterogeneous, some being known to confer a relatively better prognosis than others (1). Gross cytogenetic abnormalities associated with GIST appear to be similar regardless of whether a KIT mutation is identified. The molecular genetic alterations associated with multistep GIST tumorigenesis, particularly those which confer intrinsic or acquired resistance to both standard as well as targeted therapeutic approaches, however, are not fully recognized. As an initial approach to identify chromosomal sites of candidate gene(s), which may predict overall clinical and biologic behavior of GISTs, as they relate to response to the specific therapeutic drug Gleevec, we analyzed six GIST samples using both conventional as well as array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH). The common abnormalities detected by CGH in low and high grade tumors included loss of all or part of chromosome 14; an entire chromosome 14 was lost in four tumor samples, with the remaining two samples exhibiting loss of the 14q22-q32.3 region. Other recurrent abnormalities included loss of the 1p chromosomal region (four tumor samples), loss of part or entire chromosome 9 (only in metastatic tumors), loss of chromosomes 15 and 22, and a gain of the chromosome 3q region in three samples each. Array- based CGH performed using human BAC arrays (1400V11 Spectral Genomics Chip™) on the other hand, not only detected recurrent abnormalities of the chromosomes and chromosomal sites mentioned above, but also identified losses of additional chromosomal sites on chromosomes 6q and 13q. Array-based CGH further delineated the regions of loss or gain to specific chromosome bands or sub bands based on location of chromosomal site-specific BACs. The specific regions of losses are located at 1p36.2-36.3,6q12,9p13-ter,13q33.33-q34, and gain or amplification of chromosomal DNA at bands 3q26-27. It is interesting to note that some of the chromosomal sites of losses and gains also harbor gene(s) such as AFAR, RIZ1, p73(1p35-36), Akt-1(14q32), p14 and p16(9p21), NF2(22q12), ZASCI, p63 and PIK3CA oncogenes (3q26-27), all of which are known to play a major role in solid tumor pathogenesis. The role of these genes in GIST, however, remains to be seen. Thus, the results of our current study demonstrate that such a combined approach to detect global genomic alterations in GIST is significant in providing information related to chromosomal sites of potential tumor suppressor genes associated with multistep tumorigenesis; some of which also may be predictive of prognosis and clinical outcome following specific targeted therapy, which is the focus of future studies.

DTCs were immunostained with the pan-keratin antibody A45-B/B3.||||Fifteen of 76 patients (19.7%) harbored CTCs, whereas in 13 of 76 patients (17.1%), DTCs could be detected. In only 3 patients (3.9%), CTCs and DTCs were detected simultaneously, whereas concordant results (DTC/CTC negative and DTC/CTC positive) were found in 54 patients (71.1%). Surprisingly, only patients with CTCs showed significant shorter overall and relapse-free survival (P = 0.038 and P = 0.004, respectively). Multivariate analyses revealed that only the CTC status was an independent predictor of overall and relapse-free survival (P = 0.007 and P < 0.001, respectively).||||This is the first study analyzing CTC and DTC status in 1 cohort of nonmetastatic patients with EC.

Heat shock proteins in cancer stem cell maintenance: A potential therapeutic target?tCancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of tumor cells with unlimited self-renewal capability, multilineage differentiation potential and long-term tumor repopulation capacity. CSCs reside in anatomically distinct regions within the tumor microenvironment, called niches, and this favors the maintenance of CSC properties and preserves their phenotypic plasticity. Indeed, CSCs are characterized by a flexible state based on their capacity to interconvert between a differentiated and a stem-like phenotype, and this depends on the activation of adaptive mechanisms in response to different environmental conditions. Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) are molecular chaperones, upregulated upon cell exposure to several stress conditions and are responsible for normal maturation, localization and activity of intra and extracellular proteins. Noteworthy, HSPs play a central role in several cellular processes involved in tumor initiation and progression (i.e. cell viability, resistance to apoptosis, stress conditions and drug therapy, EMT, bioenergetics, invasiveness, metastasis formation) and, thus, are widely considered potential molecular targets. Furthermore, much evidence suggests a key regulatory function for HSPs in CSC maintenance and their upregulation has been proposed as a mechanism used by CSCs to adapt to unfavorable environmental conditions, such as nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, inflammation. This review discusses the relevance of HSPs in CSC biology, highlighting their role as novel potential molecular targets to develop anticancer strategies aimed at CSC targeting.

ATRX Mutations in Pineal Parenchymal Tumors of Intermediate Differentiation.tPineal parenchymal tumors are rare neoplasms, ranging from WHO Grade I to IV. There are few studies characterizing the molecular profiles of these tumors. ATRX alterations are strongly associated with the presence of the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) phenotype, and within the central nervous system they tend to occur in subsets of gliomas, including those with IDH, NF1, or histone (H3 K27M or G34) mutations. Here, we identified ATRX frameshift mutations by next generation sequencing associated with corresponding protein loss in 2 cases of pineal parenchymal tumors of intermediate differentiation (PPTID) developing in a 21-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man. In contrast, we identified partial ATRX loss in 1 pineoblastoma, among 14 pineal parenchymal tumors of various grades (6 pineoblastomas, 4 pineocytomas, and 4 PPTID) using tissue microarrays; ALT was absent in these cases. Evaluating the cBioPortal database, an ATRX mutation was identified in one (of 3 total) PPTIDs analyzed. Thus, ATRX mutations associated with protein loss and ALT develop in a small subset of pineal parenchymal tumors and may be limited to those with intermediate differentiation. The clinical significance of these alterations requires further study.

It mainly occurs in the long bones, more rarely in the jaws. Osteoblastoma of the jaws mainly involves the mandible while nasosinusal involvement is very rare. The diameter of the tumor can grow to 10 cm. On X-ray, the tumor may appear as a well or poorly defined clear lesion, usually scattered with mineral patches. Recurrence rate is very low after surgical resection as well as the risk of malignant transformation. We report the case of a 13-year old female patient presenting with nasal obstruction evolving over the last 3 months associated with episodes of epistaxis and left blurred vision. Clinical examination showed voluminous nasal concha with polyploid mucosa filling all the left nasal fossa with left axial exophthalmos. CT scan of the facial massif showed left frontoethmoidal expansive process measuring 50*47*36 mm, spontaneously hypodense, heterogeneous, non enhanced after injection of the Contrast materials, responsible for destruction of the ethmoidal labyrinth, swelling of the bony walls with mass effect on the ipsilateral orbit. The suspected diagnosis was frontoethmoidal mucocele. Hence, the decision to perform endonasal surgery. Whitish thick liquid was collected by the cranial portion of the middle nasal concha sugesting infected mucocele. Resection of the middle nasal concha was performed. The histological examination showed osteoblastoma of the middle nasal concha . Outcome was marked by regression of the exophthalmos with no recurrence during 1-year follow up period.

Given the potential for founder effects, and the highly genetic nature of dystonia, the Faroe Islands provide a particularly interesting setting to study the prevalence of dystonia.||||To estimate the prevalence of dystonia.||||We used a 2-phase, population-based design, screening 1,334 randomly selected Faroese individuals aged ≥40 years from which a subsample of 227 participated in an in-person clinical evaluation. Dystonia was assessed by 2 movement disorder neurologists using videotaped examinations.||||Two of 227 (0.88%, 95% CI -0.33 to 2.09%) were diagnosed with cervical or segmental dystonia. An unusual form of thumb flexion dystonia was noted in 75 more, yielding a combined prevalence of 33.92% (95% CI 27.73-40.11%).||||The prevalence of cervical or segmental dystonia was as high as in one prior population-based study using similar methods. Furthermore, an unusual form of thumb flexion dystonia was uncovered, which yielded an extraordinarily high prevalence of dystonia in this population. Although our methods likely contributed to more complete capture of subtle dystonia, founder effects are highly likely to have been an additional major contributor to these findings.

While promising therapeutic options exist for other adult cancers, there are no new molecular-based treatments developed for GEPNETs. One of the main targets of cancer immunotherapy is the Programmed Cell Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1) pathway. Our purpose was to investigate the profile of PD-L1 expression in different organs of GEPNETs and compare the conventional immunohistochemistry (IHC) with the RNA expression analysis via real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in order to determine which patients might be appropriate for immune check point-targeted therapy.||||A total of 59 surgically or endoscopically resected GEPNET tissues were retrospectively collected. The expression of PD-L1 and mRNA was evaluated with IHC.||||The expression of PD-L1 was significantly associated with the high-grade classification (p=0.012). PD-L1 mRNA expression in tumor samples appeared to be higher compared to the corresponding normal tissues. In appendix, stomach and small intestine, the expression of PD-L1 mRNA was higher in the tumor tissues compared to the respective controls. In pancreas and colon, control tissues tend to have a higher PD-L1 mRNA expression compared to tumor tissues. PD-L1 mRNA expression was higher in GEP carcinomas (p=0.0031).||||RT-PCR was found to be more sensitive in detecting PD-L1 expression than conventional IHC. This study may provide an important starting point and useful background information for future research about immunotherapy for appendix, stomach and small intestine neuroendocrine carcinomas.

Risk of Zika microcephaly correlates with features of maternal antibodies.tZika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy causes congenital abnormalities, including microcephaly. However, rates vary widely, and the contributing risk factors remain unclear. We examined the serum antibody response to ZIKV and other flaviviruses in Brazilian women giving birth during the 2015-2016 outbreak. Infected pregnancies with intermediate or higher ZIKV antibody enhancement titers were at increased risk to give birth to microcephalic infants compared with those with lower titers (P < 0.0001). Similarly, analysis of ZIKV-infected pregnant macaques revealed that fetal brain damage was more frequent in mothers with higher enhancement titers. Thus, features of the maternal antibodies are associated with and may contribute to the genesis of ZIKV-associated microcephaly.

Differential Expression and Diagnostic Significance of Pre-Albumin, Fibrinogen Combined with D-Dimer in AFP-Negative Hepatocellular Carcinoma.tHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most malignant cancers with high morbidity and mortality. Nowadays, AFP-negative hepatocellular carcinoma (AFP-NHCC) has been found in many HCC patients and AFP analysis can't be used to screen HCC in these cases. In this study, we have examined the expression patterns of pre-albumin (PA), fibrinogen, D-Dimer and their clinical significance in AFP-NHCC. We recruited 214 AFP-NHCC patients and 210 controls in the study. PA, fibrinogen and D-Dimer levels were detected by turbidimetry, clauss and immunoturbidimetry methods, respectively. Serum PA levels were significantly lower in AFP-NHCC (84.5 ± 24.7 mg/L) than that in the controls (240.6 ± 59.4 mg/L, P < 0.05). For plasma fibrinogen levels, there was no difference between the controls (2.9 ± 0.7 g/L) and AFP-NHCC (2.5 ± 0.7 g/L). Compared with AFP-NHCC (0.8 ± 0.2 mg/L), plasma D-Dimer levels were significantly lower in controls (0.1 ± 0.0 mg/L, P < 0.05). The levels of PA, fibrinogen and D-Dimer were significantly correlated with differentiation (P < 0.01), and the PA and D-Dimer values were correlated with TNM stage (P < 0.05). Moreover, PA levels were correlated with tumor size (P = 0.034). Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses elaborated that combination of PA, fibrinogen and D-Dimer possessed a higher sensitivity (93.4%) for differentiating AFP-NHCC from the controls, but the diagnostic specificity was reduced due to the combination of fibrinogen. After adjusting for all significant outcome predictors of the univariate logistic regression analysis, low levels of PA and high levels of D-Dimer were remained independent unfavorable outcome predictors (P < 0.05). Our data suggested that the expression levels of PA, fibrinogen and D-Dimer played critical roles in AFP-NHCC tumorigenesis. Moreover, PA and D-Dimer might be considered as potential diagnostic indicators in AFP-NHCC.

MD2 blockade prevents oxLDL-induced renal epithelial cell injury and protects against high-fat-diet-induced kidney dysfunction.tThere is a strong epidemiological link between obesity, a growing worldwide concern, and kidney disease. Emerging evidence indicates that the pathogenic basis of obesity-related kidney disease may be attributed to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) of the innate immune system. We hypothesized that renal epithelial cell injury in response to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) requires myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD2), a co-receptor of TLR4. Moreover, we also hypothesized that renal dysfunction is MD2-dependent in the high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model. Results indicated that the MD2 selective inhibitor (L6H21) abrogated the oxLDL-induced formation of MD2-TLR4 dimerization in the renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line NRK-52E. Further, MD2 blockade in NRK-52E cells using siRNA target sequences or L6H21 prevented oxLDL-induced cell injury as indicated by expression of profibrotic molecules, autophagic activity and apoptosis. Similarly, TLR4 knockdown in NRK-52E cells using siRNA target sequences prevented oxLDL-induced cell injury. In the HFD mouse model, MD2 knockout protected against development of kidney dysfunction and renal tissue injury, corroborating the observations observed in NRK-52E cells. Thus, the oxLDL-induced renal tubular epithelial cell profibrotic responses, autophagy and apoptosis were dependent on MD2, as were the renal dysfunction and tissue impairment in HFD mice. These are new findings indicating that the MD2-TLR4 immune signaling complex is a critical pathogenic factor in the development of kidney disease related to obesity or metabolic syndrome.

Human cytomegalovirus ie2 affects the migration of glioblastoma by mediating the different splicing patterns of RON through hnRNP A2B1.tGlioblastoma is the most aggressive intracranial tumor and diffuse migration is the leading cause of death. Recent evidence has indicated that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (hnRNP A2B1) is overexpressed in human glioblastoma tissue and enhances glioblastoma invasion in vitro. We found by mass spectrometry that hnRNP A2B1 interacts with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) immediate early 86 protein (IE86, ie2 gene-encoded) in malignant glioma cells (U87MG) infected with HCMV. However, the role of hnRNP A2 B1 in glioblastoma development remains poorly understood. Here, we report that hnRNP A2B1 is highly expressed in the HCMV·ie2 transgenic mice model. This phenomenon was confirmed in U87MG cell lines transfected with pEGFP-N3-ie2 plasmid. In addition, hnRNP A2B1 knockdown in U87MG cells inhibited tumor migration, and this effect might be mediated by hnRNP A2B1 through effects on splicing patterns of RON. Our data suggested that HCMV· ie2 promotes glioblastoma migration by regulating hnRNP A2B1 expression.

Crosstalk between colon cells and macrophages increases ST6GALNAC1 and MUC1-sTn expression in ulcerative colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer.tPatients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have an increased risk of developing colitis-associated colon cancer (CACC). Changes in glycosylation of the oncoprotein MUC1 commonly occur in chronic inflammation, including UC, and this abnormally glycosylated MUC1 promotes cancer development and progression. It is not known what causes changes in glycosylation of MUC1. Gene expression profiling of myeloid cells in inflamed and malignant colon tissues showed increased expression levels of inflammatory macrophage-associated cytokines compared to normal tissues. We analyzed the involvement of macrophage-associated cytokines in the induction of aberrant MUC1 glycoforms. A co-culture system was used to examine the effects of M1 and M2 macrophages on glycosylation-related enzymes in colon cancer cells. M2-like macrophages induced the expression of the glycosyltransferase ST6GALNAC1, an enzyme that adds sialic acid to O-linked GalNAc residues, promoting the formation of tumor-associated sialyl-Tn (sTn) O-glycans. Immunostaining of UC and CACC tissue samples confirmed the elevated number of M2-like macrophages as well as high expression of ST6GALNAC1 and the altered MUC1-sTn glycoform on colon cells. Cytokine arrays and blocking antibody experiments indicated that the macrophage-dependent ST6GALNAC1 activation was mediated by IL-13 and CCL17. We demonstrated that IL-13 promoted phosphorylation of STAT6 to activate transcription of ST6GALNAC1. A computational model of signaling pathways was assembled and used to test IL-13 inhibition as a possible therapy. Our findings revealed a novel cellular cross-talk between colon cells and macrophages within the inflamed and malignant colon that contributes to the pathogenesis of UC and CACC.

Prognosis and risk stratification in cardiac sarcoidosis patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.tAlthough recent reports showed that left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a prognostic factor in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis (CS), advances in diagnostic imaging have enabled us to detect CS patients with preserved LVEF in the early stage of the disorder. In the present study, we examined the prognosis and risk stratification in CS patients with preserved LVEF.||||We retrospectively examined 91 consecutive CS patients at our hospital from October 1998 to December 2015 (age, 57±11 years; male/female, 25/66) for the relationship between LVEF and major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation (VT/VF), heart failure (HF) admission, complete atrioventricular block, and all-cause death. CS patients with preserved LVEF (≥50%), as compared with those with reduced LVEF (<50%), showed significantly higher survival free from total MACE or VT/VF (log-rank p<0.001) and significantly smaller LV myocardial damaged area as evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (p<0.001). Although CS patients with preserved LVEF had a good prognosis in general, persistent right ventricular (RV) pacing and reduced EF were significant predictors for MACE after 1 year from introduction of steroid therapy (hazard ratio, 5.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-22.50, p=0.020, hazard ratio, 9.01; 95% confidence interval, 2.45-72.09; p=0.001). Patients with the 2 factors (LVEF reduction rate >13.9% per year and persistent RV pacing) had significantly higher risk for MACE, compared with those without them (log-rank p<0.001).||||The present study demonstrates that CS patients with preserved LVEF have better long-term prognosis than those with reduced LVEF in general. However, we should carefully follow them up, since chronological reduction in LVEF and persistent RV pacing could predict worse prognosis in those patients.

Characteristics and Clinical Outcomes of Patients With Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection.tBackground The goal of this study is to report the characteristics and long-term clinical outcomes of patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) and to identify factors associated with recurrent SCAD . Methods and Results This is a retrospective cohort study that included patients who underwent coronary angiography for evaluation of acute myocardial infarction between 2006 and 2016. Among 26 598 patients hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, 208 (0.78%) were diagnosed with SCAD . Patients with SCAD were younger (49.0±11.6 versus 65.6±12.2 years) and more likely to be women (88.9% versus 31.6%). Atherosclerotic risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and diabetes mellitus, were less prevalent. Median follow-up was 4.7 years. Mortality was lower in patients with SCAD (1-year mortality: 2.4% versus 8.8%; P<0.001). After using propensity score matching to control for differences in age, sex, and comorbidities, the difference in mortality was no longer present, suggesting that lower mortality in patients with SCAD is attributed primarily to their baseline characteristics. Recurrent SCAD occurred in 22 patients (10.6%). Multivariate Cox regression modeling showed concomitant fibromuscular dysplasia (hazard ratio, 5.1; 95% CI , 1.6-15.8; P=0.005) and migraine headaches (hazard ratio, 3.4; 95% CI , 1.4-8.4; P=0.008) to be associated with increased risk of recurrent SCAD . Conclusions Among patients with acute myocardial infarction, patients with SCAD have a lower risk of mortality, which is attributed primarily to their younger age, female sex, and low prevalence of atherosclerotic risk factors. Risk of recurrent SCAD persists years after the initial presentation. Patients with fibromuscular dysplasia and migraine are at higher risk for recurrent SCAD .

Facial Paralysis as Initial Manifestation of Light-chain Amyloidosis.tLight-chain (AL) amyloidosis is a systemic disease capable of damaging virtually all body tissues. Neurologic involvement is commonly manifested by dysautonomia and peripheral nervous system affection. However, from 1970 to 2018, only 12 cases of cranial nerve injury associated with AL amyloidosis were identified. Eight months before hospital admission, a previously healthy 61-year-old man complained to his general practitioner of episodes of lipotimia while walking and, three months later, he developed a left facial nerve paralysis assumed, at that time, to be idiopathic. After two months, he started complaining of dyspnea and lower limb edema. Physical examination at admission revealed hypotension, exuberant peripheral edema, jugular venous distention, periorbital purpura and left peripheral facial paralysis. He had elevated troponin and brain natriuretic peptide, mild proteinuria and a monoclonal gammopathy IgG/lambda. Bone marrow biopsy revealed 20% plasmocytes and cardiac ultrasound showed diffuse hypokinesia and restrictive filling pattern. AL amyloidosis with major cardiac involvement was considered and a rectal biopsy revealed amyloid protein. Chemotherapy protocol to AL amyloidosis was initiated but cardiac disease progressed leading to death. Persistent facial nerve paralysis should be considered as a rare initial manifestation of AL amyloidosis allowing an earlier diagnosis.

An immunohistochemical evaluation of podoplanin expression in oral leukoplakia and oral squamous cell carcinoma to explore its potential to be used as a predictor for malignant transformation.tOral leukoplakia (OL) is a potentially malignant disorder with increased risk for the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Many cases of OSCC arise from the malignant transformation of preexisting OL. However, the risk of progression into OSCC and the possible prediction of malignant potential of OL remain inconclusive. Recent studies have shown that podoplanin, a mucin-like transmembrane glycoprotein specifically expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells, is expressed in various neoplasms including OSCC, indicating its possible biologic role in tumor cells. In this study, an evaluation of podoplanin expression in OL and OSCC has been carried out to assess its potential role as a biomarker to predict the possibility of malignant transformation in OL cases.||||To assess the usefulness of podoplanin as a potential biomarker for predicting the risk of malignant transformation in OL, by comparing its immunohistochemical expression in OL and OSCC.||||Archival paraffin-embedded blocks of 25 OL cases with varying grades of dysplasia and 30 OSCC cases showing its varying grades were selected. Sections were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for podoplanin and compared with the control group for evaluation of results in the three groups.||||, whereas in OSCC, well-differentiated group showed the maximum expression of podoplanin.||||The progressive increase in podoplanin expression through the increasing grades of dysplasia in OL is suggestive of an increased risk for malignant transformation with increased expression of podoplanin in OL cases. A high podoplanin expression in the well-differentiated OSCC may indicate a vital role for podoplanin in the early stages of tumorigenesis.

A rare cause of familial exogenous Cushing syndrome.tExogenous steroid use is the most common cause of Cushing syndrome. With the use of glucocorticoids(GC) for a variety of diseases, the indiscriminate use of this group of drugs has increased. We present a family from which both children were brought with features suggestive of Cushing syndrome. On evaluation, they were found to have suppressed hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, signifying steroid use from exogenous sources. On further evaluation by a psychiatrist, the mother who was on treatment for chronic depression confessed that she had bought dexamethasone tablets over the counter, and administered the same, mixed with fruit juices to her sons. The family was counselled regarding the consequences of chronic steroid abuse and the children were started on replacement doses of prednisolone. Certain features like posterior subcapsular cataract, glaucoma, avascular necrosis of femur and psychosis are specific to exogenous Cushing syndrome. Despite efforts to understand the effects of long-term steroid treatment on the HPA axis, it is not yet clear as to which patients will have prolonged HPA axis suppression. The time taken for the recovery of HPA axis remains variable. Also, HPA axis suppression due to exogenous steroids may present as acute adrenal crisis. Hence, it is important to start these patients on replacement dose of steroids and also educate them regarding the increased requirement of steroids during stress.

Increased epoch-to-epoch parasympathetic cardiac regulation in participants with posttraumatic stress disorder compared to those with panic disorder and control participants.tResearch on the link between respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has largely focused on average levels of RSA. However, given that rapid shifts in parasympathetic tone are necessary to maintain adaptive cardiac variability, the exclusive focus on these tonic estimates provides an incomplete quantification of parasympathetic cardiac regulation.||||The present study is a secondary analysis of previously published data. This analysis aimed to address this limitation by examining the dynamic regulatory effect of the parasympathetic nervous system on heart rate. As such, we examined epoch-to-epoch parasympathetic cardiac regulation - operationalized as the lagged relationship between RSA and heart rate (HR) across consecutive 30-s epochs - across a single night in participants with PTSD, panic disorder (PD), comorbid PTSD and PD (PTSD + PD), and healthy controls. Electrocardiogram and respiratory signals were continuously recorded from 23 participants with PTSD, 14 with PD, 16 with PTSD + PD, and 16 control participants over a single night of sleep in a laboratory setting.||||No group differences in tonic RSA were observed; however, participants with PTSD only and PTSD + PD exhibited significantly greater epoch-to-epoch parasympathetic cardiac regulation over the night than those with PD only and control participants. Moreover, greater severity of hyperarousal symptoms was significantly associated with increased epoch-to-epoch parasympathetic cardiac regulation among participants with PTSD only and PTSD + PD.||||These data provide preliminary evidence for an upregulatory parasympathetic response to self-reported hyperarousal in participants with PTSD only and PTSD + PD reflected by increased epoch-to-epoch parasympathetic cardiac regulation.

Epidemiology of Cardiac Amyloidosis-Associated Heart Failure Hospitalizations Among Fee-for-Service Medicare Beneficiaries in the United States.tBackground Cardiac amyloidosis is a substantially underdiagnosed disease, and contemporary estimates of the epidemiology of amyloidosis are lacking. This study aims to determine the incidence and prevalence of cardiac amyloidosis among Medicare beneficiaries from 2000 to 2012. Methods and Results Medicare beneficiaries were counted in the prevalence cohort in each year they had (1) ≥1 principal or secondary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code for amyloidosis and (2) ≥1 principal or secondary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code for heart failure or cardiomyopathy within 2 years after the systemic amyloidosis code. A beneficiary was counted in the incidence cohort only during the first year in which they met criteria. Primary outcomes included the prevalence and incidence of hospitalizations for cardiac amyloidosis. There were 4746 incident cases of cardiac amyloidosis in 2012 and 15 737 prevalent cases in 2012. There was also a significant increase in the prevalence rate (8 to 17 per 100 000 person-years) and incidence rate (18 to 55 per 100 000 person-years) from 2000 to 2012, most notable after 2006. Incidence and prevalence increased substantially more among men, the elderly, and in blacks. Conclusions The incidence and prevalence rates of cardiac amyloidosis are higher than previously thought. The incidence and prevalence rates of cardiac amyloidosis among hospitalized patients have increased since 2000, particularly among specific patient subgroups and after 2006, suggesting improved amyloidosis awareness and higher diagnostic rates with noninvasive imaging. In light of these trends, cardiac amyloidosis should be considered during the initial work up of patients ≥65 years old hospitalized with heart failure.

Occurrence of severe hypoglycaemic events among US youth and young adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.tAlthough severe hypoglycaemia (SH) can lead to adverse health outcomes, little is known about its occurrence and re-occurrence among youth with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.||||This study included 2740 participants aged <20 years at diabetes diagnosis and 5-14 years diabetes duration from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Cohort Study. Participants reported SH events in the past 6 months. Differences in SH events by demographic and clinical factors were tested using logistic regression models.|||| < 0.002). The median number of SH events per youth who had at least one SH event in the past 6 months was 1 for both type 1 type 2 diabetes. For youth with type 1 diabetes, those who reported SH events were older, were more likely to have obesity or to be physically active, and had lower HbA1c. After adjustments, one unit increase in HbA1c was associated with 16% lower likelihood (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.94) and being physically active was associated with an 87% higher likelihood (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.23, 2.86) of reporting a SH event. There were too few SH events among youth with type 2 diabetes to analyse further.||||In youth with diabetes, SH was common even within a short 6-month window. Better understanding the causes of SH may help prevent them from occurring.

Differential Expression and Diagnostic Significance of Pre-Albumin, Fibrinogen Combined with D-Dimer in AFP-Negative Hepatocellular Carcinoma.tHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most malignant cancers with high morbidity and mortality. Nowadays, AFP-negative hepatocellular carcinoma (AFP-NHCC) has been found in many HCC patients and AFP analysis can't be used to screen HCC in these cases. In this study, we have examined the expression patterns of pre-albumin (PA), fibrinogen, D-Dimer and their clinical significance in AFP-NHCC. We recruited 214 AFP-NHCC patients and 210 controls in the study. PA, fibrinogen and D-Dimer levels were detected by turbidimetry, clauss and immunoturbidimetry methods, respectively. Serum PA levels were significantly lower in AFP-NHCC (84.5 ± 24.7 mg/L) than that in the controls (240.6 ± 59.4 mg/L, P < 0.05). For plasma fibrinogen levels, there was no difference between the controls (2.9 ± 0.7 g/L) and AFP-NHCC (2.5 ± 0.7 g/L). Compared with AFP-NHCC (0.8 ± 0.2 mg/L), plasma D-Dimer levels were significantly lower in controls (0.1 ± 0.0 mg/L, P < 0.05). The levels of PA, fibrinogen and D-Dimer were significantly correlated with differentiation (P < 0.01), and the PA and D-Dimer values were correlated with TNM stage (P < 0.05). Moreover, PA levels were correlated with tumor size (P = 0.034). Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses elaborated that combination of PA, fibrinogen and D-Dimer possessed a higher sensitivity (93.4%) for differentiating AFP-NHCC from the controls, but the diagnostic specificity was reduced due to the combination of fibrinogen. After adjusting for all significant outcome predictors of the univariate logistic regression analysis, low levels of PA and high levels of D-Dimer were remained independent unfavorable outcome predictors (P < 0.05). Our data suggested that the expression levels of PA, fibrinogen and D-Dimer played critical roles in AFP-NHCC tumorigenesis. Moreover, PA and D-Dimer might be considered as potential diagnostic indicators in AFP-NHCC.

Collagenase Nanoparticles Enhance the Penetration of Drugs into Pancreatic Tumors.tOverexpressed extracellular matrix (ECM) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) limits drug penetration into the tumor and is associated with poor prognosis. Here, we demonstrate that a pretreatment based on a proteolytic-enzyme nanoparticle system disassembles the dense PDAC collagen stroma and increases drug penetration into the pancreatic tumor. More specifically, the collagozome, a 100 nm liposome encapsulating collagenase, was rationally designed to protect the collagenase from premature deactivation and prolonged its release rate at the target site. Collagen is the main component of the PDAC stroma, reaching 12.8 ± 2.3% vol in diseased mice pancreases, compared to 1.4 ± 0.4% in healthy mice. Upon intravenous injection of the collagozome, ∼1% of the injected dose reached the pancreas over 8 h, reducing the level of fibrotic tissue to 5.6 ± 0.8%. The collagozome pretreatment allowed increased drug penetration into the pancreas and improved PDAC treatment. PDAC tumors, pretreated with the collagozome followed by paclitaxel micelles, were 87% smaller than tumors pretreated with empty liposomes followed by paclitaxel micelles. Interestingly, degrading the ECM did not increase the number of circulating tumor cells or metastasis. This strategy holds promise for degrading the extracellular stroma in other diseases as well, such as liver fibrosis, enhancing tissue permeability before drug administration.

Vascular Inflammation and Oxidative Stress: Major Triggers for Cardiovascular Disease.tCardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death and reduced quality of life, proven by the latest data of the Global Burden of Disease Study, and is only gaining in prevalence worldwide. Clinical trials have identified chronic inflammatory disorders as cardiovascular risks, and recent research has revealed a contribution by various inflammatory cells to vascular oxidative stress. Atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease are closely associated with inflammation, probably due to the close interaction of inflammation with oxidative stress. Classical therapies for inflammatory disorders have demonstrated protective effects in various models of cardiovascular disease; especially established drugs with pleiotropic immunomodulatory properties have proven beneficial cardiovascular effects; normalization of oxidative stress seems to be a common feature of these therapies. The close link between inflammation and redox balance was also supported by reports on aggravated inflammatory phenotype in the absence of antioxidant defense proteins (e.g., superoxide dismutases, heme oxygenase-1, and glutathione peroxidases) or overexpression of reactive oxygen species producing enzymes (e.g., NADPH oxidases). The value of immunomodulation for the treatment of cardiovascular disease was recently supported by large-scale clinical trials demonstrating reduced cardiovascular mortality in patients with established atherosclerotic disease when treated by highly specific anti-inflammatory therapies (e.g., using monoclonal antibodies against cytokines). Modern antidiabetic cardiovascular drugs (e.g., SGLT2 inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, and GLP-1 analogs) seem to share these immunomodulatory properties and display potent antioxidant effects, all of which may explain their successful lowering of cardiovascular risk.

MD2 blockade prevents oxLDL-induced renal epithelial cell injury and protects against high-fat-diet-induced kidney dysfunction.tThere is a strong epidemiological link between obesity, a growing worldwide concern, and kidney disease. Emerging evidence indicates that the pathogenic basis of obesity-related kidney disease may be attributed to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) of the innate immune system. We hypothesized that renal epithelial cell injury in response to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) requires myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD2), a co-receptor of TLR4. Moreover, we also hypothesized that renal dysfunction is MD2-dependent in the high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model. Results indicated that the MD2 selective inhibitor (L6H21) abrogated the oxLDL-induced formation of MD2-TLR4 dimerization in the renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line NRK-52E. Further, MD2 blockade in NRK-52E cells using siRNA target sequences or L6H21 prevented oxLDL-induced cell injury as indicated by expression of profibrotic molecules, autophagic activity and apoptosis. Similarly, TLR4 knockdown in NRK-52E cells using siRNA target sequences prevented oxLDL-induced cell injury. In the HFD mouse model, MD2 knockout protected against development of kidney dysfunction and renal tissue injury, corroborating the observations observed in NRK-52E cells. Thus, the oxLDL-induced renal tubular epithelial cell profibrotic responses, autophagy and apoptosis were dependent on MD2, as were the renal dysfunction and tissue impairment in HFD mice. These are new findings indicating that the MD2-TLR4 immune signaling complex is a critical pathogenic factor in the development of kidney disease related to obesity or metabolic syndrome.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the endogenous cortisol response to corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and determine whether it is effective for elucidating the pathology and selecting treatment in LCC.||||This retrospective study examined infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Included were preterm (gestational age <34 weeks) infants who underwent CRH stimulation test and were treated for LCC with no obvious cause. Hydrocortisone (HC; 3.3-10 mg/kg) was given by bolus injection to the LCC infants. At 2 h after treatment, infants without a 20% rise in blood pressure (systolic or mean) from before treatment were defined as non-responsive to HC, and given catecholamine and/or vasopressin.||||Sixteen infants (median gestational age, 24 weeks 3 days; birthweight, 638 g) were eligible. Six of the infants had a good response to the CRH stimulation test. HC was effective in only three CRH good-response cases, and catecholamine and/or vasopressin was needed in the three other cases. HC was effective, however, for all CRH non-response cases.||||Although HC is the first-choice treatment for LCC, the CRH stimulation test facilitates prompt treatment of LCC, which may prevent PVL. The present findings help elucidate the pathology and aid in the selection of treatment for infants with LCC.

The ying and yang of idebenone: Not too little, not too much - cell death in NQO1 deficient cells and the mouse retina.tIdebenone has recently been investigated as a drug therapy for Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a rare genetic mitochondrial disease that causes rapid and progressive bilateral vision loss. Although several studies have shown that idebenone can promote vision recovery in patients with LHON, the evidence for the efficacy of idebenone is still limited. Idebenone failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in the primary end-points of the only published randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. There appears to be a patient-specific response to idebenone with high variability in therapeutic outcomes. A recent study suggested that the cytosolic enzyme NAD(P)H: quinone acceptor oxidoreductase (NQO1) is the major enzyme involved in the activation of idebenone, and the beneficial effects of idebenone are dependent on the expression of NQO1. Here, we confirm the NQO1-dependent activity of idebenone, but we also show, for the first time, that the cytotoxicity of idebenone is linked to cellular expression of NQO1. Upon idebenone administration, cells deficient in NQO1 show a marked decrease in viability in comparison to NQO1 expressing cells, with idebenone causing ROS production and deleterious effects on ATP levels and cell viability. In addition, our data highlights that only cells expressing NQO1 can significantly activate idebenone, indicating that other proposed metabolic activation pathways, such as complex II and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, do not play a significant role in idebenone activation. Furthermore, we provide evidence of idebenone-induced toxicity in the retina ex-vivo, which can be explained by the variation of NQO1 expression between different cell types in the mouse retina. Idebenone mediated cell rescue in the rotenone ex vivo model also indicated that this drug has a narrow therapeutic window. These findings will help to guide the development of future therapies and drug delivery strategies including intra-ocular administration. The specific dependence of idebenone activity on NQO1 may also explain the variation in patient outcomes in clinical trials.

Target-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Deprivation Puts Retinal Ganglion Cells on Death Row: Cold Hard Evidence and Caveats.tGlaucoma and other optic neuropathies are characterized by axonal transport deficits. Axonal cargo travels back and forth between the soma and the axon terminus, a mechanism ensuring homeostasis and the viability of a neuron. An example of vital molecules in the axonal cargo are neurotrophic factors (NTFs). Hindered retrograde transport can cause a scarcity of those factors in the retina, which in turn can tilt the fate of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) towards apoptosis. This postulation is one of the most widely recognized theories to explain RGC death in the disease progression of glaucoma and is known as the NTF deprivation theory. For several decades, research has been focused on the use of NTFs as a novel neuroprotective glaucoma treatment. Until now, results in animal models have been promising, but translation to the clinic has been highly disappointing. Are we lacking important knowledge to lever NTF therapies towards the therapeutic armamentarium? Or did we get the wrong end of the stick regarding the NTF deprivation theory? In this review, we will tackle the existing evidence and caveats advocating for and against the target-derived NTF deprivation theory in glaucoma, whilst digging into associated therapy efforts.

Herein, we describe the case of a 53-year-old man who presented with acute kidney injury (AKI) that occurred after carboplatin administration and was diagnosed with biopsy-proven acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). To our knowledge, this is the second case report of carboplatin-related AIN. The patient was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, and chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and irinotecan was initiated. However, 1 week later, he was admitted to our institution with fever, fatigue and an increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) level. The chemotherapy regimen was altered to carboplatin and etoposide, but high fever occurred on the first day, and CRP re-elevation and AKI became apparent 9 days later. Renal biopsy revealed prominent inflammatory cell infiltration into the interstitium, which lead to the pathological diagnosis of AIN. On immunostaining for surface markers, CD3- and CD68-positive cells were found to be predominant, and CD20-positive cells were relatively few. Although the serum creatinine level increased to 6.81 mg/dL, it decreased to 1.43 mg/dL 15 days after steroid therapy. This case demonstrated that carboplatin-related kidney injury includes not only ATN but also AIN. Appropriate pathological diagnosis including renal biopsy and indications for steroid treatment should be carefully considered.

Diagnostic Evaluation of Isotropic 3D MRCP Images in the Diagnosis of Cholangiocarcinoma.tThis is a cross sectional study to establish that Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) could be accepted as the most effective imaging modality for the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. Cholangiocarcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of the bile duct. It is much less common than hepatocellular carcinoma, accounting for 5-30% of all hepatic malignancies. Clinically suspected patients with obstructive jaundice due to cholangiocarcinoma were referred to the Department of Radiology and Imaging, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh. The study was carried out in 60 patients, of which 38(63%) were male and 22(37%) were female. Out of 60 cases 56 cases were truly diagnosed by MRCP, 4 were normal, among these 1 case was diagnosed as cholangiocarcinoma as compared with histopathology. Forty four (44) patients (73.2%) of the patients were in sixth decade of life. The overall sensitivity and specificity were found to be 98.2% and 75%. The diagnostic accuracy was 96.7% & positive predictive value was about 98%.

Systematic review and meta-analysis on the incidence and prevalence of autoimmune hepatitis in Asian, European, and American population.tReported incidence and prevalence rates of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) have been sparse and heterogeneous. The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the worldwide incidence and prevalence rates of AIH and reveal population difference.||||Published articles on the epidemiology of AIH in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched from inception to April 28, 2019. Two investigators independently reviewed these literatures and evaluated their quality. A random-effects model was used to pool the overall incidence and prevalence rates. The impact of population difference, gender, age, study period, study quality, diagnostic criteria, and study design was further analyzed with subgroup analysis and meta-regression.||||A total of 22 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled worldwide annual incidence and prevalence of AIH were 1.37 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95-1.80) and 17.44 (95% CI: 12.01-22.87) per 100 000 persons, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that the pooled annual incidence for Asian, European, and American population was 1.31 (95% CI: 0.42-2.20), 1.37 (95% CI: 1.10-1.64), and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.44-1.56) per 100 000 persons, respectively; the pooled prevalence for Asian, European, and American population was 12.99 (95% CI: 2.05-23.92), 19.44 (95% CI: 15.63-23.24), and 22.80 (95% CI: -13.48 to 59.07) per 100 000 persons, respectively. In addition, higher incidence and prevalence rates were observed in women than men, and a higher prevalence rate was observed in elderly than young people.||||Autoimmune hepatitis is a rare disease, with a similar incidence worldwide and a higher prevalence in European and American than in Asian population.

Health disparities among breast cancer patients with/without disabilities in Germany.tPrevalence and incidence of cancer are increasing in people with disability. Nevertheless, little is known about cancer care for people with disabilities.||||The goal of this study was to examine the quality of care of breast cancer patients with pre-existing disabilities regarding diagnosis and type of breast surgery in Germany.||||Within the framework of quality assurance of breast cancer centers, a patient survey was conducted by the University of Cologne. Survey data from 4626 newly-diagnosed breast cancer patients treated in 86 hospitals were analyzed using multilevel modeling. Data about socio-demographics, disability specific data as well as data about diagnosis and type of surgery were collected.||||About 13% (n = 568) of the patients indicated they had a pre-existing disability prior to their breast cancer. The majority of patients with disabilities have physical impairments (PI n = 385; 68.0%) or sensory impairments (SI n = 131; 23.1%). 16.7% of the patients indicated they have a mental illness (MI n = 95; 16.7%) and 8 patients indicated to have an intellectual disability (ID n = 8; 1.4%). Patients with PI and SI are less often diagnosed for cancer through a mammography screening (OR PI = 0.70; p < 0.05; OR SI = 0.58; p < 0.05). Patients with PI are less likely to receive breast conserving treatment (OR = 0.58; p < 0.00) and more likely to have a mastectomy without reconstruction (OR = 1.96; p < 0.00) compared to patients without disabilities.||||Our data show that there are differences in the frequency of cancer diagnosis through mammography screening and in surgery applied between breast cancer patients with and without disabilities.

IGF-1R pathway activation as putative biomarker for linsitinib therapy to revert tamoxifen resistance in ER-positive breast cancer.tPreclinical studies indicate that activated IGF-1R can drive endocrine resistance in ER-positive (ER+) breast cancer, but its clinical relevance is unknown. We studied the effect of IGF-1R signaling on tamoxifen benefit in patients and we searched for approaches to overcome IGF-1R-mediated tamoxifen failure in cell lines. Primary tumor blocks from postmenopausal ER+ breast cancer patients randomized between adjuvant tamoxifen versus nil were recollected. Immunohistochemistry for IGF-1R, p-IGF-1R/InsR, p-ERα(Ser118), p-ERα(Ser167) and PI3K/MAPK pathway proteins was performed. Multivariate Cox models were employed to assess tamoxifen efficacy. The association between p-IGF-1R/InsR and PI3K/MAPK pathway activation in MCF-7 and T47D cells was analyzed with Western blots. Cell proliferation experiments were performed under various growth-stimulating and -inhibiting conditions. Patients with ER+, IGF-1R-positive breast cancer without p-IGF-1R/InsR staining (n = 242) had tamoxifen benefit (HR 0.41, p = 0.0038), while the results for p-IGF-1R/InsR-positive patients (n = 125) were not significant (HR 0.95, p = 0.3). High p-ERα(Ser118) or p-ERα(Ser167) expression was associated with less tamoxifen benefit. In MCF-7 cells, IGF-1R stimulation increased phosphorylation of PI3K/MAPK proteins and ERα(Ser167) regardless of IGF-1R overexpression. This could be abrogated by the dual IGF-1R/InsR inhibitor linsitinib, but not by the IGF-IR-selective antibody 1H7. In MCF-7 and T47D cells, stimulation of the IGF-1R/InsR pathway resulted in cell proliferation regardless of tamoxifen. Abrogation of cell growth was regained by addition of linsitinib. In conclusion, p-IGF-1R/InsR positivity in ER+ breast cancer is associated with reduced benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen in postmenopausal patients. In cell lines, stimulation rather than overexpression of IGF-1R is driving tamoxifen resistance to be abrogated by linsitinib.

A twelve-year study of the prevalence, risk factors and characteristics of interval colorectal cancers after negative colonoscopy.tThe objective of our study was to describe and analyse the Post-Colonoscopy Colorectal Cancers (PCCRCs) and endoscopist performance-related risk factors in the Isère regional screening programme.||||This was a population-based retrospective cohort study between 2002-2013, where Post-Colonoscopy Colorectal Cancers (PCCRCs) were defined as colorectal adenocarcinoma diagnosed between six and sixty months post-colonoscopy following a positive gFOBT. We analysed the endoscopist performance-related risk factors of the 62 gastroenterologists who had carried out at least 30 colonoscopies during this period.||||During the period reviewed, there were 10,557 negative colonoscopies performed. Fifteen post-colonoscopy colorectal cancers were diagnosed from 2002-2013 with an average patient age of 67.1 years. Men comprised 73% of the cases and 53% of all the cases were found in the distal colon. These 15 cases comprised 1.1% of all Colorectal Cancers (CRCs) diagnosed in the screening programme, with an incidence rate of 0.42 (0.21-0.77) per 1,000 person-years. The aetiological breakdown was as follows: 47% related to missed cancers, 27% were new cancers, 20% were failed biopsy detection, and 6% related to incomplete removal. The Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR) among gastroenterologists was an average of 30%, but large heterogeneity was present within this number, ranging from 11% to 49%.||||The post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer prevalence and incident rate were low relative to the literature. However, significant heterogeneity was present in the adenoma detection rate. Decreasing this heterogeneity by establishing a national benchmark, regular performance feedback and training modules should homogenise adenoma detection rates and decrease the number of interval cancers in the region.

Our objective was to compare the yield of exome sequencing (ES) with that of chromosomal microarray (CMA), the current first-tier test for NDDs.||||We performed a PubMed scoping review and meta-analysis investigating the diagnostic yield of ES for NDDs as the basis of a consensus development conference. We defined NDD as global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and/or autism spectrum disorder. The consensus development conference included input from genetics professionals, pediatric neurologists, and developmental behavioral pediatricians.||||After applying strict inclusion/exclusion criteria, we identified 30 articles with data on molecular diagnostic yield in individuals with isolated NDD, or NDD plus associated conditions (such as Rett-like features). Yield of ES was 36% overall, 31% for isolated NDD, and 53% for the NDD plus associated conditions. ES yield for NDDs is markedly greater than previous studies of CMA (15-20%).||||Our review demonstrates that ES consistently outperforms CMA for evaluation of unexplained NDDs. We propose a diagnostic algorithm placing ES at the beginning of the evaluation of unexplained NDDs.

However, there is no nationwide epidemiological data on HF in China after 2000. The aims of this study are (i) to determine the prevalence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and HF (with reduced, mid-range, and preserved ejection fraction) in a nationally representative Chinese population, and (ii) to investigate the treatment and control of hypertension in HF patients.||||Data from the China Hypertension Survey (CHS) and 22 158 participants were eligible for analysis in this study. For each participant, a self-reported history of HF and any other cardiovascular diseases was acquired. Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography was used to assess LV dysfunction. Overall, 1.3% (estimated 13.7 million) of the Chinese adult population aged ≥35 years had HF, 1.4% of participants had LV systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction <50%), and 2.7% were graded as having 'moderate' or 'severe' LV diastolic dysfunction. The weighted prevalence of HF was similar between urban and rural residents (1.6% vs. 1.1%, P = 0.266), and between men and women (1.4% vs. 1.2%, P = 0.632). In addition, among HF patients with hypertension, 57.7% received antihypertensive medication, and 14.5% had their blood pressure controlled <140/90 mmHg.||||In summary, there was an increase in the prevalence of HF, and LV dysfunction was very common in China.

A total of 78 patients with gastric cancer admitted to Dongying People's Hospital from July 2015 to June 2017 were enrolled, and 80 healthy patients were selected as the control group during the same period. The expression levels of miR-23a and miR-135 in the serum of the two groups were detected by RT-qPCR, and the expression levels of tumor markers CEA and carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA199) were detected by ELISA. The receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of miR-23a and miR-135 as diagnostic indicators. There was no significant difference between the observation and the control group (P>0.05). The expression levels of miR-23a and miR-135 in the observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). The expression levels of CEA and CA199 in serum of patients in the observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). Pearson's correlation test showed that the expression levels of miR-23a and miR-135 were positively correlated with CEA and CA199 (P<0.05). The specificity, sensitivity and AUC of miR-23a in the diagnosis of gastric cancer were 67.95, 87.50 and 0.805%, respectively. The specificity, sensitivity and AUC of miR-135 in the diagnosis of gastric cancer were 73.08, 82.50 and 0.824%, respectively. Both could be used in the diagnosis of gastric cancer. In conclusion, miR-23a and miR-135 are highly expressed in gastric cancer patients and positively correlated with tumor markers, which can be used in diagnosis for gastric cancer.

Increased Intra-Subject Variability of Reaction Times and Single-Trial Event-Related Potential Components in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder.tAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an increasingly common neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 1 in 59 children. The cognitive profiles of individuals with ASD are varied, and the neurophysiological underpinnings of these developmental difficulties are unclear. While many studies have focused on overall group differences in the amplitude or latency of event related potential (ERP) responses, recent research suggests that increased intra-subject neural variability may also be a reliable indicator of atypical brain function in ASD. This study aimed to identify behavioral and neural variability responses during an emotional inhibitory control task in children with ASD compared to typically developing (TD) children. Children with ASD showed increased variability in response to both inhibitory and emotional stimuli, evidenced by greater reaction time variability and single-trial ERP variability of N200 and N170 amplitudes and/or latencies compared to TD children. These results suggest that the physiological basis of ASD may be more accurately explained by increased intra-subject variability, in addition to characteristic increases or decreases in the amplitude or latency of neural responses. Autism Res 2019. © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: The cognitive functions including memory, attention, executive functions, and perception, of individuals with ASD are varied, and the physiological underpinnings of these profiles are unclear. In this study, children with ASD showed increased intra-subject neural and behavioral variability in response to an emotional inhibitory control task compared to typically developing children. These results suggest that the physiological basis of ASD may also be explained by increased behavioral and neural variability in people with ASD, rather than simply characteristic increases or decreases in averaged brain responses.

Is optical coherence tomography angiography helpful in the differential diagnosis of choroidal nevus versus melanoma?tTo describe the imaging features of choroidal nevus and melanoma using optical coherence tomography angiography, and evaluate the ability of this technique to establish the differential diagnosis based on the display of the tumor's intrinsic vasculature.||||Comparative analysis of optical coherence tomography angiography findings in consecutive patients diagnosed with choroidal nevus or choroidal melanoma following a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including best-corrected visual acuity and several imaging studies: color fundus photography, B-scan ultrasound, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, and optical coherence tomography angiography. Optical coherence tomography angiography was used to investigate qualitative differences in the tumor vasculature.||||Thirty-six eyes (18 cases of choroidal nevus and 18 cases of choroidal melanoma) from 36 consecutive patients were included in the study. Only cases located posterior to equator were included to enable performance of all tests. On optical coherence tomography angiography, choroidal nevus showed well-delimited margins (78%), hyperreflective choroid capillary vasculature (83%), fewer avascular areas (17%), and neovascular membrane in one case (6%). Choroidal melanoma showed imprecise margins (72%), hyporeflective choroidal capillary vasculature (72%), multiple avascular areas (78%), and choroidal vascular changes (e.g. thick vascular networks or vascular loops; 45%).||||Optical coherence tomography angiography can provide useful information for assessing and differentiating between choroidal nevi and small melanomas. Significant differences between these conditions were found for the pattern of reflectivity, and presence/absence of avascular zones and vascular anomalies, which could be helpful for supporting the diagnosis.

Beta-thalassemia major complicated by intracranial hemorrhage and critical illness polyneuropathy.tIntracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is rarely seen in patients with thalassemia. A seven-year-old male, known case of beta-thalassemia major, on irregular packed cell transfusions (elsewhere) and non-compliant with chelation therapy, presented with congestive cardiac failure (Hb-3 gm/dl). He received three packed red cell transfusions over 7 days (cumulative volume 40 cc/kg). On the 9th day, he developed projectile vomiting and two episodes of generalized tonic-clonic convulsions with altered sensorium. He had exaggerated deep tendon reflexes and extensor plantars. CT-scan of brain revealed bilateral acute frontal hematoma with diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (frontal and parietal). Coagulation profile was normal. CT-angiography of brain showed diffuse focal areas of reduced caliber of anterior cerebral, middle cerebral, and basilar and internal carotid arteries (likely to be a spasmodic reaction to subarachnoid hemorrhage). He required mechanical ventilation for 4 days and conservative management for the hemorrhage. However, on the 18th day, he developed one episode of generalized tonic-clonic convulsion and his sensorium deteriorated further (without any new ICH) and required repeat mechanical ventilation for 12 days.

Safety, clinical activity and biomarker assessments of atezolizumab from a Phase I study in advanced/recurrent ovarian and uterine cancers.tPatients with advanced/recurrent epithelial ovarian and uterine cancers have limited treatment options beyond platinum chemotherapy. Both tumor types can express programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), providing a potential therapeutic target for these patients. Here we present data from the ovarian and uterine cancer cohorts of the Phase I atezolizumab monotherapy study (PCD4989g).||||This Phase I, multi-center, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation/expansion clinical trial investigated single-agent atezolizumab in cohorts of patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian or uterine cancer. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single-agent atezolizumab. Anti-tumor activity and preliminary assessment of potential biomarkers were evaluated as secondary and exploratory objectives, respectively.||||The ovarian and uterine cancer cohorts enrolled 12 and 15 patients, respectively (10 [83%] and 5 [33%], respectively, had PD-L1 ≥ 5% on tumor-infiltrating immune cells). Atezolizumab was generally well tolerated with no new safety signals identified. The safety profiles in both cohorts were consistent with the known profile of atezolizumab monotherapy. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were mostly Grade ≤ 2, with no treatment-related Grade ≥ 4 AEs reported. Preliminary anti-tumor activity, with long durations of response, was observed in 2 patients from each cohort (ovarian cancer, 8.1 and 30.6+ months; uterine cancer, 7.3 and 16.6+ months). High microsatellite instability and tumor mutational burden were noted in the responders from the uterine cancer cohort.||||Atezolizumab monotherapy was well tolerated in patients with epithelial ovarian or uterine cancer and may have clinical activity warranting further investigation.||||ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01375842.

Immunotherapy: breaching the barriers for cancer treatment.tThe great ambition to treat cancer through harnessing a patient's own immune responses has started to become reality. Clinical trials have shown impressive results and some patients reaching the end of existing treatment options have achieved full remission. Yet the response rate even within the most promising trials remain at just 30-40% of patients. To date, the focus of immunotherapy research has been to identify tumour antigens, and to enhance activation of effector lymphocytes. Yet this is only the first step to effective immunotherapy for a broader range of patients. Activated cytotoxic T cells can only act on their tumour cell targets if they have free and easy access to all tumour regions. Solid tumours are complex, heterogeneous environments which vary greatly in their physical properties. We must now focus our efforts on understanding how factors such as the composition, density and geometry of tumour extracellular matrix acts to impede or promote immune cell infiltration and activation, and work to design novel pharmacological interventions which restore and enhance leucocyte trafficking within solid tumours. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Forces in cancer: interdisciplinary approaches in tumour mechanobiology'.

What is new about the molecular genetics in matrix-producing soft tissue tumors? -The contributions to pathogenetic understanding and diagnostic classification.tSoft tissue tumors encompass a wide variety of mesenchymal neoplasms exhibiting diverse clinical, pathologic, and molecular features. Among these, osteoid and/or chondroid matrix deposition in some soft tissue tumors represents a noticeable characteristic. Unlike matrices present in bone tumors where they likely reveal the respective cells of origin (i.e., osteoblastic or chondroblastic precursors), those existing in soft tissue tumors more often denote a metaplastic phenomenon and reflect the diversity of differentiation these tumors can display. While many soft tissue tumor types can occasionally harbor metaplastic bone or cartilage as an incidental component or heterologous differentiation, in some other tumor types, the production of these matrices is a frequent and distinctive, if not diagnostic, feature. This review focuses on the latter tumor types where emerging immunohistochemical and molecular evidence has significantly improved our understanding of their respective pathogenesis and histopathological spectra. These tumor types include ossifying fibromyxoid tumor, phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor, synovial chondromatosis, soft tissue chondroma, calcifying aponeurotic fibroma, giant cell tumor of soft tissue, myositis ossificans and related diseases, mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, and extraskeletal osteosarcoma.

The Combination Strategy of Transarterial Chemoembolization and Radiofrequency Ablation or Microwave Ablation against Hepatocellular Carcinoma.tHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary cancer of the liver. Hepatectomy and liver transplantation (LT) are regarded as the radical treatment, but great majority of patients are already in advanced stage on the first diagnosis and lose the surgery opportunity. Multifarious image-guided interventional therapies, termed as locoregional ablations, are recommended by various HCC guidelines for the clinical practice. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is firstly recommended for intermediate-stage (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) B class) HCC but has lower necrosis rates. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is effective in treating HCCs smaller than 3 cm in size. Microwave ablation (MWA) can ablate larger tumor within a shorter time. Combination of TACE with RFA or MWA is effective and promising in treating larger HCC lesions but needs more clinical data to confirm its long-term outcome. The combination of TACE and RFA or MWA against hepatocellular carcinoma needs more clinical data for a better strategy. The characters and advantages of TACE, RFA, MWA, and TACE combined with RFA or MWA are reviewed to provide physician a better background on decision.

Metabolomic profiling in neuroblastoma.tPrevious studies on several cancer types show that metabolomics provides a potentially useful noninvasive screening approach for outcome prediction and accurate response to treatment assessment. Neuroblastoma (NB) accounts for at least 15% of cancer-related deaths in children. Although current risk-based treatment approaches in NB have resulted in improved outcome, survival for high-risk patients remains poor. This study aims to evaluate the use of metabolomics for improving patients' risk-group stratification and outcome prediction in NB.||||Plasma samples from 110 patients with NB were collected at diagnosis prior to starting therapy and at the end of treatment if available. Metabolomic analysis of samples was carried out by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS).||||The metabolomic analysis was able to identify different plasma metabolic profiles in high-risk and low-risk NB patients at diagnosis. The metabolic model correctly classified 16 high-risk and 15 low-risk samples in an external validation set providing 84.2% sensitivity (60.4-96.6, 95% CI) and 93.7% specificity (69.8-99.8, 95% CI). Metabolomic profiling could also discriminate high-risk patients with active disease from those in remission. Notably, a plasma metabolomic signature at diagnosis identified a subset of high-risk NB patients who progressed during treatment.||||To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest NB study investigating the prognostic power of plasma metabolomics. Our results support the potential of metabolomic profiling for improving NB risk-group stratification and outcome prediction. Additional validating studies with a large cohort are needed.

Adjuvant Therapy Options in Renal Cell Carcinoma: Where Do We Stand?tAdjuvant therapy for non-metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains controversial. Of the four reported randomized controlled trials evaluating adjuvant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition, only one met its primary endpoint. The S-TRAC study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) of greater than 1 year with adjuvant sunitinib compared to placebo in patients with high-risk localized RCC and earned it FDA approval. However, the larger ASSURE study which reported first did not find a difference in DFS or overall survival between 1 year of adjuvant sunitinib or sorafenib compared to placebo. Given the discordant results of the two sunitinib studies, two other negative studies of adjuvant targeted therapy with pazopanib and axitinib, the lack of definite overall survival benefit in any study, and the high incidence of treatment-related adverse events with sunitinib, we do not recommend the routine use of adjuvant sunitinib. The decision to offer adjuvant sunitinib should be considered on an individual basis after an informed discussion of the potential toxicities and the risk/benefit ratio. Despite numerous efforts and recently published works, there is a paucity of prognostic and predictive molecular biomarkers in RCC. Further investigation is needed to discover new tools that can enhance the identification of patients who are most likely to benefit from adjuvant treatment beyond pathologic stage. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have great potential to significantly improve outcomes in high-risk localized RCC. Building on their established efficacy in the metastatic setting, several ongoing clinical trials are evaluating their value as single agents or in combination in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. At this time, we recommend participation in clinical trials as the preferred therapeutic option for patients with high-risk, non-metastatic RCC planned for nephrectomy.

Body composition changes assessment by bioelectrical impedance vectorial analysis in right heart failure and left heart failure.tHeart Failure (HF) patients developed changes in body composition as overhydration, muscle-skeletal wear and cardiac cachexia (CC). The possible factors involved in the development of CC in Right Heart Failure (RHF) patients are venous congestion, nutrient malabsorption. However, in HF, the overhydration obscure the loss of fat-free mass and difficult the body composition assessment.

The prognostic effect of adjuvant chemotherapy in the colon cancer patients with solitary lymph node metastasis.tPrevious studies have reported paradoxical survival prognoses for some node-negative and node-positive colon cancer patients. However, current guidelines recommend adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) only for node-positive patients. This study investigated the efficacy of adjuvant CT for patients who underwent radical surgery for colon cancer with solitary lymph node (LN) metastasis.||||This study included 281 patients treated between 2004 and 2015. Patients were classified into no-CT (n = 39) and CT (n = 242) groups, and the survival outcomes and recurrence-related follow-up data were analyzed.||||The groups exhibited similarities in tumor sidedness, tumor differentiation, and pathologic stage. However, the age, ASA class, and preoperative CEA level were relatively lower in the CT group. Although the CT group had a higher 5-year overall survival (OS) rate than the no-CT group (88.4% vs. 65.3%, p < 0.001), the groups did not differ in terms of 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) (CT, 84.1% vs. no-CT, 83.3%, p = 0.490). A multivariate analysis identified adjuvant CT as an independent factor for OS but not for DFS. A highly examined LN count (≥ 12) was associated with improved DFS improvement. However, D3 LN dissection was not associated with DFS or OS. For DFS, intermediate/apical positive LNs received a high hazard ratio relative to pericolic/epicolic LNs (2.080, 95% confidence interval: 0.979-4.416), but this was not significant (p = 0.057).||||Adjuvant chemotherapy did not provide clear advantages for colon cancer with solitary LN metastasis. Further large studies that analyze several prognostic factors are needed to establish tailored adjuvant CT administration guidelines.

Generation of Organoids from Mouse Extrahepatic Bile Ducts.tCholangiopathies, which affect extrahepatic bile ducts (EHBDs), include biliary atresia, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and cholangiocarcinoma. They have no effective therapeutic options. Tools to study EHBD are very limited. Our purpose was to develop an organ-specific, versatile, adult stem cell-derived, preclinical cholangiocyte model that can be easily generated from wild type and genetically engineered mice. Thus, we report on the novel technique of developing an EHBD organoid (EHBDO) culture system from adult mouse EHBDs. The model is cost-efficient, able to be readily analyzed, and has multiple downstream applications. Specifically, we describe the methodology of mouse EHBD isolation and single cell dissociation, organoid culture initiation, propagation, and long-term maintenance and storage. This manuscript also describes EHBDO processing for immunohistochemistry, fluorescent microscopy, and mRNA abundance quantitation by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). This protocol has significant advantages in addition to producing EHBD-specific organoids. The use of a conditioned medium from L-WRN cells significantly reduces the cost of this model. The use of mouse EHBDs provides almost unlimited tissue for culture generation, unlike human tissue. Generated mouse EHBDOs contain a pure population of epithelial cells with markers of endodermal progenitor and differentiated biliary cells. Cultured organoids maintain homogenous morphology through multiple passages and can be recovered after a long-term storage period in liquid nitrogen. The model allows for the study of biliary progenitor cell proliferation, can be manipulated pharmacologically, and may be generated from genetically engineered mice. Future studies are needed to optimize culture conditions in order to increase plating efficiency, evaluate functional cell maturity, and direct cell differentiation. Development of co-culture models and a more biologically neutral extracellular matrix are also desirable.

Is optical coherence tomography angiography helpful in the differential diagnosis of choroidal nevus versus melanoma?tTo describe the imaging features of choroidal nevus and melanoma using optical coherence tomography angiography, and evaluate the ability of this technique to establish the differential diagnosis based on the display of the tumor's intrinsic vasculature.||||Comparative analysis of optical coherence tomography angiography findings in consecutive patients diagnosed with choroidal nevus or choroidal melanoma following a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including best-corrected visual acuity and several imaging studies: color fundus photography, B-scan ultrasound, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, and optical coherence tomography angiography. Optical coherence tomography angiography was used to investigate qualitative differences in the tumor vasculature.||||Thirty-six eyes (18 cases of choroidal nevus and 18 cases of choroidal melanoma) from 36 consecutive patients were included in the study. Only cases located posterior to equator were included to enable performance of all tests. On optical coherence tomography angiography, choroidal nevus showed well-delimited margins (78%), hyperreflective choroid capillary vasculature (83%), fewer avascular areas (17%), and neovascular membrane in one case (6%). Choroidal melanoma showed imprecise margins (72%), hyporeflective choroidal capillary vasculature (72%), multiple avascular areas (78%), and choroidal vascular changes (e.g. thick vascular networks or vascular loops; 45%).||||Optical coherence tomography angiography can provide useful information for assessing and differentiating between choroidal nevi and small melanomas. Significant differences between these conditions were found for the pattern of reflectivity, and presence/absence of avascular zones and vascular anomalies, which could be helpful for supporting the diagnosis.

A twelve-year study of the prevalence, risk factors and characteristics of interval colorectal cancers after negative colonoscopy.tThe objective of our study was to describe and analyse the Post-Colonoscopy Colorectal Cancers (PCCRCs) and endoscopist performance-related risk factors in the Isère regional screening programme.||||This was a population-based retrospective cohort study between 2002-2013, where Post-Colonoscopy Colorectal Cancers (PCCRCs) were defined as colorectal adenocarcinoma diagnosed between six and sixty months post-colonoscopy following a positive gFOBT. We analysed the endoscopist performance-related risk factors of the 62 gastroenterologists who had carried out at least 30 colonoscopies during this period.||||During the period reviewed, there were 10,557 negative colonoscopies performed. Fifteen post-colonoscopy colorectal cancers were diagnosed from 2002-2013 with an average patient age of 67.1 years. Men comprised 73% of the cases and 53% of all the cases were found in the distal colon. These 15 cases comprised 1.1% of all Colorectal Cancers (CRCs) diagnosed in the screening programme, with an incidence rate of 0.42 (0.21-0.77) per 1,000 person-years. The aetiological breakdown was as follows: 47% related to missed cancers, 27% were new cancers, 20% were failed biopsy detection, and 6% related to incomplete removal. The Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR) among gastroenterologists was an average of 30%, but large heterogeneity was present within this number, ranging from 11% to 49%.||||The post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer prevalence and incident rate were low relative to the literature. However, significant heterogeneity was present in the adenoma detection rate. Decreasing this heterogeneity by establishing a national benchmark, regular performance feedback and training modules should homogenise adenoma detection rates and decrease the number of interval cancers in the region.

LAY SUMMARY: Middle-income countries often lack validated tools to evaluate autism symptoms.	The reliability and validity of the social responsiveness scale to measure autism symptomology in Vietnamese children.tThe Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) has been validated in high-income countries but not yet in low- and middle-income countries. We aimed to assess the reliability of the SRS in a community sample and its validity to discriminate between children with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in Vietnam. We used a three-phase study: piloting the translated SRS, reliability testing, and validation of the SRS in 158 Vietnamese caretakers and their children (ages 4-9 years). We examined reliability, validity and sensitivity, and specificity to ASD diagnosis. We applied receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis to determine optimal cutoff scores discriminating the children with ASD from those without ASD. We also assessed the performance of the SRS short form. We found that reliability was good with high internal consistency (0.88-0.89), test-retest reliability (0.82-0.83), sensitivity (93%), and specificity (98%) for identification of children with ASD. The ROC curves were similar for total raw score and total T-score, with the area under the curve (AUC) values reaching 0.98 and the optimal cutoff of 62 for raw scores and 60 for T-scores. The SRS short form also performed well in distinguishing children with ASD from children without ASD, with high AUC (0.98), sensitivity (90%), and specificity (98%) when using a raw score of 15 as a cutoff. In conclusion, the translated and culturally adapted SRS shows good reliability, validity, and sensitivity for identification of children with ASD in Vietnam. Both SRS long and short forms performed adequately to discriminate between children with and without ASD.

The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) translated to Vietnamese was reliable and performed well to distinguish between children with and without autism spectrum disorder in Vietnam. The Vietnamese SRS, and translations of the tool to other languages with this methodology, may be useful in pediatric practice, potentially allowing providers to make more appropriate referrals for diagnostic evaluations and identify children for intervention to help them fulfill their developmental potential.

Central nervous system diseases of cattle in Georgia, 2001-2017.tIn a review of 159 archived bovine autopsy cases submitted to the Georgia Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System from 2001 to 2017, we evaluated histologic lesions and other laboratory test results in cases diagnosed with central nervous system (CNS) disease to determine the most common disorders and the rate of definitive morphologic and etiologic diagnosis within the population. The most common breed was Aberdeen Angus or Angus (31%), and female animals comprised 60% of the overall submissions. Gross anatomic changes were described in 33% of cases that had histologic lesions. Suppurative meningoencephalitis was the most common diagnosis (28% of cases overall) and was frequently associated with bacterial sepsis. Lymphocytic meningoencephalitis without an identified etiology was diagnosed in 17% of cases. Polioencephalomalacia was the most commonly identified noninfectious diagnosis (17%). Hydrocephalus was the most common CNS comorbidity and potential congenital defect. Identification of specific agents was sporadic, and infectious disease testing was largely dependent on fluorescent antibody testing, almost all of which were negative. Our findings indicate the common differential diagnoses for cattle with neurologic signs in the southeastern United States, as well the need for a well-defined, methodical diagnostic approach, including autopsy, histology, and appropriate additional laboratory testing.

MRI-based 3D-printed surgical guides for breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.tMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most accurate technique for evaluating residual tumor after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, precise determination of the extent of dispersed residual tumor in the breast following treatment remains a difficult task. We hereby introduce three-dimensional (3D)-printed surgical guides for use in breast cancer patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We prospectively applied the 3D-printed surgical guides on breast cancer patients who underwent partial breast resection after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Breasts and tumors were modeled in 3D by using pretreatment magnetic resonance images, and surgical guides were created by using a 3D printer to mark the primary tumor. Out of the five patients who participated in the study, all patients had clear resection margins, and two patients experienced complete pathological remission. There were no recurrences during the median follow-up period of 21.9 months. Thus, our newly-developed 3D-printed surgical guides were useful for accurately marking the extent of breast tumor based on pretreatment magnetic resonance images, which is important for designating the extent of surgery needed in patients who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Safety, clinical activity and biomarker assessments of atezolizumab from a Phase I study in advanced/recurrent ovarian and uterine cancers.tPatients with advanced/recurrent epithelial ovarian and uterine cancers have limited treatment options beyond platinum chemotherapy. Both tumor types can express programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), providing a potential therapeutic target for these patients. Here we present data from the ovarian and uterine cancer cohorts of the Phase I atezolizumab monotherapy study (PCD4989g).||||This Phase I, multi-center, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation/expansion clinical trial investigated single-agent atezolizumab in cohorts of patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian or uterine cancer. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single-agent atezolizumab. Anti-tumor activity and preliminary assessment of potential biomarkers were evaluated as secondary and exploratory objectives, respectively.||||The ovarian and uterine cancer cohorts enrolled 12 and 15 patients, respectively (10 [83%] and 5 [33%], respectively, had PD-L1 ≥ 5% on tumor-infiltrating immune cells). Atezolizumab was generally well tolerated with no new safety signals identified. The safety profiles in both cohorts were consistent with the known profile of atezolizumab monotherapy. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were mostly Grade ≤ 2, with no treatment-related Grade ≥ 4 AEs reported. Preliminary anti-tumor activity, with long durations of response, was observed in 2 patients from each cohort (ovarian cancer, 8.1 and 30.6+ months; uterine cancer, 7.3 and 16.6+ months). High microsatellite instability and tumor mutational burden were noted in the responders from the uterine cancer cohort.||||Atezolizumab monotherapy was well tolerated in patients with epithelial ovarian or uterine cancer and may have clinical activity warranting further investigation.||||ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01375842.

Influence of Taxanes on Treatment Sequence in Gastric Cancer.tAdenocarcinoma of the stomach and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) remains a tumor entity with a poor prognosis. While meaningful advances have been made in the treatment of other solid tumors in the past years, numerous phase III studies in gastric cancer have had negative outcomes. Successes of targeted therapies so far include the -introduction of trastuzumab in the first-line treatment of HER2-positive gastric cancer, and second-line anti-angiogenic treatment with the anti-VEGF-2 receptor antibody ramucirumab. Taxanes have become established in the perioperative setting and in second-line treatment and have set new standards. However, evidence for improved overall survival in the first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer with taxanes is not convincing.||||Expert consensus discussion on the scientific and clinical evidence for sequential systemic treatment for advanced gastric and EGJ cancer, taking into account data clinical outcomes from randomized controlled phase II and phase III trials.||||In first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer, taxanes in combination with a platinum- and 5-fluorouracil-based regimen are generally not recommended because they lack a survival benefit and confer high toxicity. However, taxanes in first-line can be a treatment option for patients presenting with high tumor burden and strong pressure to achieve remission. Since the publication of several positive studies in second- and third-line therapy, sequential therapy is playing an increasingly important role in metastatic gastric and EGJ cancer. Key Message: Standard of care for the first-line treatment of gastric cancer is a platinum-fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy doublet combination. The standard of care after failure of platinum-based first-line therapy is ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel. Data supporting this combination after previous taxane therapy are not yet available.

Quantitative associations between health insurance and stage of melanoma at diagnosis among nonelderly adults in the United States.tHealth insurance plays a critical role in the accessibility to and quality of health care for patients with melanoma in the United States. Current knowledge regarding the association between insurance status and stage of melanoma is limited because few studies to date have simultaneously controlled for factors known to influence the risk of diagnosis of late-stage melanoma. The current study was conducted to examine the association between health insurance status and stage of melanoma at the time of diagnosis in nonelderly adults, accounting for known risk factors for late-stage diagnosis.||||In this cross-sectional study, the authors analyzed the National Cancer Data Base for cases of invasive melanoma diagnosed between 2004 and 2015 among individuals aged 26 to 64 years. Using the American Joint Committee on Cancer melanoma staging system, early-stage melanoma was defined as stage I or stage II whereas late-stage melanoma was defined as stage III or stage IV. Late-stage diagnosis was the primary outcome compared across 4 insurance types (private, Medicaid, none, and unknown). Adjusted covariates were age, sex, race/ethnicity, educational level, income, year of diagnosis, number of comorbidities, and facility location. Logistic regression was used for univariable and multivariable analyses.||||Among 177,247 cases, individuals with Medicaid or no health insurance were found to have 3.12 (95% CI, 2.97-3.28) and 2.21 (95% CI, 2.10-2.33) times greater odds, respectively, of being diagnosed with late-stage melanoma compared with individuals with private insurance after adjusting for risk factors in late-stage diagnosis.||||Future investigation into insurance disparities in the diagnosis of late-stage melanoma may help to prioritize melanoma screening in populations with nonprivate insurance.

PARP Inhibitors in Prostate Cancer—The Preclinical Rationale and Current Clinical Development.tProstate cancer is globally the second most commonly diagnosed cancer type in men. Recent studies suggest that mutations in DNA repair genes are associated with aggressive forms of prostate cancer and castration resistance. Prostate cancer with DNA repair defects may be vulnerable to therapeutic targeting by Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. PARP enzymes modify target proteins with ADP-ribose in a process called PARylation and are in particular involved in single strand break repair. The rationale behind the clinical trials that led to the current use of PARP inhibitors to treat cancer was to target the dependence of BRCA-mutant cancer cells on the PARP-associated repair pathway due to deficiency in homologous recombination. However, recent studies have proposed therapeutic potential for PARP inhibitors in tumors with a variety of vulnerabilities generating dependence on PARP beyond the synthetic lethal targeting of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutated tumors, suggesting a wider potential than initially thought. Importantly, PARP-associated DNA repair pathways are also closely connected to androgen receptor (AR) signaling, which is a key regulator of tumor growth and a central therapeutic target in prostate cancer. In this review, we provide an extensive overview of published and ongoing trials exploring PARP inhibitors in treatment of prostate cancer and discuss the underlying biology. Several clinical trials are currently studying PARP inhibitor mono- and combination therapies in the treatment of prostate cancer. Integration of drugs targeting DNA repair pathways in prostate cancer treatment modalities allows developing of more personalized care taking also into account the genetic makeup of individual tumors.

Cardiovascular disease risk factor burden and cognition: Implications of ethnic diversity within the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos.tHispanics/Latinos have some of the highest prevalence rates for cardiovascular disease risk factors, but stark differences exist by self-reported background. Cardiovascular disease risk factors negatively impact cognition in Hispanics/Latinos; less is known about these relationships by Hispanic/Latino backgrounds. We investigated cognitive associations with cardiovascular disease risk factor burden in a diverse cohort, the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos.||||Baseline data from this observational study of cardiovascular disease and its antecedents was collected from 2008-2011. We included 7,121 participants 45-74 years old from Central American, Cuban, Dominican, Mexican, Puerto Rican, or South American backgrounds. Dichotomous indicators for hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and smoking were evaluated and totaled, with participants grouped by lowest (0-2), middle (3) or highest (4-5) burden. Cognitive testing included the Brief Spanish English Verbal Learning Test, letter fluency, and digit symbol substitution.||||In separate fully-adjusted linear regression models, lower fluency and digit symbol substitution performance were restricted to the highest compared to the lowest burden group; whereas the middle burden group displayed impaired memory performance compared to the lowest burden group (p-values≤0.05). Background interacted with burden for learning and memory performance. That is, the association of burden level (i.e., lowest, middle, or highest) with cognitive performance was modified by background (e.g., Mexicans vs Cuban).||||Hispanics/Latinos with higher levels of cardiovascular disease risk factor burden displayed lower levels of cognitive performance, with learning and memory performance modified by background.

Diagnostic Evaluation of Isotropic 3D MRCP Images in the Diagnosis of Cholangiocarcinoma.tThis is a cross sectional study to establish that Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) could be accepted as the most effective imaging modality for the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. Cholangiocarcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of the bile duct. It is much less common than hepatocellular carcinoma, accounting for 5-30% of all hepatic malignancies. Clinically suspected patients with obstructive jaundice due to cholangiocarcinoma were referred to the Department of Radiology and Imaging, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh. The study was carried out in 60 patients, of which 38(63%) were male and 22(37%) were female. Out of 60 cases 56 cases were truly diagnosed by MRCP, 4 were normal, among these 1 case was diagnosed as cholangiocarcinoma as compared with histopathology. Forty four (44) patients (73.2%) of the patients were in sixth decade of life. The overall sensitivity and specificity were found to be 98.2% and 75%. The diagnostic accuracy was 96.7% & positive predictive value was about 98%.

Toll-like receptors: The role in bladder cancer development, progression and immunotherapy.tBladder cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The main immune mechanisms which lead to bladder cancer development or treatment outcomes have yet to be elucidated. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play key roles against cancer. TLRs are expressed both on immune cells and on tumour cells and drive immune responses in progression as well as treatment of cancer. Identification of signalling pathways via TLRs could revolutionize further improvement of therapeutic strategies against cancers in the future. According to the recent studies, TLRs agonists are effective immunostimulants and have important role in induction of immune responses with immunotherapeutic potential against several diseases including cancer. They play an important role in the bladder urothelium as a part of immune defence against uropathogens. On the other hand, decreased TLRs expression was found in bladder tumours, particularly in non-muscle-invasive ones. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) (agonist of TLR2 and TLR4) is approved by US FDA for immunotherapy of bladder cancer. Despite high efficiency, immunotherapy with BCG may cause toxicity and adverse effects. Nowadays, in vitro and in vivo studies have been conducted to find alternative options for non-responder patients. Studies on TLR agonists for bladder cancer treatment have shown promising results. In this review, we discuss recent data about mechanisms played by TLRs in bladder cancer developments as well as therapeutic application of TLR agonists in cancer treatment.

Therefore, it is of great interest to understand how obesity-induced stress modulates antioxidant enzyme activity during puberty. To this end, 27 severely obese adolescents (body mass index > 30, z-score > 3.7) were recruited from a paediatric weight management centre. Eighteen were recruited during the summer and nine in the winter. All underwent a 4-month weight loss programme consisting in diet and physical activity. Twenty normal-weight age-matched adolescents were recruited from the same geographical area to serve as controls. Blood samples were extracted, and antioxidant enzyme activities were determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and erythrocytes. The enzymes studied included catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase. Severely obese adolescents presented lower PBMC-glutathione reductase activity than their corresponding normal-weight counterparts. In addition, glutathione-dependent activities tended to be lower in both groups during the winter compared with summer. These changes coincided with differences in circulating vitamin D levels. Results may suggest that season-dependent factors such as vitamin D could affect glutathione-dependent activities in severely obese as well as in normal-weight adolescents.

Serum triglycerides, cholesterol (total, high density lipoprotein, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol) and fasting blood glucose were assayed. Metabolic syndrome has been diagnosed in the presence of at least three of the following criteria: increased waist circumference, high triglycerides, fasting glucose or arterial blood pressure and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol.||||The present study reports that infertile men are in poorer health condition compared to fertile men and are more often smokers.

The panniculus carnosus muscle: A novel model of striated muscle regeneration that exhibits sex differences in the mdx mouse.tThe dermal striated muscle panniculus carnosus (PC), prevalent in lower mammals with remnants in humans, is highly regenerative, and whose function is purported to be linked to defence and shivering thermogenesis. Given the heterogeneity of responses of different muscles to disease, we set out to characterize the PC in wild-type and muscular dystrophic mdx mice. The mouse PC contained mainly fast-twitch type IIB myofibers showing body wide distribution. The PC exemplified heterogeneity in myofiber sizes and a prevalence of central nucleated fibres (CNFs), hallmarks of regeneration, in wild-type and mdx muscles, which increased with age. PC myofibers were hypertrophic in mdx compared to wild-type mice. Sexual dimorphism was apparent with a two-fold increase in CNFs in PC from male versus female mdx mice. To evaluate myogenic potential, PC muscle progenitors were isolated from 8-week old wild-type and mdx mice, grown and differentiated for 7-days. Myogenic profiling of PC-derived myocytes suggested that male mdx satellite cells (SCs) were more myogenic than female counterparts, independent of SC density in PC muscles. Muscle regenerative differences in the PC were associated with alterations in expression of calcium handling regulatory proteins. These studies highlight unique aspects of the PC muscle and its potential as a model to study mechanisms of striated muscle regeneration in health and disease.

The reliability and validity of the social responsiveness scale to measure autism symptomology in Vietnamese children.tThe Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) has been validated in high-income countries but not yet in low- and middle-income countries. We aimed to assess the reliability of the SRS in a community sample and its validity to discriminate between children with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in Vietnam. We used a three-phase study: piloting the translated SRS, reliability testing, and validation of the SRS in 158 Vietnamese caretakers and their children (ages 4-9 years). We examined reliability, validity and sensitivity, and specificity to ASD diagnosis. We applied receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis to determine optimal cutoff scores discriminating the children with ASD from those without ASD. We also assessed the performance of the SRS short form. We found that reliability was good with high internal consistency (0.88-0.89), test-retest reliability (0.82-0.83), sensitivity (93%), and specificity (98%) for identification of children with ASD. The ROC curves were similar for total raw score and total T-score, with the area under the curve (AUC) values reaching 0.98 and the optimal cutoff of 62 for raw scores and 60 for T-scores. The SRS short form also performed well in distinguishing children with ASD from children without ASD, with high AUC (0.98), sensitivity (90%), and specificity (98%) when using a raw score of 15 as a cutoff. In conclusion, the translated and culturally adapted SRS shows good reliability, validity, and sensitivity for identification of children with ASD in Vietnam. Both SRS long and short forms performed adequately to discriminate between children with and without ASD. Autism Res 2019, 00: 1-13. © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Middle-income countries often lack validated tools to evaluate autism symptoms. The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) translated to Vietnamese was reliable and performed well to distinguish between children with and without autism spectrum disorder in Vietnam. The Vietnamese SRS, and translations of the tool to other languages with this methodology, may be useful in pediatric practice, potentially allowing providers to make more appropriate referrals for diagnostic evaluations and identify children for intervention to help them fulfill their developmental potential.

Drug repurposing for breast cancer therapy: Old weapon for new battle.tDespite tremendous resources being invested in prevention and treatment, breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer deaths in women globally. The available treatment modalities are very costly and produces severe side effects. Drug repurposing that relate to new uses for old drugs has emerged as a novel approach for drug development. Repositioning of old, clinically approved, off patent non-cancer drugs with known targets, into newer indication is like using old weapons for new battle. The advances in genomics, proteomics and information computational biology has facilitated the process of drug repurposing. Repositioning approach not only fastens the process of drug development but also offers more effective, cheaper, safer drugs with lesser/known side effects. During the last decade, drugs such as alkylating agents, anthracyclins, antimetabolite, CDK4/6 inhibitor, aromatase inhibitor, mTOR inhibitor and mitotic inhibitors has been repositioned for breast cancer treatment. The repositioned drugs have been successfully used for the treatment of most aggressive triple negative breast cancer. The literature review suggest that serendipity plays a major role in the drug development. This article describes the comprehensive overview of the current scenario of drug repurposing for the breast cancer treatment. The strategies as well as several examples of repurposed drugs are provided. The challenges associated with drug repurposing are discussed.

However, timely diagnosis and treatment with replacement steroids are needed to prevent fatal adrenal crisis. While the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency in childhood is congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a significant minority (13-23%) is caused by autoimmune destruction of the gland. We present a case of a 4-year-old, previously healthy child who had a one-day history of nausea and vomiting, and was found unresponsive by her caretaker. Despite emergency rescue and transport to the hospital, she was pronounced dead. At autopsy, the adrenal glands were atrophied. Histologic examination revealed lymphocytic infiltration of the adrenal glands consistent with autoimmune adrenal insufficiency. Fecal viral antigen testing was positive for rotavirus. The cause of death was determined to be adrenal crisis in the setting of rotavirus gastroenteritis due to adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease).

Proteomic Biomarkers for the Detection of Endometrial Cancer.tEndometrial cancer is the leading gynaecological malignancy in the western world and its incidence is rising in tandem with the global epidemic of obesity. Early diagnosis is key to improving survival, which at 5 years is less than 20% in advanced disease and over 90% in early-stage disease. As yet, there are no validated biological markers for its early detection. Advances in high-throughput technologies and machine learning techniques now offer unique and promising perspectives for biomarker discovery, especially through the integration of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and imaging data. Because the proteome closely mirrors the dynamic state of cells, tissues and organisms, proteomics has great potential to deliver clinically relevant biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. In this review, we present the current progress in endometrial cancer diagnostic biomarker discovery using proteomics. We describe the various mass spectrometry-based approaches and highlight the challenges inherent in biomarker discovery studies. We suggest novel strategies for endometrial cancer detection exploiting biologically important protein biomarkers and set the scene for future directions in endometrial cancer biomarker research.

Heterogeneity of human prostate carcinoma-associated fibroblasts implicates a role for subpopulations in myeloid cell recruitment.tCarcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are a heterogeneous group of cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) that can promote tumorigenesis in the prostate. By understanding the mechanism(s) by which CAF contributes to tumor growth, new therapeutic targets for the management of this disease may be identified. These studies determined whether unique sub-populations of human prostate CAF can be identified and functionally characterized.||||Single-cell RNA-seq of primary human prostate CAF followed by unsupervised clustering was utilized to generate cell clusters based on differentially expressed (DE) gene profiles. Potential communication between CAF and immune cells was analyzed using in vivo tissue recombination by combining CAF or normal prostate fibroblasts (NPF) with non-tumorigenic, initiated prostate epithelial BPH-1 cells. Resultant grafts were assessed for inflammatory cell recruitment.||||Clustering of 3321 CAF allows for visualization of six subpopulations, demonstrating heterogeneity within CAF. Sub-renal capsule recombination assays show that the presence of CAF significantly increases myeloid cell recruitment to resultant tumors. This is supported by significantly increased expression of chemotactic chemokines CCL2 and CXCL12 in large clusters compared to other subpopulations. Bayesian analysis topologies also support differential communication signals between chemokine-related genes of individual clusters. Migration of THP-1 monocyte cells in vitro is stimulated in the presence of CAF conditioned medium (CM) compared with NPF CM. Further in vitro analyses suggest that CAF-derived chemokine CCL2 may be responsible for CAF-stimulated migration of THP-1 cells, since neutralization of this chemokine abrogates migration capacity.||||CAF clustering based on DE gene expression supports the concept that clusters have unique functions within the TME, including a role in immune/inflammatory cell recruitment. These data suggest that CCL2 produced by CAF may be involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells, but may also directly regulate the growth of the tumor. Further studies aimed at characterizing the subpopulation(s) of CAF which promote immune cell recruitment to the TME and/or stimulate prostate cancer growth and progression will be pursued.

Resistant Ventricular Arrhythmia and the Role of Overdrive Pacing in the Suppression of the Electrical Storm.tVentricular arrhythmia storm is a state of cardiac instability characterized by multiple ventricular arrhythmias or multiple ICD therapies within a 24-hour duration. Management of this life-threatening state depends on the reversal of the cause besides either electrical or medical management of the arrhythmia. We report a case of a 54-year-old male who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention following massive acute myocardial infarction. Afterwards, he developed frequent life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias that required multiple shocks and antiarrhythmic medications. Despite all these interventions, it was very difficult to control the electrical instability, but after overdrive ventricular pacing, the storm subsided and within a few days the case was stabilized. Overdrive pacing is an easy temporary modality to control the resistant arrhythmia following myocardial infarction.

The aim of this study was to investigate inhibitory effects of stylosin and some similar synthetic monoterpenoids on 15-LOX and also their cytotoxic and anti-cancer activities on prostate cancer cells. Cytotoxicity of compounds was evaluated on prostate cancer cell line "PC-3" and normal human fibroblast "HFF3" cells using AlamarBlue reduction test. The inhibitory effects of the compounds against soybean 15-LOX, a commercially available enzyme, were also assessed. Finally, mechanism of cell death was investigated by flow cytometry. Some of these terpenoids had cytotoxic effects on PC-3 cells, and strong positive correlation was observed between the 15-LOX-1 inhibition potential and the cytotoxicity of the compounds. Moreover, flow cytometry results indicated that apoptosis was the predominant mechanism of induced cell death, which emphasizes the potential of these compounds in prostate cancer therapy. Among studied terpenoids, "fenchyl ferulate" exhibited about three times more cytotoxicity than cisplatin. Strong positive correlation observed between 15-LOX inhibition potential and cytotoxicity of the compounds indicates selective anti-cancer properties of the compounds might be exerted via inhibition of 15-LOX-1 in PC-3 cells. Furthermore, observed cytotoxicity is mediated through apoptosis, which is probably triggered via 15-LOX-1 inhibition.

However, the ability of TpTe to predict ventricular tachyarrhythmia and mortality for heart failure patients with a cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is not clear. The purpose of this study was to assess the predictive ability of TpTe in heart failure patients with ICD.||||We enrolled 318 heart failure patients treated after ICD. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to their post-implantation TpTe values and were evaluated every 6 months. The primary endpoint was appropriate ICD therapy. The secondary endpoint was all-cause mortality.

Early effects of Cyclophosphamide, Methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil on neuronal morphology and hippocampal-dependent behavior in a murine model.tBreast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women. Fortunately, BC survival rates have increased since the implementation of adjuvant chemotherapy leading to a growing population of survivors. However, chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairments (CICIs) affect up to 75% of BC survivors and may be driven by inflammation and oxidative stress. CICIs can persist 20 years and hinder survivors' quality of life (QOL). To identify early effects of CMF administration in mice, we chose to evaluate adult female mice at 2-weeks post-chemotherapy. Mice received weekly IP administration of CMF (or saline) for 4 weeks, completed behavioral testing, and were sacrificed 2-weeks following their final CMF injection. Behavioral results indicated long-term memory (LTM) impairments post-chemotherapy, but did not reveal short-term memory (STM) deficits. Dendritic morphology and spine data found increases in overall spine density within CA1 basal and CA3 basal dendrites, but no changes in DG, CA1 apical, or CA3 apical dendrites. Further analysis revealed decreases in arborization across the hippocampus (DG, CA1 apical and basal, CA3 apical and basal). These physiological changes within the hippocampus correlate with our behavioral data indicating LTM impairments following CMF administration in female mice 2-weeks post-chemotherapy.

Iron Support in Erythropoietin Treatment in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Patients Affected by Low-Risk Refractory Anaemia: Real-Life Evidence from an Italian Setting.tRefractory anaemia (RA) among myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is associated with a partial functional iron deficit and may require transfusions. In low-risk lymphoma and solid tumour patients, iron support improves erythropoietin (EPO) cost-effectiveness in treating anaemia. The aim of this study is to see if oral sucrosomial iron support improves the cost-effectiveness of EPO treatment in MDS patients affected by low-risk RA. We treated patients with EPO only or with EPO plus oral sucrosomial iron or intravenous (i.v.) iron. The need for transfusions was lowest in the group taking oral iron (p = 0.016) or not receiving supplementation at all (p = 0.022). We compared costs of EPO with i.v. ferric gluconate or oral sucrosomial iron supplementation or no iron supplementation. The oral iron group had fewer side effects, fewer patient medical visits in the out-patient setting, and fewer transfusions; this led to higher savings on direct hospital costs and indirect patient costs (lost days at work) and translated into a 50% abatement of overall expenditures. EPO treatment-related expenditures in MDS-RA patients were lowest with oral sucrosomial iron supplementation (Sideral®), with a longer interval between EPO administration in maintenance treatment, quicker hemoglobin recovery, lower ferritin increase and fewer blood transfusions.

The E2F3/miR-125a/DKK3 regulatory axis promotes the development and progression of gastric cancer.tGastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant tumours with high mortality and metastasis rates. E2F3, miR-125a and DKK3 have been reported to be involved in various cancer types, but their detailed roles in GC have not been fully understood.||||A QRT-PCR assay was used to examine the expression of E2F3, miR-125a and DKK3 in metastatic and nonmetastatic GC tissues. DKK3 plasmids, DKK3 shRNA, miR-125a mimic and miR-125a inhibitor were transfected into BGC823 cells to evaluate the biological functions of DKK3 and miR-125a. A scratch wound healing assay and Transwell assay were utilized to determine the migratory and invasive ability of BGC823 cells transfected with the DKK3 plasmids, DKK3 shRNA, miR-125a mimic and miR-125a inhibitor. Moreover, qRT-PCR and WB analysis were used to analyse the mRNA and protein expression levels of metastasis-related genes after proper transfection. The target relationship between miR-125a and the DKK3 mRNA 3'UTR was determined by a dual luciferase reporter assay, while the interaction between E2F3 and miR-125a was analysed by a ChIP assay.||||The clinical data showed that the DKK3 expression level in metastatic GC samples was significantly less than that in nonmetastatic GC samples, whereas the E2F3 and miR-125a expression levels in metastatic GC samples were notably greater than those in nonmetastatic GC samples. Moreover, knockdown of DKK3 and overexpression of miR-125a markedly promoted the migratory and invasive abilities of GC cells. Additionally, the protein and mRNA expression levels of metastasis-related genes, including N-cadherin, Vimentin, MMP2 and MMP9, were markedly decreased in the DKK3 and miR-125a inhibitor groups compared to their control groups and markedly increased in the DKK3 shRNA and miR-125a groups compared with the control group. Finally, a dual luciferase reporter assay and ChIP assay showed that E2F3 binds to the miR-125a promoter and that the DKK3 mRNA 3'UTR is a direct target of miR-125a. Furthermore, analysis of Kaplan-Meier curves also confirmed the regulatory role of E2F3 on miR-125a. Additionally, BGC823 cells transfected with E2F3 plasmids and shRNA downregulated and upregulated the expression of DKK3, respectively.||||Our results suggested that E2F3 might play a tumour-promoting role in the metastasis and progression of GC by regulating the miR-125a/DKK3 axis.

Concentration- and time-dependent effects of myo-inositol on evoked epileptic afterdischarge in the hippocampus in vivo.tEpilepsy is one of the most widespread neurological diseases characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures. There is no cure for epilepsy, and available pharmacological treatments with anti-seizure drugs are only symptomatic. Moreover, about third of epilepsy patients are resistant to the anti-seizure drugs. Thus, it is essential to discover new anti-epilepsy drugs. Recently, myo-inositol has been identified as a promising antiepileptic compound. In the present study, using electrophysiological method, we examined for the first time, the effect of myo-inositol on the generation of epileptic afterdischarges in the hippocampus evoked by a local electrical stimulation. This was achieved by implanting two electrodes with a cannula into the same dorsal hippocampus, which allowed for simultaneous local injection of myo-inositol or saline and afterdischarges induction and recording from the same hippocampus. We found that myo-inositol has time- and concentration-dependent effects on the evoked afterdischarges. Specifically, 5 minutes after 1 M myo-inositol infusion, the afterdischarges duration was significantly decreased as compared to preinjection durations in the same animals and also as compared to preinjection level durations in saline injected or contralateral hippocampus myo-inositol infused animals. Further, 0.055 M myo-inositol significantly decreased afterdischarges duration at 5 minutes as compared to 40 minutes post-injection. At both concentrations, the afterdischarges duration recovered to the pre-injection value at 40 minutes after the myo-inositol injection. The present data, taken together with our previous results, strongly suggest that myo-inositol has significant local seizure-suppressant effect.

Influence of Taxanes on Treatment Sequence in Gastric Cancer.tAdenocarcinoma of the stomach and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) remains a tumor entity with a poor prognosis. While meaningful advances have been made in the treatment of other solid tumors in the past years, numerous phase III studies in gastric cancer have had negative outcomes. Successes of targeted therapies so far include the -introduction of trastuzumab in the first-line treatment of HER2-positive gastric cancer, and second-line anti-angiogenic treatment with the anti-VEGF-2 receptor antibody ramucirumab. Taxanes have become established in the perioperative setting and in second-line treatment and have set new standards. However, evidence for improved overall survival in the first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer with taxanes is not convincing.||||Expert consensus discussion on the scientific and clinical evidence for sequential systemic treatment for advanced gastric and EGJ cancer, taking into account data clinical outcomes from randomized controlled phase II and phase III trials.||||In first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer, taxanes in combination with a platinum- and 5-fluorouracil-based regimen are generally not recommended because they lack a survival benefit and confer high toxicity. However, taxanes in first-line can be a treatment option for patients presenting with high tumor burden and strong pressure to achieve remission. Since the publication of several positive studies in second- and third-line therapy, sequential therapy is playing an increasingly important role in metastatic gastric and EGJ cancer. Key Message: Standard of care for the first-line treatment of gastric cancer is a platinum-fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy doublet combination. The standard of care after failure of platinum-based first-line therapy is ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel. Data supporting this combination after previous taxane therapy are not yet available.

Hydrocephalus Secondary to Intradural Extramedullary Malignant Melanoma of Spinal Cord.tHydrocephalus secondary to spinal cord tumors is rare.||||We present a 39-year-old male with gradual-onset headache whose initial diagnosis was cerebral aneurysm and communicating hydrocephalus. The correct diagnosis was primary intradural extramedullary malignant melanoma of the spinal cord. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated slight dilation of cerebral ventricles and a 3-mm unruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm. He was placed under observation therapy. Two months later he was seen again due to severe headache. There was no intracranial hemorrhage on brain computed tomography scans. As we suspected rupture of the aneurysm, we operated on him for surgical clipping; however, there was no aneurysmal rupture. We found no lesions responsible for hydrocephalus, so we placed a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. His headache subsequently resolved. Nine months later he developed gait disturbance; a large volume of ascites was observed. Gadolinium-enhanced lumbar magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intradural extramedullary mass at the L-1 to S-5 level. Cytology and immunohistochemistry of the cerebrospinal fluid and ascites identified a few atypical cells positive for HMB-45, S-100 protein, and Melan-A. Whole-body examinations detected no primary lesions outside the central nervous system. Our final diagnosis was primary intradural extramedullary malignant melanoma of the spinal cord with cerebrospinal fluid dissemination.||||Our findings indicate that communicating hydrocephalus may be due to primary malignant melanoma of the spinal cord.

The Chick Chorioallantoic Membrane In Vivo Model to Assess Perineural Invasion in Head and Neck Cancer.tPerineural invasion is a phenotype in which cancer surrounds or invades the nerves. It is associated with poor clinical outcome for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and other cancers. Mechanistic studies have shown that the molecular crosstalk between nerves and tumor cells occurs prior to physical interaction. There are only a few in vivo models to study perineural invasion, especially to investigate early progression, before physical nerve-tumor interactions occur. The chick chorioallantoic membrane model has been used to study cancer invasion, because the basement membrane of the chorionic epithelium mimics that of human epithelial tissue. Here we repurposed the chick chorioallantoic membrane model to investigate perineural invasion, grafting rat dorsal root ganglia and human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells onto the chorionic epithelium. We have demonstrated how this model can be useful to evaluate the ability of cancer cells to invade neural tissue in vivo.

Recent Advances and Therapeutic Options in Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome.tLambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune-mediated neurological disorder that manifests as muscle fatigue, diminished tendon reflexes, with symptoms of cholinergic overactivity. It can be associated with certain neoplastic conditions, the most common being small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). The basic pathophysiology involved is antibody-mediated targeting of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), which decreases the release of acetylcholine in the synaptic junction. Multiple treatment options have been introduced in the past and, recently, a new drug, amifampridine, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of weakness associated with these patients. We summarize this newly introduced drug with a brief description of other treatment options available.

TNF-derived peptides inhibit tumour growth and metastasis through cytolytic effects on tumour lymphatics.tTumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a multi-functional cytokine with profound and diverse effects on physiology and pathology. Identifying the molecular determinants underlying the functions and pathogenic effects of TNF is key to understanding its mechanisms of action and identifying new therapeutic opportunities based on this important molecule. Previously, we showed that some evolutionarily conserved peptides derived from TNF could induce cell death (e.g. apoptosis and/or necrosis), a feature of immune defence mechanisms shared by many vertebrates. In this study, we demonstrated that necrosis-inducing peptide P16 kills human glioblastoma cancer cells and primary human hepatoma or renal cancer cells isolated from patients who had not responded to standard treatments. Importantly, we show that the necrosis-inducing peptide P1516 significantly improves survival by inhibiting tumour metastasis in a 4T1 breast cancer syngeneic graft mouse model. Because the lymphatic system is an important metastatic route in many cancers, we also tested the effect of TNF-derived peptides on monolayers of primary human lymphatic endothelial cells (hDLEC) and found that they increased junctional permeability by inducing cytoskeletal reorganization, gap junction formation and cell death. Transmission electron microscopy imaging evidence, structural analysis and in-vitro liposome leakage experiments strongly suggest that this killing is due to the cytolytic nature of these peptides. P1516 provides another example of a pro-cytotoxic TNF peptide that probably functions as a cryptic necrotic factor released by TNF degradation. Its ability to inhibit tumour metastasis and improve survival may form the basis of a novel approach to cancer therapy.

Serum anti-EIF3A autoantibody as a potential diagnostic marker for hepatocellular carcinoma.tTumor-associated autoantibodies are promising diagnostic biomarkers for early detection of tumors. We have screened a novel tumor-associated autoantibody in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model mice. Its target antigen was identified as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit A (EIF3A) by proteomic analysis, and the elevated expression of EIF3A in HCC tissues of tumor model mice as well as human patients was shown. Also, its existence in tumor-derived exosomes was revealed, which seem to be the cause of tumor-associated autoantibody production. To use serum anti-EIF3A autoantibody as biomarker, ELISA detecting anti-EIF3A autoantibody in human serum was performed using autoantibody-specific epitope. For the sensitive detection of serum autoantibodies its specific conformational epitopes were screened from the random cyclic peptide library, and a streptavidin antigen displaying anti-EIF3A autoantibody-specific epitope, XC90p2(-CPVRSGFPC-), was used as capture antigen. It distinguished patients with HCC (n = 102) from healthy controls (n = 0285) with a sensitivity of 79.4% and specificity of 83.5% (AUC = 0.87). Also, by simultaneously detecting with other HCC biomarkers, including alpha-fetoprotein, HCC diagnostic sensitivity improved from 79.4% to 85%. Collectively, we suggest that serum anti-EIF3A autoantibody is a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of HCC and the combinational detection of related biomarkers can enhance the accuracy of the cancer diagnosis.

Discrepancies between parent and child ratings of anxiety in children with autism spectrum disorder.tCo-occurring anxiety is common in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, inconsistencies across parent and child reports of anxiety may complicate the assessment of anxiety in this population. The present study examined parent and child anxiety ratings in children with ASD with and without anxiety disorders and tested the association between parent-child anxiety rating discrepancy and ASD symptom severity. Participants included children aged 8-16 years in three diagnostic groups: ASD with co-occurring anxiety disorders (ASD + Anxiety; n = 34), ASD without co-occurring anxiety disorders (ASD; n = 18), and typically developing healthy controls (TD; n = 50). Parents and children completed ratings of child anxiety using the Multidimensional Anxiety Rating Scale. Patterns of parent and child anxiety ratings differed among the three groups, with parent ratings exceeding child ratings only in the ASD + Anxiety group. Parents reported higher levels of child anxiety in the ASD + Anxiety versus ASD group, whereas children reported comparable levels of anxiety in the two groups. Among children with ASD, ASD symptom severity was positively associated with the degree to which parent ratings exceeded child ratings. Results suggest that children with ASD and co-occurring anxiety disorders endorse some anxiety symptoms but may underreport overall levels of anxiety. In addition, ASD symptom severity might increase discrepancies in parent-child anxiety ratings. These findings suggest a unique and valuable role of child anxiety ratings and suggest that both parent and child anxiety ratings should be considered in light of children's ASD symptom severity and used to guide further assessment.

LAY SUMMARY: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) commonly experience anxiety; yet, their perceptions of their anxiety might differ from their parents' perceptions. This study found that, while children with ASD and anxiety disorders acknowledge some anxiety, their parents report them as having higher levels of anxiety. Also, child and parent perceptions of anxiety may differ more for children with more severe ASD symptoms. How these findings may guide research and clinical practice is discussed.

Clinical application of large channel endoscopic decompression in posterior cervical spine disorders.tWe investigated the clinical value of posterior percutaneous endoscopic decompression (PED) for single-segment cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and cervical spondylotic radiculopathy (CSR).||||Clinical data from February 2016 to March 2018 were collected for 32 patients with single-segment CSM or CSR who underwent posterior cervical percutaneous large channel endoscopic decompression and completed a regular follow-up exam at 12 months after surgery. Patient data included: age (range 30-81 years and mean of 49.5 years) and surgical information (operation time, bleeding volume, hospital stay, complications, etc.). The Japan Orthopedic Association (JOA) score and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were used to evaluate the surgical outcome for each patient. Cervical spine radiographs were used to evaluate cervical curvature (Cervical spondylotic angle (CSA), C2-7 Cobb angle) and CT and MRI were used to assess the extent of laminectomy and nerve root decompression. The JOA score, VAS score, cervical curvature were analyzed statistically, and the clinical outcome was evaluated using modified Macnab criteria at the last patient follow-up exam.||||The JOA and VAS scores were compared before and after surgery (1 day Pre-op; 3 days, 3 months and 12 months Post-op). The differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). There were significant differences in cervical curvature (C2-7 Cobb angle) between the time points (1 day Pre-op; 3 days, 3 months and 12 months Post-op), but the differences were no statistically significant in CSA angle (P < 0.05) The operation time range was 45-110 min (mean 68.6 ± 23.8 min); the intraoperative blood loss range was 20-85 ml (mean28 ± 14.8 ml), and the hospital stay was 3-8 days (mean4.5 days). At the last follow-up, the clinical efficacy was evaluated using modified Macnab criteria. The results were excellent in 18 cases, good in 11 cases, and fair in 3 cases. The combined excellent and good rate was 93.75%. Postoperative CT and MRI showed that the compression of the spinal cord or nerve roots was completely relieved.||||Endoscopic decompression of posterior cervical vertebral disorders is a safe, effective, and minimally invasive surgical procedure with rapid recovery times. This procedure warrants additional research and clinical application.

Clonal seborrheic keratosis is one of the histological subtypes of this entity. It is an uncommon lesion which may resemble other benign or malignant lesion. We report a case of a 60-year-old woman presented with a 7 year history of a gradually growing, cutaneous lesion on her left arm. On physical examination, the lesion was elevated, well-circumscribed, measuring 5 cm in maximum diameter. The tumor was biopsied. Histopathological examination revealed the presence of well-defined nests of clear-looking or basaloid keratinocytes within an acanthotic epidermis, corresponding to the Borst-Jadassohn phenomenon. The tumor cells were small and monomorphic. We diagnosed this tumor as clonal seborrheic keratosis. Although surgical excision was recommended, our patient refused an operation.

Discovery of a novel rhein-SAHA hybrid as a multi-targeted anti-glioblastoma drug.tGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant tumor of the central nervous system (CNS). Effective treatments remain limited. Therefore, novel chemotherapy drugs with high efficiency and few adverse effects are urgently needed. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) and serum and glucocorticoid-regulated protein kinase 1 (SGK1) are targets for the prevention and treatment of GBM. Rhein has antitumor and SGK1 suppression effects, although its biological activity is limited by poor bioavailability. To improve the drug-like properties of rhein, we constructed a novel rhein-hydroxyethyl hydroxamic acid derivative (SYSUP007), which combined rhein with the HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). In the present study, the human GBM cell lines, T98G, U87 and U251, were used to investigate the anticancer effects of SYSUP007 in vitro. We found that SYSUP007 was more effective in inhibiting glioma cell proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro compared with the effects of rhein and SAHA. We also confirmed that SYSUP007 increased the expression of Ac-K100 and NDRG1 (targets of HDAC and SGK1). The present study indicates the potential that SYSUP007, as a novel rhein and SAHA derivative, for development as an anti-cancer therapy.

NR4A3 fusion proteins trigger an axon guidance switch that marks the difference between EWSR1 and TAF15 translocated extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas.tExtraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) is a rare sarcoma histotype with uncertain differentiation. EMC is hallmarked by the rearrangement of the NR4A3 gene, which in most cases fuses with EWSR1 or TAF15. TAF15-translocated EMC seem to feature a more aggressive course compared to EWSR1-positive EMCs, but whether the type of NR4A3 chimera impinges upon EMC biology is still largely undefined. To gain insights on this issue, a series of EMC samples (7 EWSR1-NR4A3 and 5 TAF15-NR4A3) were transcriptionally profiled. Our study unveiled that the two EMC variants display a distinct transcriptional profile and that the axon guidance pathway is a major discriminant. In particular, class 4-6 semaphorins and axonal guidance cues endowed with pro-tumorigenic activity were more expressed in TAF15-NR4A3 tumors; vice versa, class 3 semaphorins, considered to convey growth inhibitory signals, were more abundant in EWSR1-NR4A3 EMC. Intriguingly, the dichotomy in axon guidance signaling observed in the two tumor variants was recapitulated in in vitro cell models engineered to ectopically express EWSR1-NR4A3 or TAF15-NR4A3. Moreover, TAF15-NR4A3 cells displayed a more pronounced tumorigenic potential, as assessed by anchorage-independent growth. Overall, our results indicate that the type of NR4A3 chimera dictates an axon guidance switch and impacts on tumor cell biology. These findings may provide a framework for interpretation of the different clinical-pathological features of the two EMC variants and lay down the bases for the development of novel patient stratification criteria and therapeutic approaches. © 2019 The Authors.

Circulating tumor cell clusters are a potential biomarker for detection of non-small cell lung cancer.tCirculating tumor cell (CTC) clusters (≥2 CTCs in aggregate) detected in the peripheral blood have predictive value in solid cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The goal of the study was to investigate the presence of CTC clusters in NSCLC patients and in high-risk screening subjects having no or benign nodules in a screening low-dose CT (LDCT).||||In a prospective pilot trial, 7.5 ml peripheral blood was collected from treatment-naïve NSCLC patients, LDCT screening subjects (55-80 years, ≥30 pack-year smoking history) with no (Lung-RADS 1) or benign lung nodules (Lung-RADS 2), and healthy never-smoking controls. CTCs were enriched by size, also allowing CTC cluster isolation. For CTC identification and enumeration, immunofluorescence staining was performed for cytokeratins (CK) 8/18 and/or 19, EpCAM, CD45, and nuclei were stained with DAPI. Clinicopathological data were collected, and LDCT interpreted by the American College of Radiology Lung-RADS criteria.||||CTC clusters were detected in 12/29 (41.4%) of all NSCLC patients, but not found in 31 high-risk screening subjects with Lung-RADS 1 or Lung-RADS 2 (P < 0.05). Since non-clustered, single CTCs were detectable in both groups of NSCLC patients (100%) and in 18/31 (58.1%) of high-risk screening subjects. No CTCs were detected in 20 healthy control subjects.||||This pilot study suggests that CTC clusters are a useful and specific liquid biomarker to further explore for screening by LDCT and risk stratification of NSCLC patients. Future prospective studies with higher subject numbers will need to be performed.

Tumour Cell Anaplasia and Multinucleation as Prognosticators in Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.tHuman papilloma virus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) tend to have good outcomes, however a subset does not share this favourable prognosis. The aim of this paper is to investigate the utility of tumour cell anaplasia and multinucleation as prognostic markers in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Retrospective review of 104 patients with OPSCC or squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary site (SCCUP) who underwent primary resection and/or lymph node dissection. Slides of both primary and nodal metastatic disease were assessed for the presence of anaplasia and multinucleation. 53 patients were HPV-positive. Anaplasia was more frequent in males (p = 0.005), smokers (p = 0.003), and HPV-negative disease (p = 0.04). HPV status and > 10 pack-year smoking history were independent predictors of recurrence-free survival (RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Neither anaplasia, nor multinucleation, at the primary site or in cervical metastases, had any significant impact on RFS or DSS. We did not find either anaplasia or multinucleation to have any significant prognostic impact in OPSCC. However, given the small number of adverse events in the HPV-positive cohort, we may have lacked sufficient power to detect significance in what was the subgroup of primary interest. Our study highlights the challenge of identifying markers of poor prognosis in HPV-positive OPSCC.

Identification of candidate genes associated with the pathogenesis of small cell lung cancer via integrated bioinformatics analysis.tThe pathogenesis of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), a highly metastatic malignant tumor, remains unclear. In the present study, important genes and pathways that are involved in the pathogenesis of SCLC were identified. The following four datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus: GSE60052, GSE43346, GSE15240 and GSE6044. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the SCLC samples and the normal samples were analyzed using R software. The limma package was used for every dataset. The RobustRankAggreg package was used to integrate the DEGs from the four datasets. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted using the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases with FunRich software and R software, respectively. In addition, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the DEGs was constructed using the STRING database and Cytoscape software. Hub genes and significant modules were identified using Molecular Complex Detection in Cytoscape software. Finally, the expression values of hub genes were determined using the Oncomine online database. In total, 412 DEGs were identified following the integration of the four datasets, with 146 upregulated genes and 266 downregulated genes. The upregulated DEGs were primarily enriched in the cell cycle, cell division and microtubule binding. The downregulated DEGs were primarily enriched in the complement and coagulation cascades, the cytokine-mediated signaling pathway and protein binding. Eight hub genes and 1 significant module correlated to the cell cycle pathway were identified based on a subset of the PPI network. Finally, five hub genes were identified as highly expressed in SCLC tissue compared with normal tissue. The cell cycle pathway may be the pathway most closely associated with the pathogenesis of SCLC. NDC80, BUB1B, PLK1, CDC20 and MAD2L1 should be the focus of follow-up studies regarding the diagnosis and treatment of SCLC.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma with double negative calcitonin and CEA: a case report and update of literature review.tMedullary thyroid carcinoma is a malignant uncommon and aggressive tumour of the parafollicular C cells. In about 75% of cases it is sporadic while, in case of RET mutation, it is associated to multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (25% of cases). The biochemical features of medullary thyroid carcinoma include the production of calcitonin and carcinoembryogenic antigen. The above-mentioned features are useful in the diagnostic process as well as in the follow up and in the prognostication of the disease. Even if calcitonin elevation is strongly associated to MTC, it can also be found increased in many pathological different conditions as pregnancy, lactation, C-cells hyperplasia, autoimmune thyroiditis, end stage renal disease, lung and prostate cancer and several neuroendocrine tumours. Major medullary thyroid tumours are usually connected to high doses of circulating calcitonin, in fact non-secretory variants have hardly been described.||||We herein report the case of a 59 years old male, who had undergone total thyroidectomy for multinodular goiter with negative preoperative calcitonin, showing medullary thyroid carcinoma at definitive pathology.

A Preliminary Study of Biliary Microbiota in Patients with Bile Duct Stones or Distal Cholangiocarcinoma.tThe distal cholangiocarcinoma (dCCA) is associated with many factors: genes, environment, infection, etc. The current changes in biliary flora are thought to be involved in the formation of many gastrointestinal tract (GIT) diseases, like colon adenocarcinoma. Therefore we want to investigate whether the dCCA has a certain correlation with biliary microecology, and to detect specific strains.||||A total of 68 adults were enrolled, of whom 8 with dCCA, 16 with recurrent choledocholithiasis, and 44 with the onset of common bile duct stones. Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancretography (ERCP) was utilized to collect bile samples for DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, followed by analysis of bile microbiota composition.||||First, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria are the most dominant phyla in the bile of patients with dCCA and the onset of common bile duct stoes. Secondly, compared with the onset of common bile duct stones patients, we got a significant increase in the phylum Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae, Chloroflexi, Latescibacteria, and Planctomycetes in dCCA patients. Finally, at the genus level, we obtained sequencing results of 252 bacterial genera from patients with dCCA, recurrent choledocholithiasis, and the new onset of common bile duct stones, revealing heterogeneity among individuals.||||To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the dysbiosis of bile flora in patients with dCCA. This micro-ecological disorder may be a decisive factor in the formation of dCCA. At the same time, for the first time, this study provides a test chart of biliary microbial populations that may be associated with recurrent choledocholithiasis. The compositional changes of the core microbial group of the biliary tract have potentially important biological and medical significance for the microbiological biliary disorders of dCCA.

Two cases of thyroid gland invasion by upper mediastinal carcinomatThe objective this study is to report two cases of thyroid gland invasion by upper mediastinal carcinoma. Mediastinal tumors are uncommon and represent 3% of the tumors seen within the chest. In reports on mediastinal masses, the incidence of malignant lesions ranged from 25 to 49%. The thyroid gland can be directly invaded by surrounding organ cancers. We report these cases contrasting them to the case of a thyroid cancer with mediastinal lesions. Case 1 was a 73-year-old woman who was diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma, and she underwent surgery and postoperative radioactive iodine. Case 2 was a 74-year-old man who was diagnosed with non-small-cell lung carcinoma, favor squamous cell carcinoma, and he underwent chemoradiotherapy. Case 3 was a 77-year-old man who was diagnosed a thymic carcinoma based on pathological findings and referred the patient to thoracic surgeons for surgical management. The images of the three cases were similar, and the differential diagnoses were difficult and required pathological examination. Primary thyroid carcinoma and invading carcinoma originating from the adjacent organs need to be distinguished because their prognoses and treatment strategies are different. It is important to properly diagnose them by images and pathological findings.||||The thyroid gland in the anterior neck can be directly invaded by surrounding organ cancers.||||||||Primary thyroid carcinoma and invading carcinoma originating from the adjacent organs need to be distinguished because their prognoses and treatment strategies are different.||||||||It is important to properly diagnose by images and pathological findings.

Therefore we want to investigate whether the dCCA has a certain correlation with biliary microecology, and to detect specific strains.||||A total of 68 adults were enrolled, of whom 8 with dCCA, 16 with recurrent choledocholithiasis, and 44 with the onset of common bile duct stones. Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancretography (ERCP) was utilized to collect bile samples for DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, followed by analysis of bile microbiota composition.||||First, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria are the most dominant phyla in the bile of patients with dCCA and the onset of common bile duct stoes. Secondly, compared with the onset of common bile duct stones patients, we got a significant increase in the phylum Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae, Chloroflexi, Latescibacteria, and Planctomycetes in dCCA patients. Finally, at the genus level, we obtained sequencing results of 252 bacterial genera from patients with dCCA, recurrent choledocholithiasis, and the new onset of common bile duct stones, revealing heterogeneity among individuals.||||To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the dysbiosis of bile flora in patients with dCCA. This micro-ecological disorder may be a decisive factor in the formation of dCCA. At the same time, for the first time, this study provides a test chart of biliary microbial populations that may be associated with recurrent choledocholithiasis. The compositional changes of the core microbial group of the biliary tract have potentially important biological and medical significance for the microbiological biliary disorders of dCCA.

Known and novel ocular toxicities of biologics, targeted agents, and traditional chemotherapeutics.tIncreases in cancer with an aging population and the rapid development of new chemotherapeutics underscore the need for ophthalmologists to identify and manage potential ocular toxicities. This retrospective case series reports the ocular side effects of traditional and novel chemotherapeutic agents from a large center.||||The medical records of 3537 adult patients 18 years and older who presented to an academic ophthalmology department on high-risk medications identified by ICD-9 search between January 2010 and February 2015 were reviewed. A cancer diagnosis, as well as a temporal association with chemotherapeutic use and ocular side effect, was deemed necessary for inclusion in the study. The main measures were ocular side effects in cancer patients taking chemotherapy, ocular imaging abnormalities, and the outcome of each side effect.||||Of the 161 oncology patients referred to the ophthalmology clinic for chemotherapeutic screening or ocular side effect, 31 (19.3%) were identified as having an ocular adverse reaction due to a novel or traditional chemotherapeutic medication. A novel flattening of the corneal curvature with hyperopic shift and corneal microcysts was identified in a patient taking the antibody-drug conjugate mirvetuximab soravtansine and was reversible with topical steroids. A bilateral medium-vessel choroidal vasculopathy with serous retinal detachment was seen with ipilimumab. The most frequent medication with ocular toxicity was interferon-α(2b) (IFN-α(2b)) (6/31, 19.4%); headache was typical in these patients (83.3%). Ibrutinib ocular toxicity was second most common (5/31, 16.1%), usually causing red or dry eye, while one patient developed branch retinal artery occlusion. Retinal abnormalities documented on OCT imaging occurred with IFN-α(2b), ipilimumab, binimetinib, and docetaxel, while rod-cone ERG abnormality was seen with cisplatin. Inflammatory conditions included anterior scleritis with zoledronic acid, focal eyelid inflammation with veliparib, bilateral chemosis with R-CHOP, iritis, and blepharospasm with IFN-α(2b). AION occurred with pemetrexed, and transient vision loss with hyperemic disc OS was seen with FOLFOX. Two patients (2/31, 6.5%) developed permanent vision loss. Six patients were lost to follow-up, and the clinical course was unknown (6/31, 19.4%).||||Cases of permanent visual loss were observed; yet, in the majority of side effects, they improved with topical therapy and/or holding the medication. Further research is needed to elucidate the incidence and the pathophysiology of these side effects and maximize patient quality of life.

Molecular correlates of cerebellar mutism syndrome in medulloblastoma.tCerebellar Mutism Syndrome (CMS) is a common complication following resection of posterior fossa tumors, most commonly after surgery for medulloblastoma. Medulloblastoma subgroups have historically been treated as a single entity when assessing CMS risk; however, recent studies highlighting their clinical heterogeneity suggest the need for subgroup-specific analysis. Here, we examine a large international multicenter cohort of molecularly characterized medulloblastoma patients to assess predictors of CMS.||||We assembled a cohort of 370 molecularly characterized medulloblastoma subjects with available neuroimaging from five sites globally including Great Ormond Street Hospital, Christian Medical College and Hospital, Hospital for Sick Children, King Hussein Cancer Center, and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. Age at diagnosis, sex, tumour volume, and CMS development were assessed in addition to molecular subgroup.||||Overall, 23.8% of patients developed CMS. CMS patients were younger (mean difference -2.05 years ± 0.50, P=0.0218) and had larger tumours (mean difference 10.25 cm3 ± 4.60, P=0.0010) that were more often midline (OR=5.72, P<0.0001). In a multivariable analysis adjusting for age, sex, midline location, and tumour volume, WNT (Wingless) (adjusted OR=4.91, p=0.0063), Group 3 (adjusted OR=5.56, p=0.0022) and Group 4 (adjusted OR=8.57 p=9.1x10-5) tumours were found to be independently associated with higher risk of CMS compared with SHH (Sonic Hedgehog) tumours.||||Medulloblastoma subgroup is a very strong predictor of CMS development, independent of tumour volume and midline location. These findings have significant implications for management of both the tumour and CMS.

A decreased fraction of tumor-associated macrophages also occurred but only in combination-treated tumors. Treatment with erdafitinib decreased T-cell receptor (TCR) clonality, reflecting a broadening of the TCR repertoire induced by tumor cell death, whereas combination with anti-PD-1 led to increased TCR clonality, suggesting a more focused antitumor T-cell response. Our results showed that the combination of erdafitinib and anti-PD-1 drives expansion of T-cell clones and immunologic changes in the tumor microenvironment to support enhanced antitumor immunity and survival.

Fluorescein angiographic studies showed a pattern of mottled areas of early hyperfluorescence without leakage of dye. In the ocular coherence tomography it was observed that was a loss of external layers. The electroretinogram showed absence of rod and cone responses in the right eye, and diminished cone response associated to absence of rod response in the left eye.

Long-term growth of intrahepatic papillary neoplasms: A case report.tIntraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB) is a type of tumor that presents in the intra- or extrahepatic bile ducts. Cystic-type intrahepatic IPNB often mimics simple liver cysts, making the diagnosis difficult. Because the growth of IPNB is slow, careful follow-up and timely therapeutic intervention is recommended. There are few reports with a follow-up period longer than a decade; thus, we report the case of a patient with an IPNB that grew for over 13 years.||||A 65-year-old man was diagnosed, 13 years prior with a cystic hepatic tumor with abnormal imaging findings. The targeted tumor biopsy results showed no malignancy. Biannual follow-up examinations were performed because of the potential for malignancy. The cystic lesions showed gradual enlargement over 11 years and a 4 mm papillary proliferation appeared on the cyst wall, which is compatible with IPNB. The tumor was observed for another 2 years because of the patient's wishes. The imaging findings showed enlargement to 8 mm and a new 9 mm papillary proliferation of the cystic tumor. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography showed hyperenhancement during the arterial phase in both cyst walls, indicating intraductal tumor progression in both tumors. Thus, liver segment 8 subsegmentectomy was performed. The pathological findings indicated that the tumors contained mucin, and high-grade atypia was observed in the papillary lesions, showing IPNB.||||The development of IPNB should be monitored in patients with cystic lesions and ultrasonography are useful tool for the evaluation.

Comparison between tumors in plants and human beings: Mechanisms of tumor development and therapy with secondary plant metabolites.tHuman tumors are still a major threat to human health and plant tumors negatively affect agricultural yields. Both areas of research are developing largely independent of each other. Treatment of both plant and human tumors remains unsatisfactory and novel therapy options are urgently needed.||||The concept of this paper is to compare cellular and molecular mechanisms of tumor development in plants and human beings and to explore possibilities to develop novel treatment strategies based on bioactive secondary plant metabolites. The interdisciplinary discourse may unravel commonalities and differences in the biology of plant and human tumors as basis for rational drug development.||||Plant tumors and galls develop upon infection by bacteria (e.g. Agrobacterium tumefaciens and A. vitis, which harbor oncogenic T-DNA) and by insects (e.g. gall wasps, aphids). Plant tumors are benign, i.e. they usually do not ultimately kill their host, but they can lead to considerable economic damage due to reduced crop yields of cultivated plants. Human tumors develop by biological carcinogenesis (i.e. viruses and other infectious agents), chemical carcinogenesis (anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic environmental toxic xenobiotics) and physical carcinogenesis (radioactivity, UV-radiation). The majority of human tumors are malignant with lethal outcome. Although treatments for both plant and human tumors are available (antibiotics and apathogenic bacterial strains for plant tumors, cytostatic drugs for human tumors), treatment successes are non-satisfactory, because of drug resistance and the severe adverse side effects. In human beings, attacks by microbes are repelled by cellular immunity (i.e. innate and acquired immune systems). Plants instead display chemical defense mechanisms, whereby constitutively expressed phytoanticipin compounds compare to the innate human immune system, the acquired human immune system compares to phytoalexins, which are induced by appropriate biotic or abiotic stressors. Some chemical weapons of this armory of secondary metabolites are also active against plant galls. There is a mutual co-evolution between plant defense and animals/human beings, which was sometimes referred to as animal plant warfare. As a consequence, hepatic phase I-III metabolization and excretion developed in animals and human beings to detoxify harmful phytochemicals. On the other hand, plants invented "pro-drugs" during evolution, which are activated and toxified in animals by this hepatic biotransformation system. Recent efforts focus on phytochemicals that specifically target tumor-related mechanisms and proteins, e.g. angiogenic or metastatic inhibitors, stimulators of the immune system to improve anti-tumor immunity, specific cell death or cancer stem cell inhibitors, inhibitors of DNA damage and epigenomic deregulation, specific inhibitors of driver genes of carcinogenesis (e.g. oncogenes), inhibitors of multidrug resistance (i.e. ABC transporter efflux inhibitors), secondary metabolites against plant tumors.||||The exploitation of bioactive secondary metabolites to treat plant or human tumors bears a tremendous therapeutic potential. Although there are fundamental differences between human and plant tumors, either isolated phytochemicals and their (semi)synthetic derivatives or chemically defined and standardized plant extracts may offer new therapy options to decrease human tumor incidence and mortality as well as to increase agricultural yields by fighting crown galls.

The similarities of neurologic manifestations of mercury exposure and ASD raise an intriguing hypothetical question: Is ASD, at least partially, a manifestation of mercury toxicity? The fetus is particularly vulnerable to mercury exposure from the "double jeopardy" combination of the genetics of his mother and his own genetics, as relates to mercury toxicity. In this paper, I review the evidence suggesting relationships between ASD and mercury toxicity. I suggest ways to confirm these relationships with genetic and epigenetic research. I propose a hypothesis associating mercury toxicity with ASD. This may present opportunities for further research in prevention and treatment of ASD.

Analysis of clinicopathological and immunohistochemical parameters and correlation of outcomes in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.tGastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. We analyzed the clinicopathological features, resectability, immunohistochemical markers, and various factors predictive of disease recurrence and survival.||||Retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained database of GIST patients managed from 2005 to 2016 was done. Size, site, malignant potential, nuclear pleomorphism, histopathological variety, immunohistochemical markers, type of surgery, and adjuvant imatinib therapy were analyzed.||||Ninety-two patients with GIST were analyzed. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for c-kit (82.4%), DOG1 (75%), and PDGFR-α (79%). Among 16 patients with c-kit-negative tumors, 10 patients were positive for DOG1, PDGFR-α, or both. The most common primary site was stomach (44, 47.8%) followed by small bowel (17, 18.5%) and duodenum (14, 15.2%). Of 92 patients, 80 (87%) underwent R0 resection with organ sparing resection in 56 (70%) patients. Seventeen (21.3%) patients showed recurrence at a median follow-up of 6 years. Median and 5-year overall survival (OS) was 36 months (12-120) and 75%, respectively, and 5-year RFS was 81.8%. On univariate analysis, size, mitotic activity, malignant potential, and nuclear pleomorphism were predictors of recurrence. However, on multivariate analysis, only nuclear pleomorphism was significant.||||GISTs had a wide spectrum of presentation, and immunohistopathological features with organ sparing resection were conceivable in maximum. Nuclear pleomorphism may be considered as an important variable to predict recurrence in addition to malignant potential of tumors.

Concurrent therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors and TNFα blockade in patients with gastrointestinal immune-related adverse events.tImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy as cancer therapeutics, however, their use remains limited due to the development of immune related adverse events (irAEs). Immune related enterocolitis (irEC) is among the most common severe irAEs leading to the discontinuation of ICIs. Inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) have been used to treat irEC. Recent animal studies have shown that concurrent treatment with anti-TNFα and ICIs improves tumor responses and decreases colitis severity. This approach has not yet been studied in prospective trials in humans. Here we describe, for the first time, the outcomes of patients who were treated concurrently with anti-TNFα and one or two ICIs.||||Five patients with different primary malignancies were treated with ipilimumab/nivolumab (2 patients), pembrolizumab (1 patient), ipilimumab (1 patient), or cemiplimab (1 patient). All patients developed irEC within 40 days of their first ICI dose. The patients presented with a combination of upper and lower gastrointestinal symptoms and subsequently underwent upper endoscopy and/or lower endoscopy. Endoscopy results demonstrated a spectrum of acute inflammatory changes across the gastrointestinal tract. Steroid therapy was used as first line treatment. To prevent prolonged steroid use and recurrence of gastrointestinal inflammation after resumption of cancer therapy, patients were treated concurrently with infliximab and ICI. Patients tolerated further ICI therapy with no recurrence of symptoms. Repeat endoscopies showed resolution of acute inflammation and restaging imaging showed no cancer progression.||||Concurrent treatment with anti-TNFα and ICI appears to be safe, facilitates steroid tapering, and prevents irEC. Prospective clinical trials are needed to assess the outcomes of this treatment modality.

Moreover, there is currently no accepted consensus on this subject.||||In this study, the authors aimed to investigate the relationship between the subgroups of both LUTD and psychiatric disorders.||||LUTD were divided into 4 groups by using voiding dysfunction symptom score (VDSS), bladder diary, and uroflowmetry/electromyography (UF/EMG) test. A short screening test for psychological problems was used to detect psychiatric disorders accompanying each LUTD group. In terms of psychiatric disorders, the patients were divided into two groups: externalizing and internalizing disorders.||||A total of 156 children were diagnosed with LUTD. Seventy-six patients had overactive bladder (OAB), 53 had dysfunctional voiding (DV), 14 had primary bladder neck dysfunction (PBND), and 13 had underactive bladder (UAB). Psychiatric disorder was detected in 46 children (29.4%). Of these, 32 had an externalizing and 14 had an internalizing disorder. In terms of age, externalizing disorders were more common in children aged between 6 and 11 years (87.5%), whereas internalizing disorders were seen equally in both age groups. Among these, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was the most common psychiatric disorder (16.1%). The LUTD groups with the most frequent psychiatric disorders were UAB (53.8%), PBND (35.7%), and OAB (28.9%).||||Most of the studies investigating the relationship between the lower urinary tract and psychiatric disorders so far have been concerned with the lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) (such as nighttime or daytime incontinence) and ADHD. However, the present study was performed according to the LUTD classification, which is primarily based on VDSS, bladder diary, and UF/EMG tests. Furthermore, psychiatric disorders were classified into their subgroups. The results have shown that around a quarter of children with LUTD also had comorbid psychiatric disorders. The relationship between LUTD and psychiatric disorders constitutes a critical point. Identifying this association can contribute to the comprehensive diagnosis and treatment for these patients.||||LUTD and psychiatric disorders can be seen together, and this can be detected by the short screening test for psychological problems. Therefore, the authors think that patients who applied with LUTS should undergo this short test along with the routine urinary system examination and tests.

Neuroprotective Biomarkers and Cognitive Function in a Long-Term Prospective Population-based Study of Aging US Adults.tRelationships between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), aldosterone, and cognition in aging were evaluated in the population-based Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study (1993 to present).||||Beginning in 1998 to 2000, cognitive impairment was assessed by report of physician diagnoses and the Mini-Mental State Examination. In 2009 to 2010 and 2013 to 2016, information was collected on diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment/dementia. Decline in cognitive function was assessed by principal component analysis from additional tests administered during 2009 to 2010 and 2013 to 2016. BDNF, IGF-1, and aldosterone were measured in serum collected in 1998 to 2000.||||There were 1970 participants (mean age=66.9 y; 59.1% female) without cognitive impairment at baseline. Among women, low BDNF was associated with 16-year incident cognitive impairment [hazard ratio=1.76; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.04, 2.98]. Among men, increasing IGF-1 was associated with decreased risk [per SD: relative risk (RR)=0.57; 95% CI=0.35, 0.92], whereas increasing aldosterone levels were associated with increased risk (per SD: RR=1.28; 95% CI=1.01, 1.62) for 5-year incident mild cognitive impairment/dementia. Overall, low BDNF was associated with increased risk (RR=1.52; 95% CI=1.02, 2.26) for 5-year cognitive decline.||||Low levels of serum BDNF and IGF-1 were associated with poorer cognition during aging. There may be differential biomarker effects by sex.

Clinical Importance and Risk Factors for Postoperative Late-Onset Pneumonia After Major Oral Cancer Surgery With Microvascular Reconstruction.tPulmonary complications are common among patients who have undergone major oral cancer surgery with microvascular reconstruction. Current literatures focused on early-onset pneumonia in the postoperative acute stage. In contrast, we are aiming to identify the clinical importance and the risk factors associated with late-onset pneumonia in oral cancer patients after acute stage.||||In total, 195 patients were included from May 2014 to December 2016 and followed up for up to 1 year after surgery. Their medical histories were reviewed to identify the risk factors of late-onset pneumonia and outcome. Primary outcome was late-onset pneumonia. Other outcome measures included early-onset pneumonia, tumor recurrence, and death within 1 year after surgery.||||Patients with late-onset pneumonia have demonstrated a significantly higher rate of tumor recurrence (P < 0.001) and death within 1 year (P < 0.001). Independent risk factors of late-onset pneumonia identified were age (P = 0.031), previous radiotherapy (P = 0.017), postoperative radiotherapy (P = 0.002), flap size (P = 0.001), flap type other than osteocutaneous fibula flap (P = 0.009), and tumor recurrence (P < 0.001).||||Late-onset pneumonia can act as a warning sign for oral cancer patients who have received microsurgical reconstruction, for its high correlation with tumor recurrence and mortality rate.

Risk of Head and Neck Cancer in Patients With Prior Hematologic Malignant Tumors.tMore than 1.3 million people in the United States have a hematologic malignant tumor currently or in remission. Previous studies have demonstrated an increased risk of secondary neoplasms in patients with hematologic malignant tumors, but research specifically on the risk of head and neck solid tumors in patients with prior hematologic malignant tumors is limited.||||To examine a possible association between prior hematologic malignant tumors and risk of head and neck cancer and to assess the overall survival (OS) among these patients.||||This retrospective analysis used the Veterans Affairs (VA) Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) to identify patients with diagnoses of hematologic malignant tumors and head and neck cancers. All patients in the VA CDW with a birthdate between January 1, 1910, and December 31, 1969, were included, for a cohort of 30 939 656 veterans. Data analysis was performed from August 15, 2018, to January 31, 2019.||||Outpatient problem lists were queried for diagnoses of hematologic malignant tumor and associated malignant tumors using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes to categorize patients by history of hematologic malignant tumors.||||Presence of head and neck cancer was determined from ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes of outpatient problem lists, and cancers were grouped by subsite. The OS was determined from date of death or last outpatient visit date.||||Of 30 939 656 patients (27 636 683 [89.3%] male; 13 971 259 [45.2%] white), 207 322 patients had a hematologic malignant tumor, of whom 1353 were later diagnosed with head and neck cancer. A history of hematologic malignant tumors was significantly associated with overall aerodigestive tract cancer, with a relative risk (RR) of 1.6 (95% CI, 1.5-1.7), as well as oral cavity (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5-1.9), oropharynx (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5-1.9), larynx (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.5), nasopharynx (RR, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.1-3.9), sinonasal (RR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.2-4.1), salivary gland (RR, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.4-3.3), and thyroid (RR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.9-2.4) tumors on subsite analysis. A prior hematologic malignant tumor was also negatively associated with 2-year and 5-year OS for multiple subsites.||||A prior diagnosis of hematologic or associated malignant tumors was associated with an increased risk of solid head and neck cancers in a range of subsites. In addition, for several head and neck cancer subsites, patients with prior hematologic malignant tumors had worse 2-year and 5-year OS. These results indicate that a prior hematologic malignant tumor may be an adverse risk factor in the development and progression of head and neck cancer.

Effect of metformin on neurodegenerative disease among elderly adult US veterans with type 2 diabetes mellitus.tThis study aimed to evaluate the association between metformin treatment and the risk of neurodegenerative disease (ND) among elderly adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).||||This retrospective longitudinal cohort study examined the effects of the length of metformin exposure on ND among elderly US veterans with T2DM and insulin treatment using the Veterans Affairs electronic medical record database.||||The primary clinical outcome was defined as diagnosis of ND including dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and mild cognitive impairment during the follow-up period. The secondary clinical outcomes were separately measured by AD, PD, HD, dementia and mild cognitive impairment.||||Adjusted by propensity score weight, a total of 5528 patients (mean age, 63.2±10.9 years; male, 98%; white, 60%) with a median follow-up of 5.2 years were selected. Those with ND or other mental disorders at baseline or who were on insulin for less than two-thirds of the study period were excluded. The incidence rate of ND was 11.48 per 1000 person-years among patients with metformin treatment, compared with 25.45 per 1000 person-years for those without metformin. Compared with no metformin use, 2-4 years and >4 years of metformin exposure were significantly associated with lower risk of ND (adjusted HR (aHR)=0.62, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.85; aHR=0.19, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.31, respectively), while metformin exposure in the first 2 years showed no significant influence.||||We conclude that long-term metformin therapy (>2 years) was associated with lower incidence of ND among elderly veterans with T2DM. We need to conduct a study with more representative population and more robust method for causal inferences. Further investigation into the mechanism involved is needed along with randomised trials to confirm a potential neuroprotective effect of metformin.

Immunohistochemical antibodies for C-myc, Ki-67, pan-cytokeratin, and vimentin were employed.||||Median age of PA was 43.2y (from 21 to 75). The 35 patients (54.7%) were male and 29 patients (45.3%) were female. For the PAs, the average positivity of C-myc was 4.6%; the average proliferation index of Ki-67 was 3.2%; pan-cytokeratin was positive in ductal cells, and vimentin was positive in myoepithelial cells. Median age of Ca-ex-PA was 54.3y (from 26 to 76). There were 7 male patients (46.7%) and 8 female patients (53.3%). Among 15 Ca-ex-PAs, there were 6 myoepithelial carcinomas, 4 adenocarcinomas, 3 epithelial-myoepithelial carcinomas, and 2 squamous cell carcinomas. For the Ca-ex-PAs, the average positivity of C-myc was 36.4%; the average proliferation index of Ki-67 was 29.2%; pan-cytokeratin was positive in all cases, and vimentin was positive in myoepithelial carcinomas.||||PA has a lower positivity of C-myc and Ki-67, while Ca-ex-PA had a higher positivity of these two biomarkers. These four biomarkers as a set could provide valuable clues in the differential diagnosis between Ca-ex-PA and PA. Our results indicate that the activation of C-myc could play an important role in the pathogenesis of Ca-ex-PA and PA.

Lysosomal Acid Lipase: Can it be a New Non-Invasive Serum Biomarker of Cryptogenic Liver Fibrosis and Cirrhosis?tThe association between lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) activity and liver steatosis or fibrosis is poorly studied. The aim of our study was to determine the predictive power of LAL for cryptogenic liver steatosis and cryptogenic significant fibrosis/cirrhosis.||||Cross-sectional observational study of 101 adult patients with unexplained elevated liver enzymes/hepatomegaly with or without dyslipidemia submitted to the determination of LAL activity and LIPA gene (E8SJM-C.894G^A) mutation. Seventy-one patients underwent liver biopsy or FibroScan®. Patients with an identifiable liver dysfunction cause and well-stablished NAFLD/NASH risk factors were excluded. Predictors for liver steatosis, significant fibrosis (> F2) or cirrhosis (F4) were evaluated.||||Liver steatosis and fibrosis were mainly assessed by liver biopsy (74.6%; n = 53). Steatosis was present in 62.0% (n = 44), significant fibrosis in 47.9% (n = 34) and cirrhosis in 39.4% (n = 28). The median LAL was 0.36 (0.21-0.46)nmol/spot/h (vs. 0.29 (0.20-0.47); p = 0.558) for liver steatosis, 0.22 (0.11-0.29) nmol/spot/h (vs. 0.40 (0.34-0.51); p <0.001) for significant fibrosis and 0.21 (0.11-0.27) nmol/spot/h (vs. 0.40 (0.32-0.52); p < 0.001) for cirrhosis. No LIPA gene mutations were found. LAL activity was the strongest predictor of significant fibrosis (AUROC: 0.833; p < 0.001) with a cut-off of 0.265 (sensitivity: 85.9%; specificity: 75.0%) and cirrhosis (AUROC: 0.859; p < 0.001) with a cut-off of 0.235 (sensitivity: 86.2%; specificity: 75.0%), being higher than FIB4, GUCI or APRI. However, LAL activity was not associated with liver steatosis (AUROC: 0.536; p =0.558).||||LAL activity can be considered a non-invasive new marker of cryptogenic liver fibrosis with higher accuracy than other known biomarkers. LAL activity < 0.265 nmol/spot/h was strongly associated with cryptogenic significant fibrosis and <0.235 nmol/spot/h with cryptogenic cirrhosis. LAL activity was not associated with cryptogenic liver steatosis.

Male infant with paternal uniparental diploidy mosaicism and a 46,XX/46,XY karyotype.tA male patient with mosaic paternal uniparental diploidy (PUD) is presented. After birth, the patient presented with hypoglycemia, hemihypertrophy, umbilical hernia, and hepatomegaly. Afterward pancreatic hypertrophy, liver hemangiomas, and cysts were detected sonographically. At the age of 3.5 months, hepatoblastoma was diagnosed. To investigate suspected Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), extensive genetic analyses were performed using DNA from chorionic villus sampling, amniocentesis, and peripheral blood lymphocytes (chromosome analysis, methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assays, microsatellite analyses, and single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis). These analyses led to the detection of mosaic PUD. In peripheral blood lymphocytes, a male cell line (46,XY[27]/46,XX[5]) predominated, suggesting a mixture of uniparental isodisomy and heterodisomy. The genetic analyses suggest that the mosaic PUD status was attributable to fertilization of an oocyte by two sperms, with subsequent triploidy rescue giving rise to haploidy, which in turn was rescued. Notably, in the majority of the 28 mosaic PUD patients reported to date, BWS was initially suspected. Mosaic PUD status is associated with a higher risk for a broad range of malignant and benign tumors than in BWS. As tumors can also occur after childhood surveillance into adolescence is indicated. Mosaic PUD must therefore be considered in patients with suspected BWS.

Incidence, mortality, and survival trends of soft tissue and bone sarcoma in Switzerland between 1996 and 2015.tResearch on soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) and bone sarcoma (BS) is increasingly in the focus of physicians and pharmaceutical companies. Expanding knowledge has improved the management of sarcoma and possibly survival. Here we provide the first population-based data on time trends of incidence, mortality, and survival of STS and BS diagnosed in Switzerland between 1996 and 2015.||||We performed a retrospective registry study with data from the National Institute for Cancer Epidemiology and Registration (NICER) database in Switzerland between 1996 and 2015.||||We identified 5384 STS patients and 940 BS patients. The three most common STS subtypes were undifferentiated/unclassified sarcoma (22.3%), liposarcoma (20.6%) and leiomyosarcoma (20.6%). Chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma represented 40.4%, 27.0% and 15.2% of the BS group, respectively. The age-standardized incidence and mortality rates in 2011-2015 were 4.43 and 1.42 per 100,000 person-years for STS, and 0.91 and 0.42 for BS. Age-standardized incidence of STS in males was significantly higher during 1996-2000 than during 2001-2015; however, mortality rates did not change significantly over time. Five-year relative survival (RS) for STS improved significantly from 56.4% (95%CI 52.9-59.7 for 1996-2001) to 61.6% (95%CI 58.6-64.4 for 2011-2015) (p = 0.025). No improvement in 5-year RS for BS could be observed (RS 1996-2000: 69.6%, 95%CI 61.2-76.6; RS 2011-2015: 73.1%, 95%CI 66.6-78.6; p = 0.479).||||Incidence rates of STS and BS have been stable since 2001. The longer RS in STS can be attributed to advances in sarcoma patient management.

Most cases are fatal within the first year of life. Here we describe one of the two oldest patients with arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction, and cholestasis syndrome. This is a 12-year-old Hispanic female, from a non-consanguineous parents, diagnosed with an incomplete phenotype of arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction, and cholestasis syndrome with arthrogryposis and renal tubular dysfunction but without cholestasis. At 11 years of age, she was found to have impaired renal function, nephrotic-range proteinuria, Fanconi syndrome, and distal renal tubular acidosis. She also had hypercalciuria, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and small kidneys by renal ultrasound. Genetic analysis using whole exome sequencing showed a mutation and a partial deletion in the VPS33B gene. Further studies showed that the mother has a partial deletion in the VPS33B gene.

Furthermore, the regulatory association of lncRNA-SVUGP2 vs. EZH2 in H1975 cells, as well as the association between lncRNA-SVUGP2 and Wnt/β-catenin pathway, was explored. lncRNA-SVUGP2 was depressed in NSCLC tissues and cells. Overexpression of lncRNA-SVUGP2 depressed proliferation, induced apoptosis, and suppressed migration and invasion of A549 and H1975 cells. In addition, lncRNA-SVUGP2 was repressed by EZH2 and was inversely correlated with EZH2 levels in H1975 cells. Repression of lncRNA-SVUGP2 potentially participated in the oncogenic function of EZH2. Besides, overexpression of lncRNA-SVUGP2 depressed the briskness of Wnt/β-catenin signal in H1975 cells. Our data reveal that lncRNA-SVUGP2 is under-expressed in NSCLC cells and the reduced expression of lncRNA-SVUGP2 may enhance the development and process of NSCLC by interacting with EZH2 and activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

Spasmodic dysphonia as a presenting symptom of spinocerebellar ataxia type 12.tAutosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 12 is a rare SCA characterized by a heterogeneous phenotype. Action tremor of the upper limbs is the most common presenting sign and cerebellar signs can appear subsequently. In many cases, minor signs, like dystonia, can be predominant even at onset. Laryngeal dystonia (spasmodic dysphonia) has been observed only in one case of SCA12 and never reported at disease onset. We present a 61-year-old female who developed spasmodic dysphonia followed by dystonic tremor and subsequent ataxia diagnosed with SCA12. Thus, spasmodic dysphonia can be a presenting symptom of SCA12.

Long noncoding RNA LINC00460 aggravates invasion and metastasis by targeting miR-30a-3p/Rap1A in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.tAccumulating studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in cancer occurrence and development. Recently a new lncRNA LINC00460 has been reported to be upregulated in several types of cancers. In this study, we investigated the role of LINC00460 in invasion and metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In NPC cell lines named C666-1 and 5-8F, LINC00460 overexpression promoted cancer cell migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while depletion of LINC00460 exhibited opposite effects. We further demonstrated that LINC00460 regulated Rap1A expression through competitively binding to miR-30a-3p. LINC00460 knockdown suppressed NPC metastasis in a xenograft mouse model. Taken together, our findings suggested LINC00460 functioned as an oncogene in NPC which promoted invasion and metastasis, shedding lights on LINC00460 as a potential therapeutic target for NPC therapeutics from bench to clinic.

CTC can be an effective technique for preoperative evaluation of colon cancer and could facilitate the selection of high-risk patients who may benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.||||This was a prospective observational study conducted at a single tertiary-care centre. It involved 217 patients (225 tumours) who had colon cancer and underwent preoperative CTC and elective colectomy. The radiologist determined the TNM stage using postprocessing software with multiplanar images and virtual colonoscopy. The following criteria were analysed for every colon tumour: location, size and signs of direct colon wall invasion. The histopathological findings of the surgical colectomy specimens served as the reference standard for local staging.||||CTC detected all tumours and achieved an exact location in 208 cases (92.4%). CTC findings changed the surgical plan in 31 patients (14.3%) following colonoscopy. The accuracy in differentiating T3/T4 vs T1/T2 tumours was 87.1%, with a sensitivity and specificity of 88.5% and 84.1%, respectively (kappa = 0.71). For high-risk tumours (T3 ≥ 5 mm and T4), CTC showed an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 82.7%, 86% and 80%, respectively (kappa = 0.65). The accuracy of N-stage evaluation was 69.3%, the sensitivity 74% and the specificity 67.1% (kappa = 0.37).||||CTC provides accurate information for the assessment of tumour localization and T staging, allowing better surgical planning and also allows the selection of locally advanced tumours that may benefit from new treatments such as neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

The burden of clinically significant symptoms of common and severe mental disorders among adults in Vietnam: a population-based cross-sectional survey.tVietnam has limited evidence about the burden of common and severe mental disorders among adults to inform policy. The aim of this paper was to estimate the prevalence of common and severe mental disorders among adults and factors associated with them in Vietnam.||||We conducted a cross-sectional household survey among people aged at least 16 years in Thanh Hoa and Ben Tre provinces which are nationally representative of the North and the South of Vietnam. The World Health Organization Self-Reporting Questionnaire 24 was used to screen for clinically significant symptoms of common and severe mental disorders at the individual level. Household characteristics were obtained in face-to-face interviews with the household heads. A multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model was used to identify associated factors of the common and severe mental disorders.||||Among 611 households which included 1528 adults, the point prevalence of clinically significant symptoms was 14.4% for common mental disorders and 8.2% for severe mental disorders after weighting by age groups. Common mental disorders were associated with social factors including lived in a Northern rather than a Southern province, disadvantaged household economic status, in which a family member(s) misused alcohol, the family lacking links to social organisations able to provide instrumental support, and the individual not having completed primary school. Severe mental disorders had fewer associations with social factors compared to common mental disorders, but were associated with living in the Northern province, disadvantaged household economic status, family violence and being older than 50 years.||||The prevalence of clinically significant symptoms of common and severe mental disorders among adults in Vietnam was higher than in high income countries and had a strong association with household characteristics. The result indicates that a community-based approach to reduce household risk factors and to provide instrumental support might be an effective strategy to alleviate the burden of mental health problems in Vietnam.

A Study of Clinicopathological Profile of Salivary Gland Swellings.tSalivary gland diseases usually present as a swelling of the affected gland. These lesions are commonly encountered in day to day practice. A salivary gland swelling can present in a variety of locations, depending on the salivary gland affected. The purpose of the study is to know the incidence of salivary gland swellings and the usefulness of FNAC in evaluating these swellings. The present study is a time bound prospective study of fifty consecutive cases of salivary gland swellings admitted in our hospital during the period November 2014-August 2016. Most of the patients underwent pre-operative work up with FNAC and patients indicated for surgery underwent surgery and HPE. Salivary gland swelling occurred more commonly in 3rd decade of life and equal number of cases were seen in both genders. Most of the patients presented with salivary gland swelling (98%). 21 (42%) were non neoplastic, 29 (58%) were neoplastic swellings, 18 (36%) were benign of which pleomorphic adenoma was the most common and 11 (22%) were malignant of which adenoid cystic carcinoma was the most common. Parotid gland was the most common gland involved. Fine needle aspiration cytology was highly sensitive for benign tumours and highly specific for malignant tumours. FNAC should be first choice of investigation in evaluating the salivary gland pathologies. Early diagnosis and subsequent appropriate management carries good prognosis.

A correlation-based network for biomarker discovery in obesity with metabolic syndrome.tObesity is associated with chronic activation of the immune system and an altered gut microbiome, leading to increased risk of chronic disease development. As yet, no biomarker profile has been found to distinguish individuals at greater risk of obesity-related disease. The aim of this study was to explore a correlation-based network approach to identify existing patterns of immune-microbiome interactions in obesity.||||The current study performed correlation-based network analysis on five different datasets obtained from 11 obese with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and 12 healthy weight men. These datasets included: anthropometric measures, metabolic measures, immune cell abundance, serum cytokine concentration, and gut microbial composition. The obese with MetS group had a denser network (total number of edges, n = 369) compared to the healthy network (n = 299). Within the obese with MetS network, biomarkers from the immune cell abundance group was found to be correlated to biomarkers from all four other datasets. Conversely in the healthy network, immune cell abundance was only correlated with serum cytokine concentration and gut microbial composition. These observations suggest high involvement of immune cells in obese with MetS individuals. There were also three key hubs found among immune cells in the obese with MetS networks involving regulatory T cells, neutrophil and cytotoxic cell abundance. No hubs were present in the healthy network.||||These results suggest a more complex interaction of inflammatory markers in obesity, with high connectivity of immune cells in the obese with MetS network compared to the healthy network. Three key hubs were identified in the obese with MetS network, involving Treg, neutrophils and cytotoxic cell abundance. Compared to a t-test, the network approach offered more meaningful results when comparing obese with MetS and healthy weight individuals, demonstrating its superiority in exploratory analysis.

The present study aims to identify those miRNAs in patients with univentricular heart (UVH) disease that may be associated with overt heart failure.||||A large panel of human miRNA arrays were used to determine miRNA expression profiles in the blood of 48 UVH patients and 32 healthy controls. For further selection, the most abundantly expressed miRNA arrays were related to clinical measures of heart failure and selected miRNAs validated by polymerase chain reaction were used for the prediction of overt heart failure and all-cause mortality.||||According to microarray analysis, 50 miRNAs were found to be significantly abundant in UVH patients of which miR-150-5p was best related to heart failure parameters. According to ROC analysis, NT-proBNP levels (AUC 0.940, 95% CI 0.873-1.000; p = 0.001), miR-150-5p (AUC 0.905, 95% CI 0.779-1.000; p = 0.001) and a higher NYHA class ≥ III (AUC 0.893, 95% CI 0.713-1.000; p = 0.002) were the 3 most significant predictors of overt heart failure. Using a combined biomarker model, AUC increased to 0.980 indicating an additive value of miR-150-5p. Moreover, in the multivariate analysis, a higher NYHA class ≥ III (p = 0.005) and miR-150-5p (p = 0.006) turned out to be independent predictors of overt heart failure.||||In patients with UVH, miR-150-5p is an independent predictor of overt heart failure and thus may be used in the risk assessment of these patients.

Targeted silencing of MYCL1 by RNA interference inhibits migration and invasion of MGC-803 gastric cancer cells.tMYCL1 protein expression encoded by a proto-oncogene MYCL1, a member of the MYC family, is correlated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients. Nevertheless, the role of MYCL1 in gastric cancer cells remains unknown. In this study, the expression levels of MYCL1 mRNA and protein were downregulated by lentiviral-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) in the MGC-803 gastric cancer cell line. Then, the influence of MYCL1 on the biological behaviour of gastric cancer cells was investigated. Finally, a stable animal model of the MGC-803 human gastric cancer tumour model in nude mice was made successfully. Functionally, silencing of MYCL1 inhibited migration and invasion of the MGC-803 line in vitro and was accompanied with some ultrastructural changes. These results provide some evidences that lentiviral-mediated MYCL1 silencing may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of gastric cancer. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant tumours worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in China. Our previous study revealed that expression of MYCL1 in gastric cancer tissue was associated with poor prognosis of patients. However, the potential underlying mechanism is still unclear. In the current study, we displayed the influence of MYCL1 gene on invasion and migration phenotype of gastric cancer cells and provided a possible explanation from the aspect of structural alteration. Our results suggested that downregulation of MYCL1 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for gastric cancer.

Although infrequent in children, sudden cardiac death (SCD) is often an unexpected and tragic event.	Significance of automated external defibrillator in identifying lethal ventricular arrhythmias.tAutomated electrical defibrillator (AED) is critical in saving children who develop unexpected cardiac arrest (CA), but its diagnostic capacity is not fully acknowledged. Retrospective cohort study of patients with aborted sudden cardiac death (SCD) was performed. Twenty-five patients (14 males) aged 1.3 to 17.5 years who presented with CA survived with prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Eighteen patients had no prior cardiac diagnosis. Cardiac arrest occurred in 10 patients with more than moderate exercise, in 7 with light exercise, and in 8 at rest (including one during sleep). Twenty-two patients were resuscitated with AED, all of which were recognized as a shockable cardiac rhythm. Thorough investigations revealed 6 ion channelopathies (4 catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, one long QT syndrome, and one Brugada syndrome), 5 congenital heart disease (including 2 with coronary artery obstruction), 6 cardiomyopathies, 2 myocarditis, and 2 miscellaneous. Four patients had no identifiable heart disease. In 5 patients, the downloaded AED-recorded rhythm strip delineated the underlying arrhythmias and their responses to electrical shocks. Four patients who presented with generalized seizure at rest were initially managed for seizure disorder until AED recording identified lethal ventricular arrhythmias.Conclusions: AED reliably identifies the underlying lethal ventricular arrhythmias in addition to aborting SCD. What is Known: • Although infrequent in children, sudden cardiac death (SCD) is often an unexpected and tragic event. The etiology is diverse and sometimes remains unknown despite extensive investigations. • Automated external defibrillator (AED) is both therapeutic in aborting SCD and diagnostic in identifying the underlying lethal ventricular arrhythmias. However, the diagnostic aspect of AED is under-acknowledged by most medical providers. What is New: • Four of 25 patients (16%) were initially managed for possible seizure disorders until AED recording identified lethal ventricular arrhythmia. • The AED recording of the lethal arrhythmia during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should always be obtained as it plays a crucial role in the decision-making process before ICD implantation. All medical providers should become familiar with downloading cardiac rhythm strips from AED when requested.

Does cochlear implantation influence postural stability in patients with hearing loss?tCochlear implantation (CI) procedure carries the potential risk for vestibular system insult or stimulation with resultant dysfunction due to its proximity to the cochlea. The vestibular system plays an essential role in crucial tasks such as postural control, gaze stabilization and spatial orientation.||||How does standard cochlear implantation influence postural stability in patients with hearing loss?||||The study included 21 individuals (age 51 ± 18 years) qualified to undergo CI due to severe or profound hearing loss. Participants were qualified for both groups by a physician based on an interview, an otoneurological examination and vestibular tests. The first group included patients without vestibular dysfunction, whereas the other group consisted of persons with vestibular dysfunction. The research methodology included medical examinations, anthropometric measurements and stabilometry on the Biodex Balance System SD (BBS) platform. The examinations were carried out twice, i.e. prior to and 3 months post implantation. The recorded data was compared between the first and the second examination using a non-parametric Wilcoxon test. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's post-hoc HSD unequal sample sizes were performed for patients with and without vestibular dysfunction.||||Study showed that 52.4% of the participants obtained results within the norm, while 47.6% scored below it. The comparison of stability indices of the examined individuals, with and without vestibular dysfunction, did not reveal statistically significant differences. The only difference was the anterior-posterior stability index assessed in static conditions. Three months after the implantation, no changes in the majority of indices were noted, with the exception of anterior-posterior stability index, which improved following the implantation. CI does not affect postural stability changes in the study participants.

Prolactinomas and nonfunctioning adenomas: preoperative diagnosis of tumor type using serum prolactin and tumor size.tProlactinoma and nonfunctioning adenoma (NFA) are the most common sellar pathologies, and both can present with hyperprolactinemia. There are no definitive studies analyzing the relationship between the sizes of prolactinomas and NFAs and the serum prolactin level. Current guidelines for serum prolactin level cutoffs to distinguish between pathologies are suboptimal because they fail to consider the adenoma volume. In this study, the authors attempted to describe the relationship between serum prolactin level and prolactinoma volume. They also examined the predictive value that can be gained by considering tumor volume in differentiating prolactinoma from NFA and provide cutoff values based on a large sample of patients.||||A retrospective analysis of consecutive patients with prolactinomas (n = 76) and NFAs (n = 217) was performed. Patients were divided into groups based on adenoma volume, and the two pathologies were compared.||||A strong correlation was found between prolactinoma volume and serum prolactin level (r = 0.831, p < 0.001). However, there was no significant correlation between NFA volume and serum prolactin level (r = -0.020, p = 0.773). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of three different adenoma volume groups was performed and resulted in different serum prolactin level cutoffs for each group. For group 1 (≤ 0.5 cm3), the most accurate cutoff was 43.65 μg/L (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.951); for group 2 (> 0.5 to 4 cm3), 60.05 μg/L (AUC = 0.949); and for group 3 (> 4 cm3), 248.15 μg/L (AUC = 1.0).||||Prolactinoma volume has a significant impact on serum prolactin level, whereas NFA volume does not. This finding indicates that the amount of prolactin-producing tissue is a more important factor regarding serum prolactin level than absolute adenoma volume. Hence, volume should be a determining factor to distinguish between prolactinoma and NFA prior to surgery. Current serum prolactin threshold level guidelines are suboptimal and cannot be generalized across all adenoma volumes.

Cause of postprandial vomiting - a giant retroperitoneal ganglioneuroma enclosing large blood vessels: A case report.tGanglioneuroma (GN) is a rare neurogenic tumor that accounts for about 0.1%-0.5% of all tumors of the nervous system. It originates from neural crest cells. GN has no specific clinical symptoms or laboratory findings, which leaves it easily overlooked and misdiagnosed as other tumors. Retroperitoneal GN with very large volume and vascular penetration is extremely rare.||||We present the imaging and pathological findings of a giant retroperitoneal GN in a child. A 4-year-old boy had suffered from postprandial vomiting for more than 6 mo with no precipitating factors. Abdominal computerized tomographic examination showed a giant cystic mass in the retroperitoneal area. After injection of contrast agent, the mass showed heterogeneous enhancement. Surgery with local excision of the mass was performed to address the embedded abdominal blood vessels, and the histopathological and immunohistochemical diagnosis of the mass was GN. Postprandial vomiting was relieved, and no complications occurred after the operation.||||In the diagnosis of giant retroperitoneal hypodense masses in children, GN should be considered if the mass presents delayed enhancement, punctate calcification, and vascular embedding but no invasion. Pathology is the golden standard for the diagnosis of GN, and surgical excision is the optimal treatment for GN.

Phenotypic manifestations between male and female children with CDKL5 mutations.tCyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5), which maps to chromosome Xp22.13 and contains 20 coding exons, has been recognized as the gene responsible for early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (EoEE). A retrospective study is carried out to analyze potential genotypic and phenotypic differences between male and female patients with CDKL5 mutations.||||Targeted next-generation DNA sequencing was employed to search for mutations in patients with cryptogenic EE. A total of 44 patients with EoEE/infantile spasms (ISs)/West syndrome were enrolled for pathogenic mutation screening. The clinical phenotypes of patients with CDKL5 mutations were analyzed and compared with those of 166 published cases.||||One novel and three recurrent mutations were found in four enrolled patients (two boys and two girls). One female patient had partial seizures during the early infantile period and epileptic spasms and tonic seizures several weeks thereafter. The other female patient had IS with hypsarrhythmia. The two male patients had IS without typical hypsarrhythmia and were bedridden. Brain MRIs of the male patients revealed brain atrophy and white matter hyperintensity. The female patients exhibited autistic features with hand stereotypies.||||Our study highlights that both girls and boys with IS harbor CDKL5 mutations. Male children with CDKL5 mutations demonstrate a higher frequency of infantile spasms and brain atrophy, whereas female children often exhibit atypical Rett syndrome with EoEE.

Thyroid-like follicular carcinoma of the kidney presenting on a 10 year-old prepubertal girl.tThe very rare thyroid-like carcinoma of the kidney (TLCK) is microscopically similar to thyroid follicular cell carcinoma (TFCC). Differential diagnosis with secondary thyroid tumors depends on non-reactivity to immunohistochemical (IHC) markers for TFCC (thyroglobulin - TG and TTF1). We herein describe the fourth Pediatric case in literature and extensively review the subject. Only 29 cases were published to the moment. Most cases were asymptomatic and incidentally detected. Most tumors are hyperechoic and hyperdense with low grade heterogenous enhancement on CT and MRI. Most patients were treated with radical nephrectomy, but partial nephrectomy was used in some cases, apparently with the same results. Metastases are uncommon and apparently do not change prognosis, but follow-ups are limited. Up to the moment, TLCK presents as a low grade malignancy that may be treated exclusively with surgery and frequently with partial kidney renal preservation. A preoperative percutaneous biopsy is a common procedure to investigate atypical tumors in childhood and adult tumors. To recognize the possibility of TLCK is fundamental to avoid unnecessary thyroidectomies in those patients, supposing a primary thyroid tumor.

A decade of clinical development of PARP inhibitors in perspective.tGenomic instability is a hallmark of cancer, and often is the result of altered DNA repair capacities in tumour cells. DNA damage repair defects are common in different cancer types; these alterations can also induce tumour-specific vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically. In 2009, a first-in-man clinical trial of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib clinically validated the synthetic lethal interaction between inhibition of PARP1, a key sensor of DNA damage, and BRCA1/BRCA2 deficiency. In this review, we summarize a decade of PARP inhibitor clinical development, a work that has resulted in the registration of several PARP inhibitors in breast (olaparib and talazoparib) and ovarian cancer (olaparib, niraparib and rucaparib, either alone or following platinum chemotherapy as maintenance therapy). Over the past 10 years, our knowledge on the mechanism of action of PARP inhibitor as well as how tumours become resistant has been extended, and we summarise this work here. We also discuss opportunities for expanding the precision medicine approach with PARP inhibitors, identifying a wider population who could benefit from this drug class. This includes developing and validating better predictive biomarkers for patient stratification, mainly based on homologous recombination defects beyond BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations, identifying DNA repair deficient tumours in other cancer types such as prostate or pancreatic cancer, or by designing combination therapies with PARP inhibitors.

Metabolic tumor volume and conformal radiotherapy based on prognostic PET/CT for treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.tFor patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), prognostic indicators to customize subsequent biologically conformal radiation therapy may be obtained via 2-(fluorine-18)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). This retrospective study assessed the prognostic significance and feasibility of conformal radiotherapy for NPC, based on F-FDG PET/CT. Eighty-two patients with NPC underwent F-FDG PET/CT prior to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) of the primary tumor were measured, with MTVx based on absolute SUVx values ≥ specific threshold x on each axial image. The cut-off SUVmax and MTV values for predicting 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated according to a receiver operating characteristic curve. Assessed were correlations between SUVmax and MTV and between threshold x and MTVx, and the MTV percentage of the primary tumor volume at threshold x. The SUVmax and MTV were positively associated, as were MTV and primary tumor volume. Primary tumor volume, SUVmax, and MTV were significant predictors of survival. The 3-year PFS rates for SUVmax ≤8.20 and >8.20 were 91.1% and 73.0%, respectively (P = .027). With furthermore analysis, patients having tumor with smaller MTV had higher 3-year PFS than patients having tumor with larger MTV. The 3-year PFS rate was inversely related to MTV. SUVmax and MTV, derived by PET/CT, are important for assessing prognosis and planning radiotherapy for patients with NPC. Small MTV indicated better 3-year PFS compared with large MTV. For the best therapeutic effect, MTV4.0 was the best subvolume to determine radiotherapy boost.

Microsatellite instability detection using a large next-generation sequencing cancer panel across diverse tumour types.tMicrosatellite instability (MSI), a hallmark of DNA mismatch repair deficiency, is a key molecular biomarker with multiple clinical implications including the selection of patients for immunotherapy, identifying patients who may have Lynch syndrome and predicting prognosis in patients with colorectal tumours. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides the opportunity to interrogate large numbers of microsatellite loci concurrently with genomic variants. We sought to develop a method to detect MSI that would not require paired normal tissue and would leverage the sequence data obtained from a broad range of tumours tested using our 467-gene NGS Columbia Combined Cancer Panel (CCCP).||||Altered mononucleotide and dinucleotide microsatellite loci across the CCCP region of interest were evaluated in clinical samples encompassing a diverse range of tumour types. The number of altered loci was used to develop a decision tree classifier model trained on the retrospectively collected cohort of 107 clinical cases sequenced by the CCCP assay.||||The classifier was able to correctly classify all cases and was then used to analyse a test set of clinical cases (n=112) and was able to correctly predict their MSI status with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Analysis of recurrently altered loci identified alterations in genes involved in DNA repair, signalling and transcriptional regulation pathways, many of which have been implicated in MSI tumours.||||This study highlights the utility of this approach, which should be applicable to laboratories performing similar testing.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the cut-off of NLNs. Nomograms were constructed and validated using SEER data and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, respectively. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using edgeR. Enrichment analyses were performed by Metascape.|||| low). Transcriptomics analysis demonstrated histone modifiers were the most significant different biological processes between the high and low NLN group.||||The NLN-based models can aid in personalized risk stratification for colon cancer. This study postulates that high NLN may represent a biological subtype with less macrophage infiltration, high MSI status, hypermutation, and histone modifier gene enriched expression, and thus warrants further investigation.

Effects of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir therapy on chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 4, infected children of 3-6 years of age.tTreatment of children aged 3-6 genotype 4 is still limited by the interferon side effects. We aimed in this study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir in children (3-6 years) genotype 4 chronic HCV-infected patients.||||In total, 22 consecutive chronic HCV-infected patients (mean age 4.8 ± 0.9years, 19 males) were included in this prospective study. All patients received sofosbuvir 200 mg/ledipasvir 45 mg in a single oral daily dose. Patients were randomly subdivided into two groups according the duration of treatment into 8 and 12 weeks. All the clinical and laboratory data were collected. All the side effects were recorded from the patients or their parents. Follow-up were made at Week 4, 8 and 12 and 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12).||||The overall SVR12 rate was 100%. At Week 4, 9/11 patients in the 12-week group (81.8%; 95% CI: 52.3%-94.7%) achieved virologic negativity, vs 10/11 (90.9%; 95% CI: 62.3%-98.4%) in the 8-week group. At Week 8, 10/11 (90.8%; 95% CI: 62.3%-98.4%) in the 12-week group vs 11/11 (100%; 95% CI: 74.1%-100%) in the 8-week group were virologically negative. The reported side effects were cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea especially early in the treatment. The main complaint was difficulty in swallowing the tablets in the youngest patient at the beginning of the course of treatment. All patients were compliant to treatment.||||Sofosbuvir/ledipasvir combination is safe and tolerable in the chronic infected HCV genotype 4 infected children (3-6 years). The 8-week treatment duration is similarly effective as the 12-week duration.

Influence of E-cadherin genetic variation in canine mammary tumour risk, clinicopathological features and prognosis.tE-cadherin is a cell adhesion molecule that participates in several cellular processes that guarantee the maintenance of structural and functional integrity of epithelial tissues. E-cadherin plays an important role in mammary carcinogenesis, and various studies have demonstrated the effect of CDH1 genetic variation in risk, progression and biological behaviour of human breast cancer. Although there are some recognized genetic variations in canine CDH1 gene, their influence in canine mammary tumour development and progression has not been previously evaluated. In this study, we aim to assess the influence of CDH1 SNPs rs850805755, rs852280880 and rs852639930 in the risk, clinicopathological features and clinical outcome of canine mammary tumours. A case-control study was conducted involving 206 bitches with mammary tumours and 161 bitches free of mammary neoplasia. CDH1 SNPs rs850805755 and rs852280880 were associated with a decreased risk and a later onset of mammary tumour development. Furthermore, these SNPs were related to the development of small size carcinomas, of low histological grade and low nuclear pleomorphism. SNP rs852639930 was associated with the development of small size tumours with a non-infiltrative, non-invasive growth pattern. Data from the present investigation demonstrate that these CDH1 genetic variants could have a protective role in canine mammary tumours, by being associated with low risk of tumour development, delayed onset of the disease and less aggressive clinicopathological features.

Role of Exosomes in Crosstalk Between Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts and Cancer Cells.tCancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are important cells of the tumor microenvironment that can communicate with tumor cells through various mechanisms. Recently, increasing studies have found that exosomes transmit biological information by carrying microRNAs, lncRNAs, proteins, metabolites, and other substances, and thus exert biological and therapeutic effects. CAF-secreted exosomes can also affect the tumor phenotype, while the exosomes released by tumor cells can activate CAFs. Here, we review the role of exosomes in the crosstalk between CAFs and tumor cells and elaborate its mechanism.

SMARCB1 (INI-1)-Deficient Adenocarcinoma of the Sinonasal Tract: A Potentially Under-Recognized form of Sinonasal Adenocarcinoma with Occasional Yolk Sac Tumor-Like Features.tThe classification of sinonasal adenocarcinoma (SNAC) is complex. The high-grade, non-intestinal SNAC group is particularly heterogeneous, with tumors showing widely variable morphology. SMARCB1 (INI-1)-deficient sinonasal carcinoma is a newly described, aggressive tumor that usually resembles sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) or non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma; however, glandular differentiation has been rarely reported and this feature may be under-recognized. We present a dedicated series of 12 SMARCB1-deficient SNACs. All tumors had an oncocytoid/plasmacytoid cytomorphology with variable degrees of glandular differentiation consisting of tubules and cribriform structures with foci of intracellular or intraluminal mucin. Three of 12 tumors exhibited foci of yolk sac tumor-like histologic features. The tumors were uniformly high-grade, with nuclear pleomorphism, elevated mitotic rates and frequent necrosis. By immunohistochemistry, all tumors were entirely SMARCB1-deficient, and 10 of 12 were CK7-positive. Occasional expression of CDX2 (4 of 12), CK20 (3 of 12), and p40 (3 of 10) was seen. Expression of yolk sac markers was variably present in tumors that harbored yolk sac-like areas but also tumors that did not: glypican-3 (10 of 11), SALL4 (6 of 11), HepPar-1 (4 of 11), PLAP (1 of 10), and AFP (1 of 11). SMARCB1-deficient sinonasal carcinoma, particularly the oncocytoid/plasmacytoid form, can demonstrate variable degrees of glandular differentiation. This unexpected morphology combined with variable immunohistochemical results may lead to misdiagnoses of high-grade intestinal or non-intestinal SNAC, myoepithelial carcinoma, or even yolk sac tumor or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.

Complex management decisions in a woman with concurrent primary hyperparathyroidism and metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma, both presenting during pregnancy.tA 40-year-old woman was hospitalised at 25-week gestation following a diagnosis of severe symptomatic hypercalcaemia (adjusted serum calcium 3.02 mmol/L). A diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP) was made on the basis of elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) 11.2 pmol/L (reference range 1.5-6.9) and exclusion of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia. Ultrasound examination of the neck did not convincingly demonstrate an abnormal or enlarged parathyroid gland and parathyroid scintigraphy was not performed due to maternal choice relating to perceived radiation risk to the foetus. At neck exploration during the 28th week of pregnancy a right lower pole parathyroid lesion was excised together with two abnormal lymph nodes (largest 1.6 cm). Histology confirmed a parathyroid adenoma and also papillary thyroid carcinoma deposits in the two resected lymph nodes. Post-operatively, levels of adjusted serum calcium normalised and pregnancy progressed uneventfully to term. Total thyroidectomy was performed 2 weeks after delivery revealing two small foci of papillary micro-carcinoma (largest 2.3 mm, one in each thyroid lobe) with no evidence of further metastatic tumour in lymph nodes removed during functional neck dissection. Radioiodine remnant ablation (RRA) was performed 2 months post thyroidectomy to allow for breast involution. The patient remains in full clinical and biochemical remission 9 years later. We present and review the difficult management decisions faced in relation to the investigation and treatment of PHP in pregnancy, further complicated by incidentally discovered locally metastatic pT1aN1aM0 papillary thyroid carcinoma.||||PHP may have serious consequences during pregnancy and usually requires surgical management during pregnancy to reduce the risk of maternal and foetal complications. The indications for and optimal timing of surgical management are discussed. Localisation by parathyroid scintigraphy is controversial during pregnancy: modified dose regimes may be considered in preference as an alternative to unguided neck exploration. Breastfeeding is contraindicated for 6-8 weeks before radioactive-iodine remnant ablation (RRA) to prevent increased breast uptake. Breastfeeding is further contra-indicated until after a subsequent pregnancy. Incidentally discovered differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) in cervical lymph nodes in some cases may be managed expectantly because in one quarter of thyroidectomies the primary tumour remains occult.

NRAS associated RASopathy and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.tRASopathies are a group of phenotypically overlapping disorders that arise from dysregulation of the RAS/MAPK pathway. These disorders include Noonan syndrome, Costello syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, and neurofibromatosis-Type 1. While somatic mutations in the three human Ras genes (KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS) are a common finding in a variety of cancers, germline mutations in each of the these genes cause developmental RASopathy phenotypes with mutations in specific genes typically correlating with specific phenotypes. We present the case of a germline heterozygous NRAS mutation producing a severe phenotype involving embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, severe intellectual disability, and numerous melanocytic nevi in addition to more typical manifestations of Noonan syndrome. Additionally, the specific p.G12R NRAS mutation in this case is a common somatic mutation in cancer cells, and analysis of previously reported NRAS-RASopathy cases suggests that mutations at traditionally oncogenic codons are associated with elevated cancer risk not present with mutations at other sites.

Primary osteosarcoma of the skull in teenager.tOsteosarcoma of the skull is a rare primary malignant bone tumour in children, representing 1-2% of all cranial tumours. We describe a case of a 17-year-old adolescent with chondroblastic osteosarcoma of the parietal-occipital bone and no distant metastases at presentation treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery and, later, concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The patient suffered progressive disease and died 15 months after diagnosis. There are at least 15 paediatric cases of osteosarcoma of the skull described in the literature. Due to its rarity, there are no broad prospective studies on this entity, which has distinctive features when compared to other craniofacial tumours, carrying a worse prognosis. Complete surgical resection is needed for long-term survival, whereas chemotherapy and radiotherapy have still questionable indications.

Comparison of the prevalence and features of inner ear malformations in congenital unilateral and bilateral hearing loss.tThe aim of the study was to clarify differences in the prevalence and features of bony malformations in inner ear between congenital unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (USNHL) and congenital bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (BSNHL).||||We conducted a retrospective study of 378 consecutive infants referred from routine newborn hearing screening in the past 18 years. Clinical background, audiological data, and temporal bone computed tomography (CT) findings were analyzed. The prevalence of malformations between USNHL and BSNHL groups were compared using the Chi-square test.||||The proportion of family history of hearing loss was significantly higher in infants with BSNHL than in those with USNHL (26/107 [24.3%] vs. 4/105 [3.7%]; p = 0.0001). Temporal bone CT scanning revealed significantly a higher prevalence of inner ear malformations in infants with USNHL than in those with BSNHL (93/109 [85.3%] vs. 4/107 [3.7%]; p < 0.0001). The most frequent anomaly in USNHL was cochlear nerve canal stenosis (69.7%), followed by cochlear malformations (20.2%), and narrow internal auditory canal (17.4%). Four infants with BSNHL accompanied by inner ear anomaly had complications such as Down's syndrome, developmental delay, or epilepsy.||||The prevalence of bony malformations in inner ear and/or IAC was markedly higher in infants with congenital USNHL than in infants with BSNHL. Temporal bone CT scanning may help to clarify the etiology of congenital hearing loss, especially in USNHL.

Liver stiffness as a predictor of hepatocellular carcinoma behavior in patients with hepatitis C related liver cirrhosis.tRisk stratification and prognostication of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) help to improve patient outcome. Herein we investigated the role of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) in the prediction of HCC behavior.||||Totally 121 naïve patients with HCC were included. HCC radiological evaluation and staging were done. LSM was measured using virtual touch quantification. Patients were divided into early to intermediate HCC (BCLC-0, A and B) and late HCC (BCLCC and D). HCC was treated according to the BCLC stage. HCC recurrence-free interval was estimated.||||The mean LSM inside the tumor was significantly lower than the peri-tumoral area and the cirrhotic non-cancerous liver parts (P < 0.001). In late HCCs stage, the mean LSM inside the tumor and in the peri-tumoral tissue was lower than the corresponding values in the early to intermediate HCCs stage (P < 0.001). LSM inside the tumor and in the peri-tumoral tissue negatively correlated with serum AFP, tumor vascular invasion, and stage (P < 0.05). The recurrence-free interval was directly correlated to LSM inside the tumor and inversely to LSM in cirrhotic non tumorous liver part. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the recurrence-free interval was significantly longer in patients with LSM inside the tumor of ≥1.25 m/s compared to those with LSM inside the tumor of <1.25 m/s.||||LSM can serve as a potential non-invasive predictor for HCC clinical behavior and the recurrence-free interval following loco-regional treatments.

Prostaglandin E2 as a potent therapeutic target for treatment of colon cancer.tAlthough colon cancer is one of the most important triggers of cancer related mortality, a few therapeutic options exist for this disease, including combination chemotherapy, anti-EGFR and anti-angiogenic agents. However, none of these therapeutics are fully effective for complete remission, and this issue needs further investigations, particularly in the patients with advanced disease. It has been shown that colon carcinogenesis process is associated with upregulation of prostaglandin (PG) levels. Moreover, conversion of pre-malignant cells to malignant was also related with increased generation of PGs in susceptible subjects. Among the prostanoids, PGE2 is the most important produced member which generated in high levels by colon tumor cells. Generation of PGE2 by action of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 can promote growth and development, resistance to apoptosis, proliferation, invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis and drug resistance in colon cancer. Increased levels of PGE2 and COX-2 in colon cancer is reported by various investigators which was associated with disease progression. It is suggested that there is a positive feedback loop between COX-2 and PGE2, in which function of COX-2 induces generation of PGE2, and upregulation of PGE2 increases the expression of COX-2 in colon cancer. Although an existence of this feedback loop is well-documented, its precise mechanism, signaling pathways, and the particular E-type prostanoid (EP) receptor mediating this feedback are elusive. Therefore, it seems that targeting COX-2/PGE2/EP receptors may be supposed as a potent therapeutic strategy for treatment of colon cancer. In this review, we try to clarify the role of PGE2 in cancer progression and its targeting for treatment of colon cancer.

The initiation, design, and establishment of the Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation Patient Registry and Natural History Study.tDesmoid tumors are locally invasive sarcoma, affecting 5-6 individuals out of 1,000,000 per year. The desmoid tumors have high rates of recurrence after resection and can lead to significant deterioration of the quality of life of patients. There is a need for a better understanding of the desmoid tumors' patient experience from first symptoms through diagnosis, disease monitoring, and clinical treatment options. With the National Organization of Rare Disorders, the Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation Natural History Study was designed to be collected through the registry. This article describes the protocol for the Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation Natural History Study and some initial findings. The Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation Natural History Study Advisory Committee developed a series of questionnaires and longitudinal surveys, in addition to those from the National Organization of Rare Disorders for all of the rare diseases. These 13 surveys are designed to uncover initial symptoms, diagnosis process, disease monitoring, quality of life, treatments, as well as socioeconomic information. Since launching the Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation Registry and Natural History Study (https://dtrf.iamrare.org), more than 300 desmoid tumor patients have consented to the Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation Natural History Study and completed the Participant Profile. The majority of the respondents are between the ages of 21 and 50 years (76%), female (81.2%), White (91.5%), and live in the United States (47.1%). The majority of tumors are in the lower or upper extremity, (22.9%) followed closely by abdominal desmoid tumors (21.5%). Most are willing to donate specimens (89.9%) and participate in trials (97.2%). Ongoing efforts are addressing the demographic differences between the respondents and non-respondents and any selection bias based on access to the registry and study. The Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation Natural History Study is built on the largest desmoid tumors registry and has recruited more desmoid tumors participants since launching in September 2017. It will serve to fill desmoid tumors knowledge gaps and assist other researchers in their recruitment efforts for additional studies.

Given that 7 of the first 10 cases with positive genetic study were carriers of a single mutation in the LDLR gene [p.(Tyr400_Phe402del)], a specific polymerase chain reaction-based assay was developed for the detection of this variant as a first screening step on the remaining subjects. In those without this mutation, molecular diagnosis was completed using a next-generation sequencing panel including LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, LDLRAP1, APOE, STAP1, and LIPA genes and incorporating copy number variation detection in LDLR.||||On the whole, 44 subjects (62%) had a positive genetic study, of whom 30 (68%) were heterozygous carriers of the p.(Tyr400_Phe402del) variant. Eleven subjects carried other mutations in LDLR, including the novel mutation NM_000527.4: c.877dupG; NP_000518.1: p.(Asp293Glyfs*8). An unclassified PCSK9 gene variant was found in one subject [(NM_174936.3:c.1496G>A; NP_777596.2: p.(Arg499His)]. Other single patients had mutations in APOB (heterozygous) and in LIPA (homozygous). All identified variants co-segregated with the disease phenotype.||||These findings suggest a founder effect for the p.(Tyr400_Phe402del) LDLR mutation in Gran Canaria. A cost-effective local screening strategy for genetic diagnosis of FH could be implemented in this region.

Adult outcome after neurosurgical treatment of brain tumours in the first year of life: long-term follow-up of a single consecutive institutional series of 34 patients.tLong-term results for adult patients who underwent surgery for paediatric brain tumours in the first year of life have not been reported.||||We performed a retrospective study on surgical morbidity, mortality rate, academic achievement and/or work participation in patients who underwent primary tumour resection for a brain tumour as infants in the period from 1973 to 1998. Gross motor function and activities of daily life were scored according to the Barthel Index.||||Thirty-four consecutive children were included. No patient was lost to follow-up. Twenty-two children (65%) underwent gross total resection (GTR), 10 had subtotal resections (STR) and 2 had only partial resection during primary surgery. Nine children were additionally surgically treated for hydrocephalus (HC), many of them with repeat operations for shunt malfunction during follow-up. Three children died within 30 days following GTR of highly vascular tumours. Seventeen (50%) of the infants had high-grade tumours with 1-month, 1-year and 20-year survival figures of 88, 30 and 30%. The corresponding figures for 17 patients treated for low-grade tumours were 94%, 88% and 88%, respectively. Seventeen patients (50%) are still alive as adult long-term survivors at median age of 29 years (range 20 to 43 years). Three died after 29, 30 and 41 years, respectively. At the latest follow-up, 16 out of 17 long-term survivors have a Barthel Index (BI) of 100, while the remaining one has a BI of 40. Two long-term survivors of a high-grade tumour treated 30 and 35 years ago are severely handicapped and have no working capacity. The 15 long-term survivors after treatment for a low-grade tumour are all in daily activity as students (4), in part-time work (3) or full-time work (8).||||A brain tumour occurring in the first year of life is a serious threat to the patient and the family, particularly in case of high-grade tumours. In our small cohort, the results from long-term survivors of high-grade tumour group are depressing and confirm the deleterious effect of radiotherapy given to infants decades ago. The infants with low-grade tumours who could be treated with surgical resection without any adjuvant therapy show a good clinical outcome as adults. For parents of these latter patients, the results are far better than feared in advance.

Transferrin-decorated thymoquinone-loaded PEG-PLGA nanoparticles exhibit anticarcinogenic effect in non-small cell lung carcinoma via the modulation of miR-34a and miR-16.tNon-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is a highly lethal type of cancer with limited therapeutic avenues available to date. In the present study, we formulated PEGylated PLGA thymoquinone nanoparticles (TQ-Np) for improved TQ delivery to NSCLC cells. Transferrin (TF), a biodegradable, non-immunogenic and non-toxic protein, is well known to bind to TFR (transferrin receptor) over-expressed in non-small cell lung carcinoma A549 cells. Thus, the further decoration of the PEGylated PLGA thymoquinone nanoparticles with transferrin (TF-TQ-Np) enhanced the internalization of the nanoparticles within the A549 cells and the activity of TQ. We established TF-TQ-Np as a potent anti-tumorigenic agent through the involvement of p53 and the ROS feedback loop in regulating the microRNA (miRNA) circuitry to control apoptosis and migration of NSCLC cells. TF-TQ-Np-mediated p53 up-regulation favored the potential simultaneous activation of miR-34a and miR-16 targeting Bcl2 to induce apoptosis in the A549 cells. Additionally, TF-TQ-Np also restricted the migration through actin de-polymerization via activation of the p53/miR-34a axis. Further studies in chick CAM xenograft models confirmed the anti-cancer activity of TF-TQ-Np by controlling the p53/miR-34a/miR-16 axis. Furthermore, in vivo experiments conducted in a xenograft model in immunosuppressed Balb/c mice also proved the efficacy of the nanoparticles as an antitumor agent against NSCLC. Thus, our findings cumulatively suggest that the transferrin-adorned TQ-Np successfully coupled two distinct miRNA pathways to potentiate the apoptotic death cascade in the very lethal NSCLC cells and also restricts the migration of these cells without imparting any significant toxicity, which occurs in the widely used chemotherapeutic combinations. Thereby, our findings rekindle new hopes for the development of improved targeted therapeutic options with specified molecular objectives for combating the deadly NSCLC.

Genetic reduction of MMP-9 in the Fmr1 KO mouse partially rescues prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle response.tSensory processing abnormalities are consistently associated with autism, but the underlying mechanisms and treatment options are unclear. Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading known genetic cause of intellectual disabilities and autism. One debilitating symptom of FXS is hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli. Sensory hypersensitivity is seen in both humans with FXS and FXS mouse model, the Fmr1 knock out (Fmr1 KO) mouse. Abnormal sensorimotor gating may play a role in the hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli. Humans with FXS and Fmr1 KO mice show abnormalities in acoustic startle response (ASR) and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle, responses commonly used to quantify sensorimotor gating. Recent studies have suggested high levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) as a potential mechanism of sensory abnormalities in FXS. Here we tested the hypothesis that genetic reduction of MMP-9 in Fmr1 KO mice rescues ASR and PPI phenotypes in adult Fmr1 KO mice. We measured MMP-9 levels in the inferior colliculus (IC), an integral region of the PPI circuit, of WT and Fmr1 KO mice at P7, P12, P18, and P40. MMP-9 levels were higher in the IC of Fmr1 KO mice during early development (P7, P12), but not in adults. We compared ASR and PPI responses in young (P23-25) and adult (P50-80) Fmr1 KO mice to their age-matched wildtype (WT) controls. We found that both ASR and PPI were reduced in the young Fmr1 KO mice compared to age-matched WT mice. There was no genotype difference for ASR in the adult mice, but PPI was significantly reduced in the adult Fmr1 KO mice. The adult mouse data are similar to those observed in humans with FXS. Genetic reduction of MMP-9 in the Fmr1 KO mice resulted in a rescue of adult PPI responses to WT levels. Taken together, these results show sensorimotor gating abnormalities in Fmr1 KO mice, and suggest the potential for MMP-9 regulation as a therapeutic target to reduce sensory hypersensitivity.

DPP-4 is a member of serine proteases, and more than 30 substrates have been identified that act via several biochemical messengers in a variety of tissues including kidney. Intriguingly, DPP-4 actions on the diabetic kidney is a complex mechanism, and a variety of pathways are involved including increasing GLP-1/SDF-1, disrupting AGE-RAGE pathways, and integrin-β- and TGF-β-Smad-mediated signalling pathways that finally lead to endothelial to mesenchymal transition. Interestingly, an array of DPP-4 inhibitors is well recognized as oral drugs to treat type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients, which promote better glycemic control. Furthermore, recent experimental and preclinical data reveal that DPP-4 inhibitors may also exhibit protective effects in renal disease progression including anti-fibrotic effects in the diabetic kidney by attenuating above signalling cascade(s), either singly or as a combinatorial effect. In this review, we discussed the anti-fibrotic effects of DPP-4 inhibitors based on recent reports along with the possible mechanism of actions and future perspectives to underscore the beneficial effects of DPP-4 inhibitors in DN.||||With recent experimental, preclinical, and clinical evidence, we summarized DPP-4 activities and its mechanism of actions in diabetic kidney diseases. A knowledge gap of DPP-4 inhibition in controlling renal fibrosis in DN has also been postulated in this review for future research perspectives.

PDL-1 is gaining an important role in the therapeutic arsenal of lung cancer, the most frequent cancer worldwide. We report for the first time a negativation of PDL-1 status in 2 cases of stage IIIA NSCLC with conversion to operable disease after using immunotherapy. The first patient was a 59-year old female diagnosed incidentally to have stage IIIA inoperable NSCLC that was treated with combination chemo-immunotherapy, and converted to operable disease with a negative PD-L1 in the postoperative setting. The second case is that of a 56-year old male that also had an inoperable stage IIIA NSCLC treated with chemotherapy first line followed by pembrolizumab at progression, then operated after surgical conversion, with negative PD-L1 postoperatively. In front of these findings, further work should be done to elucidate if the reverse of the PDL-1 status and the conversion to operability were due to the use of immunotherapy or to an incidental finding. If confirmed, it may have a therapeutic impact.

However, its expression and anti-metastatic ability in RCC are still unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that MAGI1 was markedly decreased in the RCC and indicated poor survival. Furthermore, we found that MAGI1 suppressed the invasion and migration of human RCC cells. Mechanistic investigations revealed that MAGI1 stabilized the PTEN/MAGI1/β-catenin complex to inhibit β-catenin signaling pathway.

Construction and Validation of Nomograms for Predicting Overall Survival and Cancer-Specific Survival in Nonmetastatic Inflammatory Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Tri-Modality Therapy: A Population-Based Study.tBACKGROUND As the most aggressive breast cancer, inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) has a poor prognosis. However, analyzing the prognostic factors of IBC is challenging due to its rarity. We identified the prognostic factors to establish predictive tools for survival in nonmetastatic IBC patients who received tri-modality therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS The data of 893 nonmetastatic IBC patients were acquired from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. IBC was identified by "ICD-O-3=8530" or "AJCC T, 7th=T4d"). Patients were randomized to the training (n=668) and validation (n=225) cohorts. Prognostic factors were identified in the training cohort. Factors in the nomogram for overall survival (OS) were filtered by the least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) regression model. Factors selected by the competing-risk models were integrated to construct nomograms for breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). Nomogram validation was performed in both cohorts. RESULTS The number of positive lymph nodes contributed the most to both nomograms. In the validation cohort, the C-indexes for OS and BCSS were 0.724 and 0.727, respectively. Calibration curves demonstrated acceptable agreement between predicted and actual survival. Risk scores were calculated from the nomograms and used to split patients into the low-risk and high-risk groups. Smooth hazard ratio (HR) curves and Kaplan-Meier curves showed a statistically significant difference in prognosis between the high-risk group and low-risk group (log-rank P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS We unveiled the prognostic factors of nonmetastatic IBC and formulated nomograms to predict survival. In these models, the likelihood of individual survival can be easily calculated, which may assist clinicians in selecting treatment regimens.

Epigenetic signatures have been suggested as good biomarkers for early detection, prognosis and targeted therapy of BC. Here, we highlight studies documenting the modifying effects of DFAs and obesity on BC biomarkers associated with DNA methylation. We focus our analysis on changes elicited in writers of DNA methylation (i.e., DNA methyltransferases), global DNA methylation and gene-specific DNA methylation. To provide context, we precede this discussion with a review of the available evidence for an association between BC incidence and both dietary fat consumption and obesity. We also include a review of well-vetted BC biomarkers related to CpG methylation and how they influence BC risk, prognosis, tumor characteristics and response to therapies.

Monitoring Progression of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ Using Photoacoustics and Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound.tBreast cancer is the leading form of cancer in women, accounting for approximately 41,400 deaths in 2018. While a variety of risk factors have been identified, physical exercise has been linked to reducing both the risk and aggressiveness of breast cancer. Within breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a common finding. However, less than 25% of DCIS tumors actually progress into invasive breast cancer, resulting in overtreatment. This overtreatment is due to a lack of predictive precursors to assess aggressiveness and development of DCIS. We hypothesize that tissue oxygenation and perfusion measured by photoacoustic and contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging, respectively, can predict DCIS aggressiveness. To test this, 20 FVB/NJ and 20 SV40Tag mice that genetically develop DCIS-like breast cancers were divided evenly into exercise and control groups and imaged over the course of 6 weeks. Tissue oxygenation was a predictive precursor to invasive breast cancer for FVB/NJ mice (P = 0.015) in the early stages of tumor development. Meanwhile, perfusion results were inconclusive (P > 0.2) as a marker for disease progression. Moreover, voluntary physical exercise resulted in lower weekly tumor growth and significantly improved median survival (P = 0.014).

Treatment is mostly supportive and after a few weeks, most of patients' electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiographic findings will be normalized, though to its benign course, TS can cause some complications. Intra-myocardial dissection and LV apical aneurysm, as a complication of TS has never been reported yet and was just announced in rare cases of MI.||||Our patient was a 32-year-old aphasic woman referring with palpitation and chest discomfort. Further examinations after exclusion of MI revealed TS leading to LV apical aneurysm and intra-myocardial dissection.||||Intra-myocardial dissection should be considered as one of the rarest TS complications. Several studies are necessary for defining the exact pathophysiological mechanisms.

Is There An Overlap Between Eating Disorders and Neurodevelopmental Disorders in Children with Obesity?tThis study aimed at assessing the prevalence of eating disorders (EDs) and ED symptomatology in children with obesity, and at investigating whether EDs occur more often among individuals with a comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Seventy-six children (37 girls, 39 boys, age 5-16 years) were recruited at an outpatient obesity clinic. The adolescents completed ED instruments including The Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and The Eating Disorder Inventory for children (EDI-C). The parents of all participants were interviewed regarding the child's psychiatric morbidity. Diagnoses of ADHD and ASD were collected from medical records. Anthropometric data were compiled. Eight participants (11%) fulfilled the criteria for a probable ED and 16 participants (21%) had ADHD and/or ASD. Two adolescent girls had a probable ED and coexistent ADHD and ASD. No other overlaps between EDs and ADHD/ASD were observed. Loss of control (LOC) eating was present in 26 out of 40 (65%) adolescents, seven of whom had ADHD, ASD or both. LOC eating was not overrepresented among teenagers with ADHD and/or ASD. Weight and shape concerns were on a par with age-matched adolescents with EDs. EDs and ED behavior are more common among children/adolescents with obesity than in the general population. There is no substantial overlap between EDs and ADHD/ASD in adolescents with obesity.

Trends in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy and related combination therapies.tHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver cancer with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Systemic treatments with several multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib and cabozantinib, have been widely utilized int the treatment of HCC. However, with tolerable adverse events and relative low survival time, neo or optimized therapies for advanced HCC are still urgently needed. New developed immune checkpoint inhibitors therapy have been first demonstrated effective in metastatic melanoma through against CTLA-4 or PD-1/PD-L1 to renew T cell effector function. Preclinical data indicated that interference with immune checkpoint molecules results in HCC growth suppression, suggesting it may bring hope to the HCC treatment. Several clinical trials applying monoclonal antibodies to immune checkpoint molecules demonstrated that immune checkpoint inhibitors are safe and enable durable antitumor activity in advanced HCC patients. Several published immunotherapy trials in HCC using Anti-CTLA-4 agents (tremelimumab) or anit-PD-1 agents (Nivolumab) have showed promising results, in which have similar response rate (15%-30%) and disease control rate with TKIs therapies. This article will review the on-going clinical trials associated with immune checkpoint molecules monotherapy or co, and then discuss the optimal scheme of immune checkpoint therapy for advanced HCC.

Oncogenic osteomalacia and metastatic breast cancer: a case report and review of the literature.tOncogenic osteomalacia is a rare paraneoplastic metabolic syndrome that is characterised by severe hypophosphataemia, hyperphosphaturia and osteomalacia secondary to renal loss of phosphate. It is commonly caused by overproduction of fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) from benign tumours of mesenchymal origin. Currently, there is no clear evidence on the management of oncogenic osteomalacia in patients with metastatic solid tumours.||||We report a case of breast cancer-induced oncogenic osteomalacia and discuss its diagnosis and management.||||A 71-year-old woman with advanced breast cancer developed symptomatic oncogenic osteomalacia with raised FGF23, severe hypophosphataemia and hypocalcaemia. The electrolytic disturbances were exacerbated after the administration of bisphosphonates in the context of her oncological treatment. Systemic chemotherapy and maintenance endocrine treatment along with phosphate and calcium supplementation reduced the activity of oncogenic osteomalacia and resolved the electrolytic imbalances.||||To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of oncogenic osteomalacia in a patient with breast cancer. Oncogenic osteomalacia constitutes a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Pre-clinical and clinical evidence suggest that a possible underlying mechanism is the presence of molecular alterations in the FGF/FGFR signalling pathway leading to overexpression of FGF23. In metastatic setting, anticancer treatment can potentially lead to the normalisation of the electrolytic disturbances and reduction of the activity of oncogenic osteomalacia. The use of antiresorptive therapy in patients with bone metastases can potentially trigger FGF23 overexpression. Its use should be guided by the patients' risk of skeletal-related events and electrolytic disturbances as well as the degree of activity of oncogenic osteomalacia.

Identification of ROBO1/2 and SCEL as candidate genes in Kallmann syndrome with emerging bioinformatic analysis.tKallmann syndrome (KS) is a congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism that coincides with anosmia or hyposmia. Although this rare genetic disease has a very low incidence, it harbors a complicated genetic heterogeneity, which indicates X-linked, autosomal, and oligogenic inheritance of puberty, sexuality, reproductivity, and olfactory defects. There has been limited elucidation of molecular etiologies completed to date. Here, a chromosome reciprocal translocation (46, XX, t (3; 13) (p13; q22)) was identified in a 27-year-old Chinese female diagnosed with KS. Genome sequencing found an intronic breakpoint of SCEL in chromosome 13 and an intergenic breakpoint between ROBO1 and ROBO2 in chromosome 3. This translocation resulted in the reduced expression levels of these genes. An array-CGH test captured no abnormal genomic copy numbers of clinical significance. The basic features of all known KS-related genes were also reviewed and analyzed for their roles in KS onset with bioinformatic methods. Signal pathway and gene enrichment analysis of KS-related genes suggested that these genes have integrated functions in neuronal migration and differentiation. An interesting chromosome locational pattern of KS-related genes was also discovered. This study provided constructive clues for further investigations into the molecular etiology of KS.

Improvement of spinal muscular atrophy via correction of the SMN2 splicing defect by Brucea javanica (L.) Merr. extract and Bruceine D.tSpinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare neuromuscular disease and a leading genetic cause of infant mortality. SMA is caused primarily by the deletion of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which leaves the duplicate gene SMN2 as the sole source of SMN protein. The splicing defect (exon 7 skipping) of SMN2 leads to an insufficient amount of SMN protein. Therefore, correcting this SMN2 splicing defect is considered to be a promising approach for the treatment of SMA.||||This study aimed to identify active compounds and extracts from plant resources to rescue SMA phenotypes through the correction of SMN2 splicing.||||Of available plant resources, candidates with SMA-related traditional medicine information were selected for screening using a robust luciferase-based SMN2 splicing reporter. Primary hits were further evaluated for their ability to correct the splicing defect and resultant increase of SMN activity in SMA patient-derived fibroblasts. Confirmed hits were finally tested to determine the beneficial effects on the severe Δ7 SMA mouse.||||SMN2 splicing was analyzed using a luciferase-based SMN2 splicing reporter and subsequent RT-PCR of SMN2 mRNAs. SMA phenotypes were evaluated by the survival, body weights, and righting reflex of Δ7 SMA mice.||||In a screen of 492 selected plant extracts, we found that Brucea javanica extract and its major constituent Bruceine D have SMN2 splicing-correcting activity. Their ability to correct the splicing defect and the resulting increased SMN activity were further confirmed in SMA fibroblasts. Importantly, both B. javanica and Bruceine D noticeably improved the phenotypic defects, especially muscle function, in SMA mice. Reduced expression of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) contributed to the correction of splicing by B. javanica.||||Our work revealed that B. javanica and Bruceine D correct the SMN2 splicing defect and improve the symptoms of SMA in mice. These resources will provide another possibility for development of a plant-derived SMA drug candidate.

We used 3D images to evaluate nasal base morphology.||||Consecutive patients undergoing cleft lip repair and foundation-based rhinoplasty were included (N=102). 3D images pre-op, post-op, and at 5 years of age were assessed and compared to age-matched controls. Images were normalized to standard horizontal, cranio-caudal, and antero-posterior axes.||||Cleft subalare was similar in position relative to controls but was 1.6 mm retrodisplaced. Subnasale was deviated 4.6 mm lateral to midline and had the greatest displacement of any landmark. Non-cleft subalare was 2.3 mm laterally displaced. Regression analysis with deviation of subnasale from midline as dependent variable revealed progressive lateral displacement of non-cleft subalare, narrowing of non-cleft nostril, and intercanthal widening. Surgery corrected nasal base displacements along all axes resulting in landmark positions similar to controls. The symmetry of nasal base correction persisted at 5-year follow-up with no recurrent cleft alar base retrusion, regardless of initial cleft type.||||Unilateral cleft lip nasal deformity may be 'driven' by displacement of anterior nasal spine and caudal septum.

Monitoring Progression of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ Using Photoacoustics and Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound.tBreast cancer is the leading form of cancer in women, accounting for approximately 41,400 deaths in 2018. While a variety of risk factors have been identified, physical exercise has been linked to reducing both the risk and aggressiveness of breast cancer. Within breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a common finding. However, less than 25% of DCIS tumors actually progress into invasive breast cancer, resulting in overtreatment. This overtreatment is due to a lack of predictive precursors to assess aggressiveness and development of DCIS. We hypothesize that tissue oxygenation and perfusion measured by photoacoustic and contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging, respectively, can predict DCIS aggressiveness. To test this, 20 FVB/NJ and 20 SV40Tag mice that genetically develop DCIS-like breast cancers were divided evenly into exercise and control groups and imaged over the course of 6 weeks. Tissue oxygenation was a predictive precursor to invasive breast cancer for FVB/NJ mice (P = 0.015) in the early stages of tumor development. Meanwhile, perfusion results were inconclusive (P > 0.2) as a marker for disease progression. Moreover, voluntary physical exercise resulted in lower weekly tumor growth and significantly improved median survival (P = 0.014).

In recent years, increasing evidence has shown that long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) in human cancer and that they are involved in many biological processes, including proliferation, migration, apoptosis and invasion. In the present study, the biological function and molecular mechanism of ataxin 8 opposite strand (ATXN8OS) in BC tissue and cell lines were investigated. It was found that ATXN8OS was markedly up‑regulated in BC tissue and cell lines, and that its level of overexpression was inversely linked with the overall survival rate of patients with BC. Knockdown of ATXN8OS inhibited proliferation, viability and invasion in the human MCF7 and MDA‑MB‑231 BC cell lines. In addition, microRNA‑204 (miR‑204) was negatively associated with the expression of ATXN8OS in BC tissues and cell lines. A luciferase assay demonstrated a direct binding site for miR‑204 within ATXN8OS, and inhibition of miR‑204 stimulated the tumour‑promoting effect of ATXN8OS on BC cells. In conclusion, the present study suggested that ATXN8OS acts as a tumour promoter by sequestering miR‑204 during the development of BC, therefore providing a mechanistic insight which may facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of BC.

Recent studies have also shown its efficacy against refractory seizures in TSC. We investigated the efficacy of everolimus in nine patients with TSC, who were admitted to the TSC clinic in Seirei Hamamatsu General Hospital and who suffered from refractory seizures. At the start of treatment, patients ranged from 1 month to 23 years of age, and were refractory to a mean of 5.4 antiepileptic agents. Main seizures were focal in six patients and generalized in three patients. After 0.5 to 4.0 years (mean=2.4 years), three patients (33%) were seizure-free and two patients (22%) experienced >90% reduction in seizures. Everolimus may therefore be effective in the treatment of refractory seizures in TSC. (Received February 20, 2019; Accepted April 2, 2019; Published June 1, 2019).

The present study also provides a review of relevant previously published studies. A boy with MIC‑CAP syndrome with developmental delay, intractable epilepsy and prominent dyskinesia was examined. A pathogenic mutation was identified by whole‑exome sequencing, and the protein structure and function affected by this mutation were predicted using bioinformatics analysis. Finally, the clinical features of 16 other cases reported in previous studies were reviewed and compared. A novel compound heterozygous mutation of the STAMBP (c.1119‑1G>T, c.968A>G) was identified in the present study and epilepsy was refractory, consistent with previously reported cases. The present study also highlighted the fact that STAMBP mutation‑associated MIC‑CAP often presents as intractable early‑life epilepsy, which may lead to mortality.

Its cardiac manifestations are non-specific, leading to delayed diagnosis and poor prognosis. However, chemotherapy could improve survival, which makes early and prompt diagnosis very crucial. This is a report of a rare case of PCL found on a 73-year-old man who benefit from early debulking surgery.||||A 73-year-old man presented with worsening dyspnoea over the last 2 months. A 7.2 × 10.2 cm intramural tumour was found extending from the right atrium to the right ventricle. It was considered that the tumour could cause sudden death due to its size and extension. Therefore, surgical debulking with biopsy and valve repair was done. Cytology examination from the resected specimen demonstrated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma non-germinal centre B-cell like type. He was discharged 2 weeks after the surgery in stable condition and referred to internal medicine department for chemotherapy. However, he chose palliative home care and died 44 days after surgery.||||In cases of PCL with concerning tumour size and symptoms due to cardiac obstruction, early surgical debulking could improve haemodynamics, prevent sudden death, and confirm immunopathological diagnosis needed in determining further chemotherapy, which is proven to improve survival.

New Therapies for the Treatment of Renal Fibrosis.tRenal fibrosis is the common pathway for progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end stage of renal disease. It is now widely accepted that the degree of renal fibrosis correlates with kidney function and CKD stages. The key cellular basis of renal fibrosis includes activation of myofibroblasts, excessive production of extracellular matrix components, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Many cellular mechanisms responsible for renal fibrosis have been identified, and some antifibrotic agents show a greater promise in slowing down and even reversing fibrosis in animal models; however, translating basic findings into effective antifibrotic therapies in human has been limited. In this chapter, we will discuss the effects and mechanisms of some novel antifibrotic agents in both preclinical studies and clinical trials.

Risk of Head and Neck Cancer in Patients With Prior Hematologic Malignant Tumors.tMore than 1.3 million people in the United States have a hematologic malignant tumor currently or in remission. Previous studies have demonstrated an increased risk of secondary neoplasms in patients with hematologic malignant tumors, but research specifically on the risk of head and neck solid tumors in patients with prior hematologic malignant tumors is limited.||||To examine a possible association between prior hematologic malignant tumors and risk of head and neck cancer and to assess the overall survival (OS) among these patients.||||This retrospective analysis used the Veterans Affairs (VA) Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) to identify patients with diagnoses of hematologic malignant tumors and head and neck cancers. All patients in the VA CDW with a birthdate between January 1, 1910, and December 31, 1969, were included, for a cohort of 30 939 656 veterans. Data analysis was performed from August 15, 2018, to January 31, 2019.||||Outpatient problem lists were queried for diagnoses of hematologic malignant tumor and associated malignant tumors using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes to categorize patients by history of hematologic malignant tumors.||||Presence of head and neck cancer was determined from ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes of outpatient problem lists, and cancers were grouped by subsite. The OS was determined from date of death or last outpatient visit date.||||Of 30 939 656 patients (27 636 683 [89.3%] male; 13 971 259 [45.2%] white), 207 322 patients had a hematologic malignant tumor, of whom 1353 were later diagnosed with head and neck cancer. A history of hematologic malignant tumors was significantly associated with overall aerodigestive tract cancer, with a relative risk (RR) of 1.6 (95% CI, 1.5-1.7), as well as oral cavity (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5-1.9), oropharynx (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5-1.9), larynx (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.5), nasopharynx (RR, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.1-3.9), sinonasal (RR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.2-4.1), salivary gland (RR, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.4-3.3), and thyroid (RR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.9-2.4) tumors on subsite analysis. A prior hematologic malignant tumor was also negatively associated with 2-year and 5-year OS for multiple subsites.||||A prior diagnosis of hematologic or associated malignant tumors was associated with an increased risk of solid head and neck cancers in a range of subsites. In addition, for several head and neck cancer subsites, patients with prior hematologic malignant tumors had worse 2-year and 5-year OS. These results indicate that a prior hematologic malignant tumor may be an adverse risk factor in the development and progression of head and neck cancer.

Association between Autism Spectrum Disorder and Caregiver-Reported Dental Caries in Children.tThere is evidence that dental caries is both increased and decreased in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).||||This study examined the association between ASD and the probability of a child having caregiver-reported dental caries based on a nationally representative sample. We hypothesized that when compared with children without ASD, children with ASD would have greater odds of dental caries.||||We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health. Caregivers reported whether a health provider informed them that their children had ASD and "decayed teeth or cavities" during the past 12 mo. We used logistic regression controlling for child characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance, preventive dental use) and family characteristics (education and federal poverty level).||||Among the 45,155 children in our sample, 1,228 (2.5%) had ASD. The prevalence of caregiver-reported dental caries was 14.7% in children with ASD and 9.5% in children without ASD. The odds of having caregiver-reported child dental caries (adjusted odds ratio = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.2 to 1.7) was greater among children with ASD than children without ASD when controlling for the aforementioned covariates.||||Using a nationally representative sample, we found that children with ASD had significantly greater odds of having caregiver-reported dental caries as compared with children without ASD. Families can be educated on the increased odds of having dental caries in children with ASD. Moreover, this finding highlights a need for oral health services and policies to prevent and treat dental caries, which are tailored to the increasing number of American children with ASD.||||The results of this study support the need for policy makers, clinicians, and families to improve oral health services that prevent and treat dental caries in the increasing number of American children with autism spectrum disorder.

Deletion of Fmr1 from Forebrain Excitatory Neurons Triggers Abnormal Cellular, EEG, and Behavioral Phenotypes in the Auditory Cortex of a Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome.tFragile X syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of autism with symptoms that include sensory processing deficits. In both humans with FXS and a mouse model [Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse], electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings show enhanced resting state gamma power and reduced sound-evoked gamma synchrony. We previously showed that elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) may contribute to these phenotypes by affecting perineuronal nets (PNNs) around parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice. However, how different cell types within local cortical circuits contribute to these deficits is not known. Here, we examined whether Fmr1 deletion in forebrain excitatory neurons affects neural oscillations, MMP-9 activity, and PV/PNN expression in the auditory cortex. We found that cortical MMP-9 gelatinase activity, mTOR/Akt phosphorylation, and resting EEG gamma power were enhanced in CreNex1/Fmr1Flox/y conditional KO (cKO) mice, whereas the density of PV/PNN cells was reduced. The CreNex1/Fmr1Flox/y cKO mice also show increased locomotor activity, but not the anxiety-like behaviors. These results indicate that fragile X mental retardation protein changes in excitatory neurons in the cortex are sufficient to elicit cellular, electrophysiological, and behavioral phenotypes in Fmr1 KO mice. More broadly, these results indicate that local cortical circuit abnormalities contribute to sensory processing deficits in autism spectrum disorders.

A nationwide genetic analysis of inherited retinal diseases in Israel as assessed by the Israeli inherited retinal disease consortium (IIRDC).tInherited retinal diseases (IRDs) cause visual loss due to dysfunction or progressive degeneration of photoreceptors. These diseases show marked phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. The Israeli IRD consortium (IIRDC) was established in 2013 with the goal of performing clinical and genetic mapping of the majority of Israeli IRD patients. To date, we recruited 2,420 families including 3,413 individuals with IRDs. On the basis of our estimation, these patients represent approximately 40% of Israeli IRD patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is, by far, the largest reported IRD cohort, and one of the first studies addressing the genetic analysis of IRD patients on a nationwide scale. The most common inheritance pattern in our cohort is autosomal recessive (60% of families). The most common retinal phenotype is retinitis pigmentosa (43%), followed by Stargardt disease and cone/cone-rod dystrophy. We identified the cause of disease in 56% of the families. Overall, 605 distinct mutations were identified, of which 12% represent prevalent founder mutations. The most frequently mutated genes were ABCA4, USH2A, FAM161A, CNGA3, and EYS. The results of this study have important implications for molecular diagnosis, genetic screening, and counseling, as well as for the development of new therapeutic strategies for retinal diseases.

Tumor angiogenesis is a vital part in cancer, which influences cell proliferation and metastasis. Increasing studies have claimed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were involved in the progression of several cancers. Based on previous studies, this study focused on the role and mechanism of lncRNA MCM3AP antisense RNA 1 (MCM3AP-AS1) in lung cancer. At first, MCM3AP-AS1 expression was found to be elevated in lung cancer cells. Depletion of MCM3AP-AS1 repressed cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis in lung cancer cells. YY1 was confirmed to mediate MCM3AP-AS1 transcription in lung cancer cells. Moreover, the molecular mechanism investigation revealed that MCM3AP-AS1 could sponge miR-340-5p and elevate KPNA4 expression. On the basis of rescue assays, we identified that the overexpression of KPNA4 partly counteracted the suppressed effect of MCM3AP-AS1 knockdown on angiogenesis and progression in lung cancer cells. Conclusively, the YY1-mediated overexpression of MCM3AP-AS1 accelerated angiogenesis and progression in lung cancer by targeting miR-340-5p/KPNA4 axis, which highlighted the possibility of MCM3AP-AS1 as a promising therapeutic target for lung cancer.

Serum calcium levels are routinely monitored using total calcium measurements corrected for albumin. However, myeloma-related paraproteins may bind calcium, confounding these measurements.||||We retrospectively analyzed correlation between corrected calcium and ionized calcium in a sample of patients with MM and a control sample of patients with breast or non-small cell lung cancers (n = 200). Multiple linear regression was used to identify variables affecting corrected calcium measurements.||||Correlation between corrected calcium and ionized calcium was stronger in the control group compared to the MM group (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.85 versus 0.76, respectively). Sensitivity of corrected calcium in identifying hypercalcemia defined by elevated ionized calcium was 36% in patients with MM and 76% in the control group. Multiple linear regression did not reveal variables significantly influencing corrected calcium in the MM group, although serum paraprotein trended toward significance (p = 0.09).||||Ionized calcium may be better than corrected calcium for detecting hypercalcemia in patients with MM. Additional analyses are needed to better quantify the clinical impact of paraprotein calcium-binding.

Clinical outcome is compounded by resistance to standard and novel therapeutics. We have evaluated reformulated aspirin (IP1867B) alone and in combination with conventional and novel anti-aHGG agents. We show that recent biopsy-derived aHGG models were highly resistant to conventional therapeutics although show sensitivity to IP1867B, a reformulated "liquid" aspirin. IP1867B treatment mediated a potent suppression of the IL6/STAT3 and NF-κB pathways and observed a significant reduction in EGFR transcription and protein expression. We observed the loss of the insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor expression at both the transcript and protein level post IP1867B treatment. This increased sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors. In vivo, IP1867B was very well tolerated, had little-to-no gastric lesions versus aspirin and, directed a significant reduction of tumour burden with suppression of EGFR, IGF1 and IGFR1. With EGFR inhibitors, we noted a potent synergistic response in aHGG cells. These data provide a rationale for further investigation of IP1867B with a number of anti-EGFR agents currently being evaluated in the clinic.

Relevance of Neurotrophin Receptors CD271 and TrkC for Prognosis, Migration, and Proliferation in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.tHead and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and often has a poor prognosis. The present study investigated the role of the low affinity nerve growth factor receptor CD271 as a putative therapy target in HNSCC. Neurotrophins that bind to CD271 also have a high affinity for the tropomyosin receptor kinase family (Trk), consisting of TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC, which must also be considered in addition to CD271. A retrospective study and functional in vitro cell line tests (migration assay and cell sorting) were conducted in order to evaluate the relevance of CD271 expression alone and with regard to Trk expression. CD271 and Trks were heterogeneously expressed in human HNSCC. The vast majority of tumors exhibited CD271 and TrkA, whereas only half of the tumors expressed TrkB and TrkC. High expression of CD271-positive cells predicted a bad clinical outcome of patients with HNSCC and was associated with distant metastases. However, the human carcinomas that also expressed TrkC had a reduced correlation with distant metastases and better survival rates. In vitro, CD271 expression marked a subpopulation with higher proliferation rates, but proliferation was lower in tumor cells that co-expressed CD271 and TrkC. The CD271 inhibitor LM11A 31 suppressed cell motility in vitro. However, neither TrkA nor TrkB expression were linked to prognosis or cell proliferation. We conclude that CD271 is a promising candidate that provides prognostic information for HNSCC and could be a putative target for HNSCC treatment.

Reduced structural connectivity in Insomnia Disorder.tInsomnia Disorder is the most prevalent sleep disorder, and it involves both sleep difficulties and daytime complaints. The neural underpinnings of Insomnia Disorder are poorly understood. Several existing neuroimaging studies focused on local measures and specific regions of interests, which makes it difficult to judge their whole-brain significance. We therefore here applied a data-driven approach to assess differences in whole-brain structural connectivity between adults with Insomnia Disorder and matched controls without sleep complaints. We used diffusion tensor imaging and probabilistic tractography to assess whole-brain structural connectivity, and examined group differences using network-based statistics. The results revealed a significant difference in the structural connectivity of the two groups (p = .014). Participants with Insomnia Disorder showed reduced connectivity in a sub-network that included mainly fronto-subcortical connections with the insula as a key region. By taking a whole-brain network perspective, our study enables the integration of previous inconsistent findings. Our results reveal that reduced structural connectivity of the left insula and the connections between frontal and subcortical regions are central neurobiological features of Insomnia Disorder. The importance of these areas for interoception, emotional processing, stress responses and the generation of slow-wave sleep may help guide the development of neurobiology-based models of the prevalent condition of Insomnia Disorder.

This study aims to examine whether the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the increased expression of glucose transporters (GLUTs) and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) influences the cataract development in DM.||||˙¯ production in the LECs was determined in vivo with dihydroethidium stainings.||||We investigated that GLUT levels in LECs differed significantly, thus leading to the direct enhancement of RAGE-associated superoxide generation in DM patients with cataracts. Superoxide production was significantly higher in LECs from rats with fructose-induced type 2 DM, whereas treatment with the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin prevented this effect in fructose-fed rats. Protein expression levels of the sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), GLUT1, GLUT5, the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced form (NADPH) oxidase subunit p67-phox, NOX2/4 and RAGE were upregulated in fructose-fed animals, whereas dapagliflozin treatment reversed these effects.||||In rats with fructose-induced DM, dapagliflozin downregulates RAGE-induced NADPH oxidase expression in LECs via the inactivation of GLUTs and a reduction in ROS generation. These novel findings suggest that the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin may be a candidate for the pharmacological prevention of cataracts in patients with DM.

Breast metastases: A rare manifestation of advanced uterine serous carcinoma.tMetastasis of non-mammary tumors to the breast are uncommon, representing <1% of all breast tumors. Breast metastasis are associated with advanced disease and poor prognosis regardless of the origin of the primary tumor. Uterine cancer metastasis to the breast is an extremely rare finding and has not been reported in the case of serous histology. Here, we review two cases of uterine serous carcinoma metastatic to the breast. Both patients presented with breast-specific complaints including pain and palpable mass and were found to have widely metastatic disease. Tissue biopsy and immunohistochemistry consistent with primary uterine serous carcinoma confirmed the diagnosis of metastasis in both cases. Our findings suggest hematogenous metastasis to the breast is a late phenomenon in the course of endometrial carcinoma and associated with the development of disease at multiple sites. This emphasizes the importance of complete evaluation in patients presenting with breast complaints and known history of malignancy, as this may be the only presenting symptoms in patients with widely metastatic disease.

All subjects had typical biochemical features of HPP (low ALP, high serum pyridoxal-5'-phosphate), except the heterozygous sibling (normal ALP). Functional assay: Mutants 1 and 2 demonstrated negligible ALP activity and mineralization was 7.9% and 9.3% of WT, respectively. Mutant 3 demonstrated about 50% ALP activity and 15.5% mineralization of WT. On Western blot analysis, mutants 1 and 2 were detected as faint bands indicating reduced expression and mutant 3 was expressed as mature form protein with 50% of WT expression. Mutant 1 was located near the Glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, 2 at the core structure of the ALP protein and 3 at the periphery of the protein structure. Co-transfection did not reveal a dominant negative effect in any of the mutants.||||Our findings expand the current knowledge of functional effect of individual mutations and the importance of their location in the ALP structure.

The functional deregulations of global transcriptome were associated with the genesis and development of HCC, but lacks systematic research and validation.||||A total of 519 postoperative HCC patients were included. We built an interactive and visual competing endogenous RNA network. The prognostic signature was established with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to screen for independent prognostic factors for HCC overall survival.||||In the training set, we identified a four-gene signature (PBK, CBX2, CLSPN, and CPEB3) and effectively predicted the overall survival. The survival times of patients in the high-score group were worse than those in the low-score group (p = 0.0004), and death was also more likely in the high-score group (HR 2.444, p < 0.001). The results were validated in internal validation set (p = 0.0057) and two external validation cohorts (HR 2.467 and 2.6). The signature (AUCs of 1, 2, 3 years were 0.716, 0.726, 0.714, respectively) showed high prognostic accuracy in the complete TCGA cohort.||||In conclusion, we successfully built a more extensive ceRNA network for HCC and then identified a four-gene-based signature, enabling prediction of the overall survival of patients with HCC.

Arrhythmogenic Inflammatory Cardiomyopathy in Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases: A Challenge for Cardio-Rheumatology.tVentricular arrhythmia (VA) in autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD) is an expression of autoimmune inflammatory cardiomyopathy (AIC), caused by structural, electrical, or inflammatory heart disease, and has a serious impact on a patient's outcome. Myocardial scar of ischemic or nonischemic origin through a re-entry mechanism facilitates the development of VA. Additionally, autoimmune myocardial inflammation, either isolated or as a part of the generalized inflammatory process, also facilitates the development of VA through arrhythmogenic autoantibodies and inflammatory channelopathies. The clinical presentation of AIC varies from oligo-asymptomatic presentation to severe VA and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Both positron emission tomography (PET) and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can diagnose AIC early and be useful tools for the assessment of therapies during follow-ups. The AIC treatment should be focused on the following: (1) early initiation of cardiac medication, including ACE-inhibitors, b-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists; (2) early initiation of antirheumatic medication, depending on the underlying disease; and (3) potentially implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and/or ablation therapy in patients who are at high risk for SCD.

Molecular correlates of cerebellar mutism syndrome in medulloblastoma.tCerebellar Mutism Syndrome (CMS) is a common complication following resection of posterior fossa tumors, most commonly after surgery for medulloblastoma. Medulloblastoma subgroups have historically been treated as a single entity when assessing CMS risk; however, recent studies highlighting their clinical heterogeneity suggest the need for subgroup-specific analysis. Here, we examine a large international multicenter cohort of molecularly characterized medulloblastoma patients to assess predictors of CMS.||||We assembled a cohort of 370 molecularly characterized medulloblastoma subjects with available neuroimaging from five sites globally including Great Ormond Street Hospital, Christian Medical College and Hospital, Hospital for Sick Children, King Hussein Cancer Center, and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. Age at diagnosis, sex, tumour volume, and CMS development were assessed in addition to molecular subgroup.||||Overall, 23.8% of patients developed CMS. CMS patients were younger (mean difference -2.05 years ± 0.50, P=0.0218) and had larger tumours (mean difference 10.25 cm3 ± 4.60, P=0.0010) that were more often midline (OR=5.72, P<0.0001). In a multivariable analysis adjusting for age, sex, midline location, and tumour volume, WNT (Wingless) (adjusted OR=4.91, p=0.0063), Group 3 (adjusted OR=5.56, p=0.0022) and Group 4 (adjusted OR=8.57 p=9.1x10-5) tumours were found to be independently associated with higher risk of CMS compared with SHH (Sonic Hedgehog) tumours.||||Medulloblastoma subgroup is a very strong predictor of CMS development, independent of tumour volume and midline location. These findings have significant implications for management of both the tumour and CMS.

Pelvic Aggressive Angiomyxoma: Major Challenges in Diagnosis and Treatment.tAggressive pelvic angiomyxoma is a very rare mesenchymal tumor that is usually diagnosed in premenopausal female patients. The current mainly reported treatment is wide surgical excision. Other treatment options, such as radiotherapy and hormonal therapy, have been suggested as potential alternatives. A 61-year-old postmenopausal female patient presented with hematuria that led to the identification of a perirectal mass on abdominopelvic imaging. A 46-year-old female patient presented with a perineal mass of unknown etiology. Despite extensive investigations, the diagnosis could not be confirmed before surgical resection in both patients. Surgical excisions were performed and revealed the presence of an aggressive angiomyxoma with positive estrogen and progesterone tumoral receptors in both cases. Radiological and clinical recurrence was noted in one patient. Tumor regression was noted in this patient after treatment with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist with long-term remission. The diagnosis of a perirectal aggressive angiomyxoma is an exceedingly rare event. Preoperative biopsy and pathological diagnosis are challenging and often yields poor results. Its slow growth and expression of hormonal receptors make noninvasive therapeutic strategies, such as radiotherapy, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, or even watchful waiting, valid options in selected patients. Due to the lack of reported cases, the best treatment has yet to be elucidated.

Olfactory dysfunction in patients undergoing supraorbital keyhole craniotomy for clipping of unruptured aneurysms.tOlfactory performance has rarely been assessed in the perioperative phase of elective aneurysm surgery. Here, we assessed the risk for olfactory deterioration following surgical treatment of unruptured cerebral aneurysm via the supraorbital keyhole craniotomy. A retrospective review of patients with electively treated cerebral aneurysms who underwent perioperative assessment of olfactory function using a sniffin' sticks odor identification test between January 2015 and January 2016 was performed. A subgroup of patients without history of subarachnoid hemorrhage, without prior aneurysm treatment, and confirmed olfactory function underwent supraorbital keyhole craniotomy for aneurysm clipping. Microscopic and endoscopic videos were reviewed for this subgroup. Sixty-four patients who underwent elective aneurysm treatment either via surgical clipping or endovascular aneurysm obliteration were identified. Prior to treatment, 4/64 (6.3%) demonstrated bilateral anosmia. Collectively, 14 patients (21.9%) met subgroup criteria of supraorbital keyhole craniotomy for aneurysm clipping. Here, olfactory performance significantly decreased postoperatively on the side of craniotomy (ipsilateral, P = 0.007), whereas contralateral and bilateral olfactory function remained unaltered (P = 0.301 and P = 0.582, respectively). Consequently, 4/14 patients (28.6%) demonstrated ipsilateral anosmia 3 months after surgery. One patient (1/14, 7.1%) also experienced contralateral anosmia resulting in bilateral anosmia. Intraoperative visualization of the olfactory tract and surgical maneuvers do not facilitate prediction of olfactory outcome. The supraorbital keyhole craniotomy harbors a specific risk for unilateral olfactory deterioration. Lack of perioperative olfactory assessment likely results in underestimation of the risk for olfactory decline. Despite uneventful surgery, prediction of postoperative olfactory function and dysfunction remain challenging. Clin. Anat., 2019. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Prolonged Post-surgical Drain Retention Increases Risk for Deep Wound Infection After Spine Surgery.tSurgical site infections (SSIs) complicate 1% to 9% of elective spine surgeries. Previously identified risk factors include diabetes mellitus type 2, obesity, and chronic kidney disease. We sought to determine whether the use of postoperative surgical site drains is associated with deep SSIs.||||We retrospectively identified patients operated for deep SSIs after surgery for degenerative spine pathologies between July 2016 and December 2018. Patients were excluded if the reason for operation was other than deep SSI or if their primary operation was for infection or tumor. Using their index procedure and the electronic medical record, patients were matched to controls based on age, surgical invasiveness, International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification code, race, and sex. Our main outcome of interest was whether drain retention time, total output, or daily output differed significantly between cases and controls.||||; P = 0.001), higher odds of having diabetes mellitus type 2 (55.3% vs. 18.4%; P = 0.002), longer drain retention time (5.5 vs. 3.5 days; P = 0.02), and longer inpatient stay (9.5 vs. 4.3 days; P = 0.005). Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that even after controlling for the other risk factors, drain retention time independently predicted postoperative surgical site infection (odds ratio: 1.36; P = 0.02).||||Prolonged surgical drain retention correlates with risk of deep SSI after surgery for degenerative spine disease independent of surgical invasiveness, diabetes mellitus type 2 status, and total drain output. Our data suggest early postoperative drain removal may potentially decrease the risk of SSI and shorten duration of hospital stay.

Chagas Disease and Heart Failure: An Expanding Issue Worldwide.tChagas disease, originally a South American endemic health problem, is expanding worldwide because of people migration. Its main impact is on the cardiovascular system, producing myocardial damage that frequently results in heart failure. Pathogenic pathways are mainly related to inmunoinflamatory reactions in the myocardium and, less frequently, in the gastrointestinal tract. The heart usually shows fibrosis, producing dilatation and damage of the electrogenic cardiac system. These changes result in cardiomyopathy with heart failure and frequent cardiac arrhythmias and heart blocks. Diagnosis of the disease must include a lab test to detect the parasite or its immune reactions and the usual techniques to evaluate cardiac function. Therapeutic management of Chagas heart failure does not differ significantly from the most common treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy, with special focus on arrhythmias and several degrees of heart block. Heart transplantation is reserved for end-stage cases. Major international scientific organisations are delivering recommendations for prevention and early diagnosis. This article provides an analysis of epidemiology, prevention, treatment and the relationship between Chagas disease and heart failure.

Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials in the prognosis of sudden hearing loss ‒ a systematic review.tSudden hearing loss is an otorhinolaryngological emergency that often leads to severe damage to the auditory and vestibular function. The vestibular evoked myogenic potential is a test that allows a noninvasive evaluation of the otolithic system function and vestibulospinal and vestibulo-ocular pathways.||||To evaluate the importance of vestibular evoked myogenic potential in determining the prognosis of patients with sudden hearing loss.||||A search for articles published up to December 2018 was performed in the PubMed, Cochrane, VHL and LILACS databases using MeSH descriptors. Retrospective and prospective articles were included containing cervical or ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential in sudden hearing loss patients and information on associated vertigo and/or dizziness.||||Sixteen of 62 initially selected articles met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Regarding the methodology of the evaluated studies, 8 studies were prospective, six were retrospective, one contained part of the data from a retrospective analysis and another part from a prospective analysis, and one study was cross-sectional. A total of 872 patients were evaluated (50.22% males and 49.77% females) with a mean age of 51.26 years. Four hundred and twenty-six patients (50.35%) had vertigo and/or dizziness associated with sudden hearing loss. The cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential was performed in all studies, but only seven assessed the ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential. The cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential showed alterations in 38.65% of 846 evaluated ears, whereas ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential showed alterations in 47.88% of 368 evaluated ears. The hearing recovery rate was analyzed by 8 articles, with 63.4% of 410 evaluated ears showing hearing recovery.||||The studies suggest that the assessment of the vestibular system using vestibular evoked myogenic potential seems to be important in the prognosis of sudden hearing loss. For better follow-up of patients with sudden hearing loss, the emphasis should not be limited to the cochlea, but also include the diagnosis and treatment of vestibular abnormalities, regardless of the presence of vertigo.

Full Recovery From Cocaine-Induced Toxic Leukoencephalopathy: Emphasizing the Role of Neuroinflammation and Brain Edema.tToxic leukoencephalopathy (TL) is characterized by white matter disease on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and evidence of exposure to a neurotoxic agent. We describe a case of cocaine-induced TL in which extensive white matter disease did not preclude full recovery. A 57-year-old man with substance abuse disorder presented with a 5-day history of strange behavior. On admission, he was alert but had difficulty concentrating, psychomotor retardation, and diffuse hyperreflexia. Brain MRI revealed confluent subcortical white matter hyperintensities with restricted diffusion in some but not in other areas. Electroencephalography (EEG) showed mild diffuse slowing. Blood tests were normal except for mild hyperammonemia. Urine screen was positive for cocaine and benzodiazepine but quantitative analysis was significant only for cocaine. Prednisone 60-mg qd was initiated on day 4, tapered over a 5-day period, and discontinued on day 9. He was discharged after 3 weeks. Cognitive function returned to normal 2 weeks after discharge. Five months later, neurologic exam and EEG were normal and MRI showed near-100% resolution of white matter lesions. TL has been attributed to white matter ischemia/hypoxia resulting in demyelination/axonal injury. The clinical, EEG, and MRI findings and time course of recovery of our patient suggest that cocaine-induced inflammation/edema resulted in TL but not in ischemic/hypoxic injury. While inflammation/edema may have regressed when cocaine was discontinued, we cannot exclude a role for prednisone in protecting the patient from the ischemic/hypoxic sequelae of inflammation/edema. MRI is indispensable for diagnosing TL but EEG may provide additional useful diagnostic and prognostic information.

Antineoplastic-related cardiovascular toxicity: A systematic review and meta-analysis in Asia.tCancer and heart diseases are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in many countries worldwide. Recent advancement in chemotherapy and targeted therapies has led to an improvement in cancer survival rates, but at a cost of higher cardiac side effects. However, report on antineoplastic-related cardiotoxicities incidence in Asia is lacking.||||We systematically searched multiple databases to identify studies reporting incidence of antineoplastic-related cardiovascular toxicity in Asia published from inception to November 2018. Pre-specified subgroups were performed to explore heterogeneity and study quality assessed and reported according to PRISMA guidelines.||||A total of 61 studies across 11 countries in Asia reported 8 types of cardiovascular toxicities were included. These studies mostly reported on adult populations, and usually examined cardiotoxicities related to anthracycline use. The most frequently reported cardiotoxicities were heart failure, electrocardiogram abnormalities and left ventricular dysfunction. The pooled estimated incidence of cardiotoxicity was 4.27% (95% CI: 3.53-5.07). Subgroup analysis showed higher incidence in middle income countries compared to high income countries.||||Although robust incidence studies are sparse, cardiovascular complications affects approximately one in twenty cancer patients in Asia. This highlights a unique opportunity of cancer patients caring that need cardiologists and oncologist to become familiar with this emerging sub-specialty.

Lung Metastases in Patients with Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer: Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Survival Impact.tThe aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, the clinicopathological variables associated with probability of lung metastases, and the impact of lung metastases on survival outcome in patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer (PC) treated with palliative chemotherapy. A total of 654 patients with stage IV PC who underwent palliative chemotherapy from 2010-2016 were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Possible clinical variables associated with lung metastases and survival outcome were examined by univariate and multivariate analysis. Lung metastases were detected in 15.0% (3.4% with isolated lung metastases and 11.6% with synchronic metastases to lung and other organs). Female gender, poorly differentiated tumor grade, and large primary tumor size were independent risk factor in multivariate analysis. The median overall survival (OS) time was 6.5 months in the entire cohort, while the median OS was 11.8, 6.9, 7.7, 10.1, and 5.0 months for patients with isolated lung, isolated liver, isolated peritoneum, isolated distant lymph nodes, and multiple sites metastases, respectively.

Feline leishmaniosis in Portugal: 3 cases (year 2014).tLeishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum is a zoonotic disease endemic in many countries of America, Asia and Europe, including Portugal. Dogs are the major reservoir of L. infantum, but domestic cats may also be infected. Three clinical cases of feline leishmaniosis are described, with ocular clinical signs as the only manifestation of the disease. A case had bilateral anterior uveitis and a granulomatous conjunctivitis, another one presented keratitis and the third case had a nodular blepharitis. All the affected cats had high serum titres of antibodies to L. infantum, while polymerase chain reaction results were positive in two of the cats. Although all cats in the present study improved after treatment with meglumine antimoniate and/or allopurinol, one of them died 6months later apparently due to a systemic L. infantum infection. The prevalence of disease may be underestimated in cats, because leishmaniosis is often not considered in the differential diagnosis of feline diseases. Feline leishmaniosis should be suspected in cats with ocular clinical signs and in those living in or traveling to areas where the zoonosis is endemic.

Safe Placement of Ommaya Reservoirs in Thrombocytopenic Patients: One Institutions Experience.tObjective The purpose of this study was to assess the risk of hemorrhagic complications in thrombocytopenic patients after Ommaya reservoir placement. Methods Between 2009 and 2017, 192 patients were identified on the National Neoplastic Meningitis Registry and had undergone Ommaya reservoir placement for intrathecal chemotherapy. A retrospective chart review was performed to collect the preoperative and postoperative platelet levels, whether or not the patient received any transfusion of platelets, neurological exams, and whether a postoperative head CT was obtained. Using generally accepted recommendations, a platelet level less than 100,000/μL was considered clinically significant and used as our threshold for thrombocytopenia. Results Seven patients (3.6%) were identified as thrombocytopenic in our patient population with platelet counts ranging from 54,000 to 99,000/μL. Primary diagnoses for the seven patients included leukemia, prostate cancer, primary brain cancer (four patients), and lung cancer (non-small-cell lung carcinoma). One patient received platelet transfusions preoperatively. Three patients had a routine head CT obtained postoperatively with no abnormal findings noted. There were no changes in the neurological exam noted in all of the patients included in this study. No clinically significant hemorrhages were identified in our patients. Conclusions From our single institutional experience, we found that thrombocytopenia is fairly uncommon, found in only 3.6% of our patients undergoing placement of Ommaya reservoirs. We did not encounter any increased risks of postoperative hemorrhage in studied thrombocytopenic patients.

Metabolic requirements of human pro-inflammatory B cells in aging and obesity.tThe subset of pro-inflammatory B cells, called late memory, tissue-like or double negative (DN), accumulates in the blood of elderly individuals. Here we show that DN B cells do not proliferate and do not make antibodies to influenza antigens, but they secrete antibodies with autoimmune reactivity, in agreement with their membrane phenotype (CD95+CD21-CD11c+) and their spontaneous expression of the transcription factor T-bet. These cells also increase in the blood of individuals with obesity and autoimmune diseases, but causative mechanisms and signaling pathways involved are known only in part. In the present paper we compare frequencies and metabolic requirements of these cells in the blood of healthy individuals of different ages and in the blood and the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of individuals with obesity. Results show that DN B cells from young individuals have minimal metabolic requirements, DN B cells from elderly and obese individuals utilize higher amounts of glucose to perform autoimmune antibody production and enroll in aerobic glycolysis to support their function. DN B cells from the SAT have the highest metabolic requirements as they activate oxidative phosphorylation, aerobic glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. DN B cells from the SAT also show the highest levels of ROS and the highest levels of phosphorylated AMPK (5'-AMP activated kinase) and Sestrin 1, both able to mitigate stress and cell death. This metabolic advantage drives DN B cell survival and function (secretion of autoimmune antibodies).

The clinical and genetic characteristics of permanent neonatal diabetes (PNDM) in the state of Qatar.tNeonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is a rare condition that occurs within the first six months of life. Permanent NDM (PNDM) is caused by mutations in specific genes that are known for their expression at early and/or late stages of pancreatic beta- cell development, and are either involved in beta-cell survival, insulin processing, regulation, and release. The native population in Qatar continues to practice consanguineous marriages that lead to a high level of homozygosity. To our knowledge, there is no previous report on the genomics of NDM among the Qatari population. The aims of the current study are to identify patients with NDM diagnosed between 2001 and 2016, and examine their clinical and genetic characteristics.||||To calculate the incidence of PNDM, all patients with PNDM diagnosed between 2001 and 2016 were compared to the total number of live births over the 16-year-period. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) was used to investigate the genetic etiology in the PNDM cohort.||||PNDM was diagnosed in nine (n = 9) patients with an estimated incidence rate of 1:22,938 live births among the indigenous Qatari. Seven different mutations in six genes (PTF1A, GCK, SLC2A2, EIF2AK3, INS, and HNF1B) were identified. In the majority of cases, the genetic etiology was part of a previously identified autosomal recessive disorder. Two novel de novo mutations were identified in INS and HNF1B.||||Qatar has the second highest reported incidence of PNDM worldwide. A majority of PNDM cases present as rare familial autosomal recessive disorders. Pancreas associated transcription factor 1a (PTF1A) enhancer deletions are the most common cause of PNDM in Qatar, with only a few previous cases reported in the literature.

They are benign and originate from an alteration of differentiated mesenchymal and epithelial odontogenic cells. They have the capacity of forming enamel, dentin, and cementum. Etiology in still unknown, but different theories have been postulated. Because these tumors are asymptomatic, 75% of all cases are diagnosed before the second decade of life, due to a delay in eruption of permanent teeth. Treatment of choice for these tumors is enucleation. The authors describe one such case of compound odontome obstructing the eruption of a permanent lateral incisor.

Past failures are the likely result of equating tumour shrinkage to efficacy, rather than inhibition of tumour spread. In the future, the selection of anti-metastasis drug candidates will probably be based on anti-migratory rather than anti-proliferative potential. Oligometastatic cancer coupled with advanced imaging can serve as a clinical proof-of-concept model.

Evolution in medicinal chemistry of sorafenib derivatives for hepatocellular carcinoma.tHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors. Traditional chemotherapy drugs are hard to reach a satisfactory therapeutic effect since advanced HCC is highly chemo-resistant. Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that can suppress tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis and induce cancer cell apoptosis. However, the poor solubility, rapid metabolism and low bioavailability of sorafenib greatly restricted its further clinical application. During the past decade, numerous sorafenib derivatives have been designed and synthesized to overcome its disadvantages and improve its clinical performance. This article focuses on the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of various sorafenib derivatives with modifications on the N-methylpicolinamide group, urea group, central aromatic ring or others. More importantly, this review summarizes the current status of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of reported sorafenib derivatives, which can provide some detailed information of future directions for further structural modifications of sorafenib to discovery new anti-tumor drugs with improved clinical performance.

Cytoreductive Surgery With Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy, Part I: Introduction and Indications.tCytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is used to treat peritoneal carcinomatosis, which often is secondary to gastrointestinal and ovarian cancers. During CRS, the surgeon resects cancerous tumors from the peritoneal cavity. During HIPEC, a chemotherapy agent is introduced into a solution that flows in and out of catheters in the abdominal cavity for approximately 90 minutes. The chemoperfusate is heated to 42° C (107.6° F), which kills cancer cells but is nonthreatening to normal cells. A primary goal of combining CRS with HIPEC is to apply targeted regional chemotherapy directly to the peritoneum to destroy residual micrometastatic disease while the tumor burden is minimal and before cancer cells become entrapped by the body's wound-healing processes. Although HIPEC usually is not curative, it can extend a patient's life expectancy three to five years. This is the first article in a two-part discussion of CRS with HIPEC.

Connexin 26 and Connexin 43 in Canine Mammary Carcinoma.tIncidence of canine mammary carcinoma is two times higher than the rate of human breast cancer. Mammary tumors are the most common type of cancer in intact female dogs and account for about half of all neoplasms in these dogs. Well-established models of breast cancer have shown that neoplastic cells often have a loss of intercellular communication, particularly gap junction proteins. Thus, the objective of this study is to explore the aspect of gap junction intercellular communication in canine mammary carcinoma, non-cancerous (CMEC) and cancerous (CMT12, CMT27, and CF41.Mg) cells, and patient-derived tumors. Both non-cancerous and cancerous mammary cells express connexins 26 and 43 using immunofluorescence; however, the level of expression is significantly different in quantitative analysis using western blot in which connexin 43 in both CMT12 and CMT27 is significantly decreased compared to CMEC. Furthermore, a decrease of gap junction capacity in CMT12 and CMT27 was observed compared to CMEC. Immunostaining of CMT27-xenograft tumors revealed positive Cx26 and negative Cx43 expression. Similarly, immunostaining of spontaneous canine mammary tumors revealed that Cx26 is present in all tumors while Cx43 is present in 25% of tumors. Overall, the study provides for the first time that a differential pattern of connexin expression exists between non-cancerous and cancerous mammary cells in dogs. This study will pave the path for further in vitro work of connexins in comparative canine models and possibly allow for novel therapeutics to be developed.

Distinct biological responses of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer cells upon exposure to G-quadruplex interacting naphthalenediimide derivatives.tSmall molecules able to bind non-canonical G-quadruplex DNA structures (G4) have been recently tested as novel potential agents for the treatment of prostate cancer thanks to their repression of aberrant androgen receptor gene. However, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), a letal form of prostate cancer, is still incurable. Here we tested two naphthalenediimide derivatives, previously reported as multitarget agents, on a couple of relevant mCRPC cell models (DU145 and PC-3). We showed that these compounds interfere with the RAS/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. Interestingly, both these two biological processes depend upon Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) activation. By means of biological and analytical tools we showed that our compounds are efficient inducers of the structural transition of the EGFR promoter towards a G-quadruplex conformation, ultimately leading to a reduction of the receptor production. The overall result is an interesting cytotoxic profile for these two derivatives. Thanks to their activity at different steps, these compounds can open the way to novel therapeutic approaches for mCRPC that could contribute to escape resistance to selective treatments.

Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals tumor immune microenvironment heterogenicity and granulocytes enrichment in colorectal cancer liver metastases.tColorectal cancer (CRC) is among the top 3 leading causes of cancer-related deaths, and tumor malignant progression and metastases contribute to the high mortality of advanced CRC. Immune components in the tumor microenvironment can modulate tumor progression and are attractive therapeutic targets. Recently, intra-tumor mutational diversification of colorectal cancer cells at the single cell level was conducted. However, single cell transcriptome analysis of the microenvironment composition and characteristics in CRC liver metastases has yet to be performed. In this study, samples of liver metastasis cancer tissue and adjacent tissue from CRC patients were examined by single cell RNA sequencing. A total of 12 clusters corresponding to 6 cell types, including cancer cells, T cells, myeloid cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and B cells, were identified. Expression clustering of 445 cell cluster deregulated genes (CCDGs) identified 6 gene modules and functional enrichment was conducted to analyse the pathways in cancer cell and T cell populations. Next, the clinical significance of the expression of 93 cell cluster specifically deregulated genes (CCSDGs) in tumor-infiltrating immune cells and the correlation of the expression of these genes with patients' survival rates were investigated with the TCGA dataset. Then, the mechanisms for increased proportion of granulocytes in the cancer sample were explored, and abnormal ferroptosis-mediated granulocyte cell death was proposed. Finally, the Wnt signalling pathway was found to be activated and promote granulocytes migration. This single cell RNA sequencing study may shed light on the tumor microenvironment composition and pave the way for CRC liver metastasis therapy.

The aims of this study were to document the incidence patterns of CL, CP and CLP in different breeds of dogs, determine whether defect phenotype is associated with skull type, genetic cluster and geographic location, and estimate the financial impact in breeding programs in the United States by means of an anonymous online survey. A total of 228 orofacial clefts were reported among 7,429 puppies whelped in the 12 preceding months. Breeds in the mastiff/terrier genetic cluster and brachycephalic breeds were predisposed to orofacial clefts. Certain breeds in the ancient genetic cluster were at increased odds of orofacial clefts. Male purebred dogs were at increased odds of CPs. Results confirm that brachycephalic breeds are overrepresented among cases of orofacial clefts. Furthermore, geographic region appeared to be a relevant risk factor and orofacial clefts represented a considerable financial loss to breeders. Improved understanding of the epidemiology of orofacial clefts (frequency, causes, predictors and risk factors) may help in identifying ways to minimize their occurrence. Information gained may potentially help veterinarians and researchers to diagnose, treat and prevent orofacial clefts.

The Limited Benefit of Follow-Up Echocardiograms After Repair of Tetralogy of Fallot.tTetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease, making up 10% of all congenital heart defects. Annual follow-up echocardiograms are recommended in patients with repaired ToF, but evidence-based guidelines do not exist. We hypothesized that most echocardiograms performed in asymptomatic patients with repaired ToF and no physical exam change do not result in an actionable change (AC) in management. We retrospectively reviewed records of all patients with ToF and prior complete repair at our institution between January 2000 and September 2015. Changes in echocardiograms resulting in hospital admission, medication addition/change, cardiac catheterization, or surgical procedure were identified via chart review. These changes were referred to as an AC. A total of 1135 echocardiograms were reviewed from 233 patients (160 with initial complete repair, 70 with prior shunt, and 3 with other initial surgery). The median number of echocardiograms per patient was 5. Of the 1135 echocardiograms, 15 (1.3%) were associated with AC. Of the 15 patients with AC echocardiograms, 9 underwent a shunt prior to complete repair (9/70, 12.9%) and 6 had undergone an initial complete repair (6/160, 3.8%). The median age at AC was 6.3 years (IQR 4.4, 6.8) in the shunt group and 0.90 years (IQR 0.87, 1.1) in the initial complete repair group. In asymptomatic patients with repaired ToF and no physical exam change, echocardiograms rarely lead to a change in clinical management. In conclusion, the likelihood and timing of AC echocardiograms and reinterventions vary based on the type of initial surgery.

Connexin 26 and Connexin 43 in Canine Mammary Carcinoma.tIncidence of canine mammary carcinoma is two times higher than the rate of human breast cancer. Mammary tumors are the most common type of cancer in intact female dogs and account for about half of all neoplasms in these dogs. Well-established models of breast cancer have shown that neoplastic cells often have a loss of intercellular communication, particularly gap junction proteins. Thus, the objective of this study is to explore the aspect of gap junction intercellular communication in canine mammary carcinoma, non-cancerous (CMEC) and cancerous (CMT12, CMT27, and CF41.Mg) cells, and patient-derived tumors. Both non-cancerous and cancerous mammary cells express connexins 26 and 43 using immunofluorescence; however, the level of expression is significantly different in quantitative analysis using western blot in which connexin 43 in both CMT12 and CMT27 is significantly decreased compared to CMEC. Furthermore, a decrease of gap junction capacity in CMT12 and CMT27 was observed compared to CMEC. Immunostaining of CMT27-xenograft tumors revealed positive Cx26 and negative Cx43 expression. Similarly, immunostaining of spontaneous canine mammary tumors revealed that Cx26 is present in all tumors while Cx43 is present in 25% of tumors. Overall, the study provides for the first time that a differential pattern of connexin expression exists between non-cancerous and cancerous mammary cells in dogs. This study will pave the path for further in vitro work of connexins in comparative canine models and possibly allow for novel therapeutics to be developed.

Prognostic stratification of clinical and molecular epithelioid hemangioendothelioma subsets.tEpithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a low-grade malignant vascular tumor with an intermediate clinical behavior between benign hemangiomas and high-grade angiosarcomas. Pathologic or molecular factors to predict this clinical heterogeneity are not well defined. A WWTR1-CAMTA1 fusion is present in most classic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, regardless of their clinical behavior, suggesting that additional genetic abnormalities might be responsible in driving a more aggressive biology. A small subset of cases show distinct morphology and are characterized genetically by a YAP1-TFE3 fusion. Two histologic grades have been described in classic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the soft tissue. However, proposed criteria do not apply to other clinical presentations and have not been assessed in the YAP1-TFE3 positive tumors. Furthermore, no previous studies have compared the survival of these two molecular subsets. In this study we investigate the clinicopathologic and molecular findings of a large cohort of 93 translocation-positive epithelioid hemangioendothelioma managed at our institution. Patient characteristics, histologic features, treatment outcomes, and genetic abnormalities were investigated and these factors were correlated with overall survival. In 18 patients (15 with WWTR1-CAMTA1 and 3 with YAP1-TFE3) Memorial Sloan Kettering-IMPACT targeted DNA sequencing was performed to identify secondary genetic alterations showing more than half of tumors had a genetic alteration beyond the disease-defining gene fusion. Patients with conventional epithelioid hemangioendothelioma with WWTR1-CAMTA1 fusion had a less favorable outcome compared with the YAP1-TFE3 subset, the 5-year overall survival being 59% versus 86%, respectively. Soft tissue epithelioid hemangioendothelioma were frequently solitary, followed an uneventful clinical course being often managed with curative surgery. Multifocality, pleural involvement, lymph node or distant metastases had a significantly worse outcome. Patients with pleural disease or lymph node metastases had an aggressive clinical course akin to high-grade sarcomas, with 22% and 30%, respectively, alive at 5 years, compared with >70% survival rate in patients lacking these two adverse factors.

Back to the origins: Human brain organoids to investigate neurodegeneration.tNeurodegenerative disorders represent a high burden in terms of individual, social and economical resources. No ultimate therapy has been established so far; human brain morphology and development can not be entirely reproduced by animal models, and genomic, metabolic and biochemical differences might contribute to a limited predictive power for human translation. Thus, the development of human brain organoid models holds a wide potential to investigate the range of physiological and pathological features that characterise the early onset of the degeneration. Moreover, central nervous system development has gained a crucial role in the study of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Premature alterations during brain maturation have been related to late disease manifestations; genetic mutations responsible for neurodegeneration have been found in genes highly expressed during neural development. Elucidating the mechanisms triggering neuronal susceptibility to degeneration is crucial for pathogenetic studies and therapeutic discoveries. In the present work, we provide an overview on the current applications of human brain organoids towards studies of neurodegenerative diseases, with a survey on the recent discoveries and a closing discussion on the present challenges and future perspectives.

Age-specific 3-year cumulative risk of cervical cancer and high-grade dysplasia on biopsy in 9434 women who underwent HPV cytology cotesting.tHigh-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)-Papanicolaou (Pap) cotesting is recommended for cervical cancer screening in women aged ≥30 years. The current study analyzed the effectiveness of cotesting on risk management in different age groups.||||A retrospective review of a 5-year cytology database identified 9434 women with HPV-Pap cotesting and follow-up cervical biopsy. The 3-year cumulative risk of developing high-grade cervical lesions (≥high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL]) was analyzed using age stratification.||||The 3-year cumulative risk of developing ≥HSIL was found to be significantly different in women with baseline cotesting HPV-positive and Pap-positive results (HPV+/Pap+; defined as ≥atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance), HPV+ and Pap-negative results, and HPV-negative and Pap+ results at 19.2%, 7.9%, and 3.1%, respectively (P < .001). The risk of ≥HSIL peaked at ages 30 to 39 years and significantly decreased at ages 50 to 59 years (16.6% vs 6.7%; P < .001). Women aged <30 years shared a high risk similar to that of women aged 30 to 39 years (17.3% vs 16.6%; P = .52), and risk stratification by cotesting was found to be equally effective in the younger age group (HPV+ and Pap+: 19.6%; HPV+ and Pap-negative: 7.2%; and HPV-negative and Pap+: 4.4% [P < .001]).||||High-risk HPV-Pap cotesting appears to be extremely sensitive for the prediction of the risk of developing ≥HSIL and is an effective tool for risk stratification. In the current study, the 3-year cumulative risk of developing ≥HSIL varied significantly with age, with the highest risk noted among women aged <40 years and the lowest risk observed in women aged 50 to 59 years. Pap testing significantly impacted risk stratification in the HPV+ positive group, especially in women aged <60 years. Women aged <30 years were found to have a risk profile and cotesting efficacy similar to those of women aged 30 to 39 years. Modification of the current recommendation to offer cotesting to women aged ≥30 years might be considered to include those patients aged <30 years.

Prognostic efficacy of extensive invasion of primary tumor volume for T3-4 nasopharyngeal carcinoma receiving intensity-modulated radiotherapy.tThis study aimed to explore the prognostic value of extensive invasion of primary tumor volume for local control in patients with T3-4 NPC receiving intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).||||Between January 2009 and December 2015, initial volume of GTV-P, the confined and extensive invasion part of GTV-P (GTV-C and GTV-E) were obtained from 159 prospectively enrolled non-metastatic T3-4 NPC patients. GTV-E included the tumor with infiltration of bony structures at skull base, cervical vertebra, paranasal sinuses or with intracranial extension. GTV-C was calculated by the subtraction of GTV-E from GTV-P. The effects of tumor volume levels on local control rate (LC) were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis.||||GTV-P (P = 0.015) and GTV-E (P = 0.001) were significantly correlated with local failure, while GTV-C (P = 0.494) was not. Then optimal cut-off values of GTV-P (43 mL) and GTV-E (22 mL) were determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Patients with small (<22 mL) GTV-E achieved better 5-year LC rate than those with large (≥22 mL) GTV-E (96.3% vs.76.1%, P < 0.001), but no significant difference was found between patients with small (<43 mL) and large (≥43 mL) GTV-P (95.9% vs. 85.5%, P = 0.094).

Modeling clinical and molecular covariates of mutational process activity in cancer.tSomatic mutations result from processes related to DNA replication or environmental/lifestyle exposures. Knowing the activity of mutational processes in a tumor can inform personalized therapies, early detection, and understanding of tumorigenesis. Computational methods have revealed 30 validated signatures of mutational processes active in human cancers, where each signature is a pattern of single base substitutions. However, half of these signatures have no known etiology, and some similar signatures have distinct etiologies, making patterns of mutation signature activity hard to interpret. Existing mutation signature detection methods do not consider tumor-level clinical/demographic (e.g. smoking history) or molecular features (e.g. inactivations to DNA damage repair genes).||||To begin to address these challenges, we present the Tumor Covariate Signature Model (TCSM), the first method to directly model the effect of observed tumor-level covariates on mutation signatures. To this end, our model uses methods from Bayesian topic modeling to change the prior distribution on signature exposure conditioned on a tumor's observed covariates. We also introduce methods for imputing covariates in held-out data and for evaluating the statistical significance of signature-covariate associations. On simulated and real data, we find that TCSM outperforms both non-negative matrix factorization and topic modeling-based approaches, particularly in recovering the ground truth exposure to similar signatures. We then use TCSM to discover five mutation signatures in breast cancer and predict homologous recombination repair deficiency in held-out tumors. We also discover four signatures in a combined melanoma and lung cancer cohort-using cancer type as a covariate-and provide statistical evidence to support earlier claims that three lung cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas are misdiagnosed metastatic melanomas.||||TCSM is implemented in Python 3 and available at https://github.com/lrgr/tcsm, along with a data workflow for reproducing the experiments in the paper.||||Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform to diagnose pathogenic germline BRCA1/2 mutations from archival tumor specimens.tClinical genetic testing to diagnose germline mutations often requires blood sample or saliva smear from a cancer-affected individual. This rules out testing in families when cancer-affected individuals are deceased. We explored the use of a next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform to diagnose germline pathogenic mutations from tumors.||||Archival tumors (ovarian = 26, breast = 25, others = 9) were retrieved from 60 cancer patients who have undergone multi-gene panel blood testing. Genomic DNA was extracted and sequenced for BRCA1/2 using a NGS platform. 41/60 specimens were sequenced for 5 other genes (APC, ATM, PALB2, PTEN, TP53). Tumor testing and results interpretation were performed blinded to the blood test result.||||All 38 patients with no BRCA1/2 mutations on blood testing were correctly tested negative on tumor. Tumor testing correctly diagnosed BRCA1/2 pathogenic mutations in 15/22 (68%) patients while in 7/22 (32%) patients, the mutation was either detected but incorrectly classified as VUS (n = 3) or not detected at all (n = 4). Overall concordance rate for tumor and blood testing for BRCA1/2 mutations was 88%, with 0% false positive and 32% false negative rate for pathogenic mutations. Tumor testing correctly diagnosed 1/2 pathogenic germline ATM mutation, 1/1 pathogenic germline PALB2 mutation and 2/2 pathogenic germline TP53 mutations. False positive germline mutations were diagnosed in 4 genes at a rate of 2.4%-10.3% (APC = 2.4%, PALB2 = 2.4%, PTEN = 4.9%, TP53 = 10.3%).||||Tumor testing for BRCA1/2 germline mutations using an NGS platform is fairly reliable with no false positive findings, and correctly diagnosed more than two-thirds of pathogenic germline BRCA1/2 mutations. However, it is not reliable to diagnose pathogenic germline mutations in genes frequently mutated in sporadic cancers, such as PTEN and TP53.

Analyzing Awareness on Risk Factors, Barriers and Prevention of Cervical Cancer among Pairs of Nepali High School Students and Their Mothers.tProviding information on increased cancer risks associated with certain behaviors might encourage adolescents to initiate protective behaviors. This study firstly determined the knowledge of risk factors and prevention of cervical cancer. Secondly, it checked an association between mothers' screening practice and student's knowledge. A descriptive, cross sectional study was conducted among 253 pairs of high school students and their mothers. Knowledge on cervical cancer was significantly lower among students and mothers. While cancer screening tests, maintenance of hygiene were considered as major preventive measures for cervical cancer, human papilloma vaccine was the least considered preventive measure. Students who were female, attended discussions on cancer and had a healthy diet had better awareness of cancer. Mothers of female students had better knowledge about cervical cancer than mothers of male students. Less perceived susceptibility and lack of knowledge were major obstacles among mothers, limiting cervical cancer screening to 15%. Although association between knowledge of students and screening practice of mothers was not clear, it was observed that cancer communication increased awareness of cervical cancer in both groups. Our findings showed a strong need for school-based cancer education program to address the issues of human papillomavirus vaccinations, cervical cancer risk and screening.

Effect of Immunotherapy on Local Treatment of Genitourinary Malignancies.tManagement of metastatic genitourinary malignancies has recently been transformed through the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The best way to integrate them into local treatment paradigms is still under investigation.||||To systematically evaluate evidence regarding the use of immunotherapy in the treatment of local disease, in both the perioperative and the metastatic setting.||||We performed a critical review of PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Prospective and retrospective studies between 2011 and 2018 were included. Twenty-four publications were selected for inclusion, including 10 on urothelial carcinoma, seven on renal cell carcinoma, six on prostate cancer, and one on germ-cell cancer.||||Prospective early-phase trials investigating neoadjuvant immunotherapy prior to cystectomy in urothelial carcinoma suggest a high rate of pathological complete response, from 29% with atezolizumab to 39.5% with pembrolizumab. Several neoadjuvant and adjuvant trials are still ongoing in bladder, renal, and prostate cancers, before or after surgery. The combination of immunotherapy and radiotherapy is being explored and could offer an interesting strategy for definitive treatment modality with curative intent. Finally, in metastatic disease, delayed local treatment could be discussed after immunotherapy in selected patients with an excellent radiographic response.||||Little evidence exists on the oncological impact of immunotherapy on the local treatment of genitourinary malignancies, but preliminary results are encouraging and many prospective trials are ongoing.||||In this study, we review recent advances in immunotherapy and its role in local treatment. Immunotherapy is evaluated before or after surgery, or in combination with radiotherapy for localized disease. Ongoing trials will bring clarity on the local downstaging effect of immunotherapy and its association with oncological and functional outcomes.

[Confocal laser endomicroscopy for the treatment of upper urinary tract transitional cellcarcinoma.]tConfocal lasser endomicroscopy (CLE) is an optical technique that enables in vivo cytological characterization of a tissue. Previous studies have shown it useful in the evaluation of urinary and respiratory tracts for a better characterization of mucosal lesions, showing a high concordance between in vivo and final histopathological results. Recently, the use of CLE has been proposed for the study of transitional cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract (UUT) during ureteroscopy, because it enables real time information about tumor grade and supplements the information of ureteroscopic biopsies, which may understimate the grade and stage of the lesion up to 43% of the cases due to its limitiations.||||We performed a systematic review of the literature in the Pubmed/Medline database following the PRISMA standard. We selected 20 articles that complied with the inclusion criteria for evidence synthesis. RESULTS: Equipment miniaturization has enabled CLE as part of the diagnostic options in upper urinary tract tumors. This technique performs in vivo cytological characterization of the evaluated tissue, accomplishing differentiation between tumor and normal tissue, as well as tumor grade identification. Its communicated sensitivity and specificity reach 79%/78% respectively for low grade tumors and 67%/79% for high grade, with a substantial inter observer concordance (surgeon/pathologist; k = 0.64). No complications have been communicated in the literature with the use of fluorescein or confocal laser microscopy probes in patients undergoing this technique.||||CLE represents a useful and safe tool, capable of providing cytological real time information of UUT tumors that enables tumor grade identification with substantial concordance between in vivo tumor typifying and the final histopathological analysis. For this, CLE is currently considered a tool for conservative management of UUT transitional cell carcinoma in the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines.

Prostate carcinoma cell-derived exosomal MicroRNA-26a modulates the metastasis and tumor growth of prostate carcinoma.tProstate carcinoma may develop into metastatic castration-resistant prostate carcinoma (mCRPC) after endocrine therapy. Exosomal microRNAs play an important role in the regulation of tumor microenvironment. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of exosomal miR-26a on tumor phenotype of prostate carcinoma. Low-grade prostate carcinoma cell line (LNCAP) and mCRPC cell line (PC-3) were treated as experimental subjects according to their miR-26a expressions. Wound healing, transwell and colony-forming unit assays were performed after miR-26a mimic/inhibitor transfection. Then, exosomes were isolated from LNCAP and PC-3 cells, and the levels of exosomal miR-26a were determined. After co-culture of LNCAP (PC-3) cells with PC-3 (LNCAP) exosomes, changes in malignant behaviors were measured. Moreover, LNCAP/PC-3 exosomes were injected into xenograft tumor mice to determine effects of the exosomes on tumorigenicity of LNCAP and PC-3 cells. MiR-26a showed a potently inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, migration and invasion of LNCAP and PC-3 cells. LNCAP exosomes had a higher miR-26a level, compared with PC-3 exosomes. Overexpression of miR-26a attenuated the enhanced malignant behavior of LNCAP cells induced by PC-3 exosomes, and miR-26a inhibition could reverse the inhibitory effects of LNCAP exosomes on PC-3 cells. Exosomal miR-26a could significantly alter the expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related factors. Moreover, LNCAP exosomes suppressed the tumorigenicity of PC-3 cells, while PC-3 exosomes could promote the tumorigenicity of LNCAP cells. Our data suggest that exosomal miR-26a derived from prostate carcinoma cells had a suppressive effect on the metastasis and tumor growth of prostate carcinoma.

Vulvar and vaginal neoplasia in women with inflammatory bowel disease.tImmunosuppressive drugs are the cornerstone in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), however they are associated with an increased risk of extra-intestinal cancer. Whether the risk for female genital tract malignancies, including vulvar and vaginal cancer, is increased is less clear. Our aim was to investigate the risk of these malignancies in IBD-patients. Histopathological data of all IBD patients with a vulvar or vaginal (pre-)cancerous lesion were retrieved from the Dutch nationwide network and registry of histopathology and cytopathology from 1991 to 2015. Medical history was retrieved from patient records. Data from the Central Office for Statistics, the Dutch comprehensive cancer organization, and the IBDSL cohort were obtained to calculate the standardized, and age-adjusted incidence rates. Fifty-five patients met the inclusion criteria. A standardized incidence rate of 1.2(95% CI:0.8-1.7) for vulvar and vaginal carcinoma among adult female IBD was calculated, which did not significantly differ from the general population. The use of immunosuppressive therapy did not increase the occurrence of vulvovaginal malignancy, nor did it influence the recurrence rate. However, immunosuppressive drugs ever-users were on average 11 years younger at the time of their gynaecological diagnosis. Overall, our data do not support intensified screening for vulvar or vaginal malignancies in female IBD patients.

PLK1 contributes to autophagy by regulating MYC stabilization in osteosarcoma cells.tPLK1, a typical PLK protein, is the main driver of cancer cell growth and proliferation. It is an inhibitor of the protein kinases that is currently being investigated in clinical studies. It is often used as a tumor marker, as high PLK1 expression correlates with poor prognosis in cancer. Overexpression of MYC is a hallmark of many human cancers. MYC modulates the transcription of thousands of genes that required to coordinate a series of cellular processes, including those essential for growth, proliferation, differentiation, self-renewal and apoptosis. To date, functions of PLK1 and MYC on tumor are mostly studied in separate researches, and studies on their mutual crosstalk are lacking.||||To investigate the mechanism of PLK1 and MYC in regulating progress of osteosarcoma.||||Protein level was examined using Western blot. Animal experiments were performed with female FOX CHASE severe combined immunodeﬁcient mice. Mice were randomly divided into experimental or control groups.||||PLK1 or MYC promoted the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells through the autophagy pathway. PLK1 contributed to MYC protein stabilization. PLK1 inhibition enhanced MYC degradation in osteosarcoma cells. PLK1 inhibition led to a marked decline in MYC protein abundance. The representative MYC target genes were deregulated by PLK1 inhibitors. BI2536 treatment caused a significant delay in xenograft tumor growth in mice injected with U-2 OS cells subcutaneously, with lower mean tumor weight compared to the control group.||||PLK1 is crucial for MYC stabilization.

Diagnostic and Treatment Algorithm for Chronic Nodular Prurigo.tChronic nodular prurigo (CNPG) is a subtype of chronic prurigo, also described as prurigo nodularis, and a chronic skin condition characterized by intensely pruritic nodular lesions. Although the exact cause of CNPG is unknown, it appears to result from a repetitive itch-scratch cycle induced by neuronal sensitization to chronic pruritus. CNPG is associated with an underlying dermatologic condition in about half of patients, and can also be attributed to systemic, neurologic, psychogenic, or unknown causes. For most patients, multiple underlying causes are identified. Patients with CNPG often experience impaired quality-of-life, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and depression. To encourage consistent and accurate diagnosis and treatment of CNPG across regions, we are proposing a diagnostic and treatment algorithm, which includes initial assessment of core symptoms, detailed dermatological history and clinical examination, patient-reported outcomes, diagnostic workup, and recommended therapies. This information is supplemented with photographs to illustrate clinical appearance and disease severity. As CNPG is often multifactorial and it can take months to years for lesions to heal, interdisciplinary cooperation and long-term management are important.

Food-insecure young adults had greater odds of self-reported poor health (2.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63-4.24), diabetes (1.67, 95% CI 1.18-2.37), hypertension (1.40, 95% CI 1.14-1.72), being "very overweight" (1.30, 95% CI 1.08-1.57), and obstructive airway disease (1.48, 95% CI 1.22-1.80) in adjusted models compared with young adults who were food secure. Food insecurity was not associated with inadequate disease control among those with diabetes or hypertension.||||Food insecurity is associated with several self-reported chronic diseases and obesity in young adulthood. Health care providers should screen for food insecurity in young adults and provide referrals when appropriate. Future research should evaluate the impact of early interventions to combat food insecurity on the prevention of downstream health effects in later adulthood.

Impact of Right Ventricular Geometry and Left Ventricular Hypertrophy on Right Ventricular Mechanics and Clinical Outcomes in Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome.tRight ventricular (RV) function is a major determinant of survival in hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). However, the relation of RV geometry to myocardial mechanics and their relation to transplant-free survival are incompletely characterized.||||We retrospectively studied 48 HLHS patients from the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, (median age, 2.2; interquartile range, 3.62 years) at different surgical stages. Patients were grouped by the presence (n = 23) or absence (n = 25) of RV "apical bulging" defined as a sigmoid-shaped septum with the RV leftward apical segment contiguous with the left ventricular (LV) lateral wall. Regional and global RV strain were measured using speckle-tracking echocardiography, and regional strains were analyzed for patterns and peak values. These were compared between HLHS anatomical subtypes and between patients with versus without apical bulging. We further investigated the association between RV geometry and dysfunction with the outcomes of heart failure, death, or transplant.||||RV global (-7.3% ± 2.8% vs -11.2% ± 4.4%; P = .001), basal septal (-3.8% ± 3.2% vs -11.4% ± 5.8%; P = .0001) and apicolateral (-5.1% ± 3.5% vs -8.0% ± 5.8%, P = .001) longitudinal strain were lower in patients with versus without apical bulging, respectively. Apical bulging was equally prevalent in all HLHS anatomical variants. Twenty of 22 (91%) patients with apical bulging displayed hypertrophy of the LV apical and lateral segments. Death or transplantation were approximately equal in both groups but related to reduced RV global strain in patients with (seven of seven) and not in those without apical bulging (two of eight; P = .022).||||These results suggest that the finding of apical bulging is related to the presence of a hypertrophied hypoplastic LV, with a negative impact on regional and global RV function. Therefore, analysis of RV and LV geometry and mechanics may aid in the assessment and prognostication of this high-risk population.

Paeonia lactiflora root extract suppresses cancer cachexia by down-regulating muscular NF-κB signalling and muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases in cancer-bearing mice.tThe dried root of Paeonia lactiflora Pall. (Radix Paeoniae) has been traditionally used to treat various inflammatory diseases in many Asian countries.||||Cancer cachexia is a catabolic syndrome driven by inflammation and characterised by a loss of skeletal muscle. This study aimed to assess the effects of an ethanolic extract of Radix Paeoniae (RP) on cancer cachexia and elucidate its mechanism of action.||||The anti-cachexic effect and mechanism of RP were examined in mouse models of cancer cachexia established in C57BL/6 mice by subcutaneously injecting Lewis lung carcinoma or MC38 colon carcinoma cells. Skeletal muscle tissues were analysed by RNAseq, real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Megestrol acetate, which is recommended for the treatment of cachexia in cancer patients, was used as the comparator treatment in this study.||||In lung and colon cancer-bearing mice, RP significantly restored food intake and muscle mass, along with muscle function measured by grip strength and treadmill running time. In the skeletal muscle tissue of the cancer-bearing mice, RP suppressed NF-κB signalling and reduced inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β; it also down-regulated the muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and MAFbx.||||RP restored skeletal muscle function and mass in cancer-bearing mice by down-regulating the muscular NF-κB signalling pathway and muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases. Our study indicates that RP is a potential candidate for development as a therapeutic agent against cancer cachexia.

Long term survival and perioperative propensity score matched outcomes of diaphragmatic resections compared to stripping in cytoreductive surgery + intra-peritoneal chemotherapy.tTo assess the impact of short and long term outcomes of diaphragm resection and repair in cyto-reductive surgery (CRS) and intra-peritoneal chemotherapy (IPC).||||1230 consecutive CRS/IPC procedures were performed between 1996 and 2018 in Sydney, Australia. Among these, 652 underwent diaphragmatic intervention. The analysis was preformed according to histological subtype. First diaphragm interventions were compared to non-diaphragmatic CRS. Secondly, diaphragm resection was compared to diaphragm stripping. Overall survival and recurrence free survival was assessed based on histological diagnosis.||||There were no differences between the resection and stripping groups for the colorectal cohort. For mesothelioma, increased incidences of pleural effusions in the resection group were noted (63% vs.28%, p = 0.017). In HAMNs, the resection group was associated with increased reoperations (42% vs. 15%, p = 0.03) and in hospital death (16.7% vs. 0.6%, p = 0.012). Resection in LAMNs were linked with increased transfusion requirements (9 vs. 6, p = 0.01), reoperation (39% vs. 23%, p = 0.05) and prolonged length of stay (34 days vs. 25 days, p = 0.02). There were no differences in overall survival and recurrence free survival in colorectal cancer. Median overall survival was decreased in mesothelioma by 20 months. In LAMNs the median survival was significantly decreased for the resection group. Similarly, the resection group had a 4-month earlier recurrence.||||We conclude that diaphragm interventions are an essential part of CRS. They are associated with increased perioperative morbidity. This morbidity is not attributable to whether the patient underwent diaphragm stripping or resection. However in mesothelioma and LAMNs, requiring diaphragm resection is likely to be an indicator for tumor aggression.

Plasma VitD levels were measured in the first (T1) and/or second trimester (T2). Multiple linear and logistic regression models were used for evaluating the association of VitD with GDM.||||Prepregnancy BMI was positively associated with all three time-point glucose of OGTT. 25(OH)D level in T1 (β = -0.003) and T2 (β = -0.004), and its change from T1 to T2 (β = -0.004) were significantly and inversely associated with fasting blood glucose (FBG) of OGTT, but not 1-h and 2-h postload blood glucose of OGTT, respectively. The negative associations of VitD and FBG were stronger among overweight/obese women. VitD deficiency (25(OH)D < 20 ng/ml) in T2 was associated with an increased risk of GDM with increased FBG, GDM subtype 1 (OR: 2.10) and subtype 3 (OR: 2.19). Moreover, prepregnancy BMI modified this effect on GDM subtype 1 (BMI < 24: OR = 1.42; BMI ≥ 24: OR = 9.61, P for interaction = 0.002). Lower VitD increment from T1 to T2 was associated with a higher risk for GDM among overweight/obese women. Additionally, GDM prevalence fluctuated with the season, i.e. lower in summer/fall and higher in winter/spring.||||Maternal VitD deficiency was associated with a higher risk of GDM subtype with increased FBG, and the risk is much greater among overweight/obesity women. The lower the VitD increment during pregnancy, the greater the risk of GDM, especially in overweight/obesity women. Furthermore, seasonal variation of GDM may be exhibited as a critical confounder in the association of VitD and GDM.

Early Seizure Activity Accelerates Depletion of Hippocampal Neural Stem Cells and Impairs Spatial Discrimination in an Alzheimer's Disease Model.tAdult hippocampal neurogenesis has been reported to be decreased, increased, or not changed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and related transgenic mouse models. These disparate findings may relate to differences in disease stage, or the presence of seizures, which are associated with AD and can stimulate neurogenesis. In this study, we investigate a transgenic mouse model of AD that exhibits seizures similarly to AD patients and find that neurogenesis is increased in early stages of disease, as spontaneous seizures became evident, but is decreased below control levels as seizures recur. Treatment with the antiseizure drug levetiracetam restores neurogenesis and improves performance in a neurogenesis-associated spatial discrimination task. Our results suggest that seizures stimulate, and later accelerate the depletion of, the hippocampal neural stem cell pool. These results have implications for AD as well as any disorder accompanied by recurrent seizures, such as epilepsy.

Clinical Utility of Liver Frailty Index for Predicting Muscle Atrophy in Chronic Liver Disease Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma.tMuscle atrophy is a prognostic factor for patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Liver Frailty Index (LFI) is a simple physical function test; however, an association between LFI and muscle mass remains unclear. We aimed to investigate utility of LFI for predicting muscle atrophy in CLD patients with HCC.||||We enrolled 138 CLD patients with HCC (77 years, female/male 34.8%/65.2%). Muscle mass was assessed by skeletal muscle index and patients were classified in to Muscle atrophy group (n=109) or Non-muscle atrophy group (n=29). Physical frailty was assessed by LFI. The optimal cut-off value of LFI for predicting muscle atrophy was identified by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.||||In the Muscle atrophy group, the prevalence of pre-frail/frail was significantly higher than the Non-muscle atrophy group (87.2% vs. 58.6%, P=0.0005). In the logistic regression analysis, female and pre-frail/frail were identified as independent factors associated with muscle atrophy (pre-frail/frail; OR 3.601, 95%CI 1.381-9.400, P=0.0088). In patients with normal grip strength, 71.1% of patients were pre-frail/frail, in which 82.8% of patients showed muscle atrophy. ROC statistics provided an AUC of 0.74 and an LFI cut-off value of 2.94 for predicting muscle atrophy (sensitivity 88.06%, specificity 52.17%, accuracy 77.91%).||||We demonstrated that pre-frail/frail was an independent factor for muscle atrophy in CLD patients with HCC. Furthermore, LFI predicted muscle atrophy with high sensitivity even in patients with normal grip strength. Thus, LFI may be useful screening tool for muscle atrophy in CLD patients with HCC.

Prostate carcinoma cell-derived exosomal MicroRNA-26a modulates the metastasis and tumor growth of prostate carcinoma.tProstate carcinoma may develop into metastatic castration-resistant prostate carcinoma (mCRPC) after endocrine therapy. Exosomal microRNAs play an important role in the regulation of tumor microenvironment. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of exosomal miR-26a on tumor phenotype of prostate carcinoma. Low-grade prostate carcinoma cell line (LNCAP) and mCRPC cell line (PC-3) were treated as experimental subjects according to their miR-26a expressions. Wound healing, transwell and colony-forming unit assays were performed after miR-26a mimic/inhibitor transfection. Then, exosomes were isolated from LNCAP and PC-3 cells, and the levels of exosomal miR-26a were determined. After co-culture of LNCAP (PC-3) cells with PC-3 (LNCAP) exosomes, changes in malignant behaviors were measured. Moreover, LNCAP/PC-3 exosomes were injected into xenograft tumor mice to determine effects of the exosomes on tumorigenicity of LNCAP and PC-3 cells. MiR-26a showed a potently inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, migration and invasion of LNCAP and PC-3 cells. LNCAP exosomes had a higher miR-26a level, compared with PC-3 exosomes. Overexpression of miR-26a attenuated the enhanced malignant behavior of LNCAP cells induced by PC-3 exosomes, and miR-26a inhibition could reverse the inhibitory effects of LNCAP exosomes on PC-3 cells. Exosomal miR-26a could significantly alter the expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related factors. Moreover, LNCAP exosomes suppressed the tumorigenicity of PC-3 cells, while PC-3 exosomes could promote the tumorigenicity of LNCAP cells. Our data suggest that exosomal miR-26a derived from prostate carcinoma cells had a suppressive effect on the metastasis and tumor growth of prostate carcinoma.

The authors hypothesized that for T2 (thickness 1.1-2.0 mm) melanoma, age, and other factors may be able to identify a cohort of patients with a low risk of SLN metastases.||||The authors developed logistic regression models to predict positive SLNs in patients undergoing SLN biopsy for T2 melanoma using the National Cancer Database. Classification and regression-tree analysis were used to identify groups of patients with high and low risk for SLN metastases. The prediction model then was applied to a separate data set from a multicenter randomized clinical trial.|||| or more, axial location, and Clark level of 4 or 5 were independent risk factors for SLN metastases. A cohort based on age (> 56 years) and no LVI was identified with a relatively low risk (7.8%; 95% confidence interval 7.2-8.4%) of SLN metastases. The independent data set of 1531 patients with T2 melanoma confirmed these findings. Among elderly patients (age > 75 years) with melanoma 1.2 mm or smaller and no LVI, the risk of a positive SLN was 4.9% (95% confidence interval 3.3-7.1%).||||Younger age and LVI are powerful predictors of SLN metastases for patients with T2 melanoma. This prediction model can inform shared decision-making regarding whether to perform SLN biopsy for older patients with otherwise low-risk T2 melanoma.

Simple and accurate screening instruments are needed since RLS is underdiagnosed and treatable. We examined the operating characteristics of screening questions and a disease-specific measurement tool for the diagnosis of RLS in hemodialysis.||||We conducted a cohort study of prevalent adult hemodialysis patients in Hamilton, Canada. The diagnosis of RLS was made using the 2012 Revised International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) criteria. All participants received three screening instruments: (i) a single screening question for RLS derived from a nondialysis population; (ii) a single question from the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS); and (iii) the IRLSSG Rating Scale (IRLS). All instruments were compared with the reference standard using logistic regression from which receiver operating characteristics curves were generated. Cutoffs associated with maximum performance were identified.||||We recruited 50 participants with a mean (SD) age of 64 (12.4) years, of whom 52% were male and 92% were on three times weekly hemodialysis.

The single screening question for RLS had an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.72 with a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 58.3%. An ESAS cutoff of ≥1 had the highest AUROC at 0.65 with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 56%.

We reported in here the first case of an in utero embolization of chorioangioma diagnosed at 22 W G with a post-natal diagnosis of neonatal multifocal hemangioma with a good outcome. The chorioangioma was embolized using GLUBRAN 2 ® (cyanolacrylate) a biologic surgical glue at 26 W G. Premature rupture of membrane occurred at 28 W G. A cesarean section at 32 W G was performed for retro placental hematoma. The neonate was 1400 g healthy girl with an anemia (hemoglobin 9.7 g/dl). After one month of life, the child met a neonatal multifocal hemangioma (skin and liver were involved) with superficial erosion of skin hemangiomas that required post-natal transfusions. We propose a literature review related to the various technics of in utero treatment of placental chorioangioma and the links with neonatal multifocal hemangiomatosis as well.

CANet: Cross-disease Attention Network for Joint Diabetic Retinopathy and Diabetic Macular Edema Grading.tDiabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) are the leading causes of permanent blindness in the working-age population. Automatic grading of DR and DME helps ophthalmologists design tailored treatments to patients, thus is of vital importance in the clinical practice. However, prior works either grade DR or DME, and ignore the correlation between DR and its complication, i.e., DME. Moreover, the location information, e.g., macula and soft hard exhaust annotations, are widely used as a prior for grading. Such annotations are costly to obtain, hence it is desirable to develop automatic grading methods with only image-level supervision. In this paper, we present a novel cross-disease attention network (CANet) to jointly grade DR and DME by exploring the internal relationship between the diseases with only image-level supervision. Our key contributions include the disease-specific attention module to selectively learn useful features for individual diseases, and the disease-dependent attention module to further capture the internal relationship between the two diseases. We integrate these two attention modules in a deep network to produce disease-specific and diseasedependent features, and to maximize the overall performance jointly for grading DR and DME. We evaluate our network on two public benchmark datasets, i.e., ISBI 2018 IDRiD challenge dataset and Messidor dataset. Our method achieves the best result on the ISBI 2018 IDRiD challenge dataset and outperforms other methods on the Messidor dataset.

Chagas Disease and Heart Failure: An Expanding Issue Worldwide.tChagas disease, originally a South American endemic health problem, is expanding worldwide because of people migration. Its main impact is on the cardiovascular system, producing myocardial damage that frequently results in heart failure. Pathogenic pathways are mainly related to inmunoinflamatory reactions in the myocardium and, less frequently, in the gastrointestinal tract. The heart usually shows fibrosis, producing dilatation and damage of the electrogenic cardiac system. These changes result in cardiomyopathy with heart failure and frequent cardiac arrhythmias and heart blocks. Diagnosis of the disease must include a lab test to detect the parasite or its immune reactions and the usual techniques to evaluate cardiac function. Therapeutic management of Chagas heart failure does not differ significantly from the most common treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy, with special focus on arrhythmias and several degrees of heart block.

High expression of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 22 is associated with poor prognosis in hepatitis B virus-associated liver cancer.tDeubiquitinating enzymes regulate protein activity and cell homeostasis by removing ubiquitin moieties from various substrates. Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 22 (USP22) is a member of the deubiquitinating protease family and is associated with the development of several tumor types. A previous study demonstrated that USP22 is highly expressed in liver cancer, and its high expression is associated with resistance to chemotherapy. However, the role of USP22 in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated liver cancer has not yet been elucidated. The current study demonstrated that USP22 was highly expressed in the tissues of patients with HBV-associated liver cancer, and its high expression was associated with clinicopathological characteristics, including tumor size, clinical stage and prognosis. Further results indicated that USP22 may regulate the proliferative and apoptotic abilities of HepG2.2.15 cells. Additionally, investigation into the underlying mechanism, using small interfering RNA, revealed that the downregulation of USP22 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis though the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathway. Therefore, USP22 has the potential to be used as an independent predictor of patient prognosis, as well as a therapeutic target for the treatment of HBV-associated liver cancer.

Steroids in the treatment of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy: A PRISMA-compliant meta-analysis.tNon-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is the common cause of acute and subacute optic neuropathy in adults over the age of 50. Steroid administration in NAION seems to be in practice and is advised frequently by neurologists. The controversy regarding steroid usage in NAION is far from settled, with strong opinions on both sides. Despite a large amount of articles on this topic, but the results have not always been consistent. To address this gap, we decided to conduct a meta-analysis of all available published studies in order to better understand the effectiveness of steroids in treating NAION.||||To identify the effectiveness of steroids in treating NAION.||||We performed a meta-analysis using databases, including PUBMED EMBASE, and the Cochrane library, to find relevant studies. The weighted mean difference (WMD) was determined for BCVA in steroid and nonsteroid groups.||||Eight studies were included and summarized in this analysis. The studies included 720 eyes (392 NAION eyes and 328 eyes of normal controls). Heterogeneity among these studies was low (I = 0%). Because of the presence of heterogeneity, we conducted a fixed effects model to assess the effect of steroids on visual acuity in patients with NAION. The meta-analysis clearly demonstrated that in NAION, steroids did not significantly improve visual acuity (WMD = -0.02 [95% CI: -0.10 to 0.06], Z = 0.40, P = .69). After sensitivity analysis via the leave-one-out method, WMD was not significantly changed.||||Our meta-analysis found that steroids do not significantly improve visual acuity in NAION. In view of their long list of side effects, attempts at reversing ischemia should not involve the use of steroids.

Metagenomic and metabolomic analyses reveal distinct stage-specific phenotypes of the gut microbiota in colorectal cancer.tIn most cases of sporadic colorectal cancers, tumorigenesis is a multistep process, involving genomic alterations in parallel with morphologic changes. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that the human gut microbiome is linked to the development of colorectal cancer. Here we performed fecal metagenomic and metabolomic studies on samples from a large cohort of 616 participants who underwent colonoscopy to assess taxonomic and functional characteristics of gut microbiota and metabolites. Microbiome and metabolome shifts were apparent in cases of multiple polypoid adenomas and intramucosal carcinomas, in addition to more advanced lesions. We found two distinct patterns of microbiome elevations. First, the relative abundance of Fusobacterium nucleatum spp. was significantly (P < 0.005) elevated continuously from intramucosal carcinoma to more advanced stages. Second, Atopobium parvulum and Actinomyces odontolyticus, which co-occurred in intramucosal carcinomas, were significantly (P < 0.005) increased only in multiple polypoid adenomas and/or intramucosal carcinomas. Metabolome analyses showed that branched-chain amino acids and phenylalanine were significantly (P < 0.005) increased in intramucosal carcinomas and bile acids, including deoxycholate, were significantly (P < 0.005) elevated in multiple polypoid adenomas and/or intramucosal carcinomas. We identified metagenomic and metabolomic markers to discriminate cases of intramucosal carcinoma from the healthy controls. Our large-cohort multi-omics data indicate that shifts in the microbiome and metabolome occur from the very early stages of the development of colorectal cancer, which is of possible etiological and diagnostic importance.

Plasma VitD levels were measured in the first (T1) and/or second trimester (T2). Multiple linear and logistic regression models were used for evaluating the association of VitD with GDM.||||Prepregnancy BMI was positively associated with all three time-point glucose of OGTT. 25(OH)D level in T1 (β = -0.003) and T2 (β = -0.004), and its change from T1 to T2 (β = -0.004) were significantly and inversely associated with fasting blood glucose (FBG) of OGTT, but not 1-h and 2-h postload blood glucose of OGTT, respectively. The negative associations of VitD and FBG were stronger among overweight/obese women. VitD deficiency (25(OH)D < 20 ng/ml) in T2 was associated with an increased risk of GDM with increased FBG, GDM subtype 1 (OR: 2.10) and subtype 3 (OR: 2.19). Moreover, prepregnancy BMI modified this effect on GDM subtype 1 (BMI < 24: OR = 1.42; BMI ≥ 24: OR = 9.61, P for interaction = 0.002). Lower VitD increment from T1 to T2 was associated with a higher risk for GDM among overweight/obese women. Additionally, GDM prevalence fluctuated with the season, i.e. lower in summer/fall and higher in winter/spring.||||Maternal VitD deficiency was associated with a higher risk of GDM subtype with increased FBG, and the risk is much greater among overweight/obesity women. The lower the VitD increment during pregnancy, the greater the risk of GDM, especially in overweight/obesity women.

Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals tumor immune microenvironment heterogenicity and granulocytes enrichment in colorectal cancer liver metastases.tColorectal cancer (CRC) is among the top 3 leading causes of cancer-related deaths, and tumor malignant progression and metastases contribute to the high mortality of advanced CRC. Immune components in the tumor microenvironment can modulate tumor progression and are attractive therapeutic targets. Recently, intra-tumor mutational diversification of colorectal cancer cells at the single cell level was conducted. However, single cell transcriptome analysis of the microenvironment composition and characteristics in CRC liver metastases has yet to be performed. In this study, samples of liver metastasis cancer tissue and adjacent tissue from CRC patients were examined by single cell RNA sequencing. A total of 12 clusters corresponding to 6 cell types, including cancer cells, T cells, myeloid cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and B cells, were identified. Expression clustering of 445 cell cluster deregulated genes (CCDGs) identified 6 gene modules and functional enrichment was conducted to analyse the pathways in cancer cell and T cell populations. Next, the clinical significance of the expression of 93 cell cluster specifically deregulated genes (CCSDGs) in tumor-infiltrating immune cells and the correlation of the expression of these genes with patients' survival rates were investigated with the TCGA dataset. Then, the mechanisms for increased proportion of granulocytes in the cancer sample were explored, and abnormal ferroptosis-mediated granulocyte cell death was proposed. Finally, the Wnt signalling pathway was found to be activated and promote granulocytes migration. This single cell RNA sequencing study may shed light on the tumor microenvironment composition and pave the way for CRC liver metastasis therapy.

There was a steady increase in tinnitus incidence throughout the study period. Approximately 80% of tinnitus cases were diagnosed at age 40 years or older. We observed the highest incidence rate in individuals aged 60-69 years (41.2 per 10,000 person-years, 95% CI: 40.7-41.7). Smokers and alcohol drinkers were at lower risk of being diagnosed with tinnitus compared with non-smokers and non-drinkers, respectively.

Early Seizure Activity Accelerates Depletion of Hippocampal Neural Stem Cells and Impairs Spatial Discrimination in an Alzheimer's Disease Model.tAdult hippocampal neurogenesis has been reported to be decreased, increased, or not changed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and related transgenic mouse models. These disparate findings may relate to differences in disease stage, or the presence of seizures, which are associated with AD and can stimulate neurogenesis. In this study, we investigate a transgenic mouse model of AD that exhibits seizures similarly to AD patients and find that neurogenesis is increased in early stages of disease, as spontaneous seizures became evident, but is decreased below control levels as seizures recur. Treatment with the antiseizure drug levetiracetam restores neurogenesis and improves performance in a neurogenesis-associated spatial discrimination task. Our results suggest that seizures stimulate, and later accelerate the depletion of, the hippocampal neural stem cell pool. These results have implications for AD as well as any disorder accompanied by recurrent seizures, such as epilepsy.

Expression of carcinoma, apoptosis, and cell-death-related genes are determinants for sensitivity of pediatric cancer cell lines to lysis by natural killer cells.tNatural killer (NK) cells have potential utility in pediatric cancer immunotherapy for their ability to lyse diverse tumor targets, lack of dependence on mutation-associated tumor antigens, and for their relative safety demonstrated so far in clinical trials. Here, we evaluate the cytotoxic potential of expanded NK cells against a well-characterized panel of pediatric cancer cell lines representing Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, lymphoma, leukemia, and brain tumors. We correlate their sensitivity NK cell lysis with tumor phenotypic, transcriptomic, and genetic determinants, and correlate known immunogenetic determinants with donor NK cell potency. Although ligand expression on cell lines stratified according to hematologic versus nonhematologic cancer types, the sensitivity to NK cell lysis varied widely and did not correlate with cancer type, expression of individual activating or inhibitory ligands, gene-expression clusters of NK cell ligands, disease status (newly diagnosed or relapsed), or MYCN amplification. Rather, sensitivity to NK cell-mediated lysis was associated with a novel 96-gene cluster of predominantly carcinoma-, apoptosis-, and cell death-related pathways, and with functional p53 status. NK cell potency was strongly associated with activating KIR gene content, but not with KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch. This study suggests that adoptive immunotherapy with expanded NK cells has the potential for a wide range of pediatric cancers, identifies potential biomarkers of efficacy and response, and establishes a foundation for using this cell line panel for the preclinical evaluation of immunotherapies.

To our knowledge, only 3 cases in the parotid gland have been reported to date. We report a case of a 62-year-old woman who presented with a 1-year history of a slow-growing, painless mass over the left mandibular angle. Imaging studies showed a 2cm mass over the left parotid gland with peripheral calcifications. The patient underwent a superficial parotidectomy. Sections displayed neoplastic epithelioid cells with cytoplasmic vacuoles containing erythrocytes, surrounded by a myxohyaline stroma. Immunohistochemistry was positive for CD31, CD34, ERG, and factor VIII, but negative for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, CK7, EMA, SMA, and S100. The findings were those of an EHE involving the parotid gland. This case demonstrates an EHE in a rare location and emphasizes the need to consider this tumor when diagnosing uncommon soft tissue tumors of salivary glands.

Aberrant DNA methylation of PAX1, SOX1 and ZNF582 genes as potential biomarkers for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.tEsophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a highly invasive malignant tumor and the majority of patients have advanced stage of ESCC at diagnosis with poor outcome. Identification of sensitive and specific biomarkers for early screening of ESCC is critical for improving patient overall survival.||||Pyrosequencing was used to determine the magnitude of DNA methylation on the selected regions PAX1 (paired box gene1), SOX1(sex determining region Y-box-1), and ZNF582 (zinc finger protein 582) in ESCC.||||The methylation levels ofPAX1, SOX1, and ZNF582 genes were significantly higher in the cancerous tissues compared to those in the non-cancerous (all P < 0.0001). The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of PAX1 methylation for the detection of cancer were respectively 0.754, 96.0% and 51.4%; for SOX1 which were 0.781, 89.2% and 59.5%; for ZNF582 which were 0.898, 93.2% and 75.7%. Most importantly, both the sensitivity and specificity of ZNF582 methylation testing achieved 100% in female ESCC patients. Hypermethylation of PAX1/SOX1/ZNF582 exhibited as an independent risk factor for ESCC development. In addition, ZNF582 methylation level in tumor tissue from the female patients was higher than that from male patients, and it was higher in the moderate and poor differentiated tumors compared to that in well-differentiated tumors. SOX1 methylation level was significantly higher in tumors located in the upper region than those located in the middle or lower regions.||||The methylation levels ofPAX1, SOX1 and ZNF582 genes were all higher in cancer tissues than in paired-adjacent and normal tissues, suggesting that detection of PAX1/SOX1/ZNF582 methylation status may serve as a promising biomarker for ESCC screening and diagnosis.

Prognostic stratification of clinical and molecular epithelioid hemangioendothelioma subsets.tEpithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a low-grade malignant vascular tumor with an intermediate clinical behavior between benign hemangiomas and high-grade angiosarcomas. Pathologic or molecular factors to predict this clinical heterogeneity are not well defined. A WWTR1-CAMTA1 fusion is present in most classic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, regardless of their clinical behavior, suggesting that additional genetic abnormalities might be responsible in driving a more aggressive biology. A small subset of cases show distinct morphology and are characterized genetically by a YAP1-TFE3 fusion. Two histologic grades have been described in classic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the soft tissue. However, proposed criteria do not apply to other clinical presentations and have not been assessed in the YAP1-TFE3 positive tumors. Furthermore, no previous studies have compared the survival of these two molecular subsets. In this study we investigate the clinicopathologic and molecular findings of a large cohort of 93 translocation-positive epithelioid hemangioendothelioma managed at our institution. Patient characteristics, histologic features, treatment outcomes, and genetic abnormalities were investigated and these factors were correlated with overall survival. In 18 patients (15 with WWTR1-CAMTA1 and 3 with YAP1-TFE3) Memorial Sloan Kettering-IMPACT targeted DNA sequencing was performed to identify secondary genetic alterations showing more than half of tumors had a genetic alteration beyond the disease-defining gene fusion. Patients with conventional epithelioid hemangioendothelioma with WWTR1-CAMTA1 fusion had a less favorable outcome compared with the YAP1-TFE3 subset, the 5-year overall survival being 59% versus 86%, respectively. Soft tissue epithelioid hemangioendothelioma were frequently solitary, followed an uneventful clinical course being often managed with curative surgery. Multifocality, pleural involvement, lymph node or distant metastases had a significantly worse outcome. Patients with pleural disease or lymph node metastases had an aggressive clinical course akin to high-grade sarcomas, with 22% and 30%, respectively, alive at 5 years, compared with >70% survival rate in patients lacking these two adverse factors.

Differential expression profiling of lncRNAs related to Epstein-Barr virus infection in the epithelial cells.tEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a prevalent γ-herpesvirus associated with a variety of cancers, including epithelial nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and gastric carcinoma (GC). Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as powerful regulators that have demonstrated to play crucial roles in cancer development. In this approach, based on genome-wide RNA sequencing, we examined the lncRNA expression profiles in four EBV genome-infected and EBV-negative 293 cells. A series of lncRNAs were found to be dysregulated in a comparative analysis. Then, eight typical lncRNAs were selected for validation of expression levels by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and were detected in EBV-positive or EBV-negative GC and NPC cells. The differential expression patterns of the eight lncRNAs for validation were fundamentally identical to those revealed in RNA sequencing. Particularly, the differential expression of these lncRNAs in GC and NPC cells indicated their possible roles in EBV infection and tumorigenesis. In addition, a predicted lncRNA-microRNA-messenger RNA network suggested their potential interactions. This study reveals the first lncRNAome related to EBV infection in the epithelial cells and provides novel clues for the study of viral role in epithelial cancers through the interaction between EBV and host lncRNAs.

Streptokinase: An Efficient Enzyme in Cardiac Medicine.tAn imbalance in oxygen supply to cardiac tissues or formation of thrombus leads to deleterious results like pulmonary embolism, coronary heart disease and acute cardiac failure. The formation of thrombus requires clinical encounter with fibrinolytic agents including streptokinase, urokinase or tissue plasminogen activator. Irrespective to urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase is still a significant agent in treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Streptokinase, being so economical, has an important value in treating cardiac diseases in developing countries. This review paper will provide the maximum information to enlighten all the pros and cons of streptokinase up till now. It has been concluded that recent advances in structural/synthetic biology improved SK with enhanced half-life and least antigenicity. Such enzyme preparations would be the best thrombolytic agents.

Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals tumor immune microenvironment heterogenicity and granulocytes enrichment in colorectal cancer liver metastases.tColorectal cancer (CRC) is among the top 3 leading causes of cancer-related deaths, and tumor malignant progression and metastases contribute to the high mortality of advanced CRC. Immune components in the tumor microenvironment can modulate tumor progression and are attractive therapeutic targets. Recently, intra-tumor mutational diversification of colorectal cancer cells at the single cell level was conducted. However, single cell transcriptome analysis of the microenvironment composition and characteristics in CRC liver metastases has yet to be performed. In this study, samples of liver metastasis cancer tissue and adjacent tissue from CRC patients were examined by single cell RNA sequencing. A total of 12 clusters corresponding to 6 cell types, including cancer cells, T cells, myeloid cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and B cells, were identified. Expression clustering of 445 cell cluster deregulated genes (CCDGs) identified 6 gene modules and functional enrichment was conducted to analyse the pathways in cancer cell and T cell populations. Next, the clinical significance of the expression of 93 cell cluster specifically deregulated genes (CCSDGs) in tumor-infiltrating immune cells and the correlation of the expression of these genes with patients' survival rates were investigated with the TCGA dataset. Then, the mechanisms for increased proportion of granulocytes in the cancer sample were explored, and abnormal ferroptosis-mediated granulocyte cell death was proposed. Finally, the Wnt signalling pathway was found to be activated and promote granulocytes migration. This single cell RNA sequencing study may shed light on the tumor microenvironment composition and pave the way for CRC liver metastasis therapy.

In utero embolization for placental chorioangioma and neonatal multifocal hemangiomatosis.tPlacental chorioangioma is a limited non trophoblastic vascular tumour that may causes fetal complications as well as post-natal ones. We reported in here the first case of an in utero embolization of chorioangioma diagnosed at 22 W G with a post-natal diagnosis of neonatal multifocal hemangioma with a good outcome. The chorioangioma was embolized using GLUBRAN 2 ® (cyanolacrylate) a biologic surgical glue at 26 W G. Premature rupture of membrane occurred at 28 W G. A cesarean section at 32 W G was performed for retro placental hematoma. The neonate was 1400 g healthy girl with an anemia (hemoglobin 9.7 g/dl). After one month of life, the child met a neonatal multifocal hemangioma (skin and liver were involved) with superficial erosion of skin hemangiomas that required post-natal transfusions. We propose a literature review related to the various technics of in utero treatment of placental chorioangioma and the links with neonatal multifocal hemangiomatosis as well.

Identification of key genes in invasive clinically non-functioning pituitary adenoma by integrating analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression profiles.tTumor surrounding the internal carotid artery or invading to the cavernous sinus is an important characteristic of invasive pituitary adenoma, and a pivotal factor of tumor residue and regrowth. Without specific changes in serum hormone related to the adenohypophyseal cell of origin, clinically non-functioning pituitary adenoma is more likely to be diagnosed at invasive stages compared with functioning pituitary adenoma. The underlying mechanism of tumor invasion remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to identify key genes in tumor invasion by integrating analyses of DNA methylation and gene expression profiles.||||Genome-wide DNA methylation and mRNA microarray analysis were performed for tumor samples from 68 patients at the Beijing Tiantan Hospital. Differentially expressed genes and methylated probes were identified based on an invasive vs non-invasive grouping. Differentially methylated probes in the promoter region of targeted genes were assessed. Pearson correlation analysis was used to identify genes with a strong association between DNA methylation status and expression levels. Pyrosequencing and RT-PCR were used to validate the methylation status and expression levels of candidate genes, respectively.||||A total of 8842 differentially methylated probes, located on 4582 genes, and 661 differentially expressed genes were identified. Both promoter methylation and expression alterations were observed for 115 genes with 58 genes showing a negative correlation between DNA methylation status and expression level. Nineteen genes that exhibited notably negative correlations between DNA methylation and gene expression levels, are involved in various gene ontologies and pathways, or played an important role in different diseases, were regarded as candidate genes. We found an increased methylation with a decreased expression of PHYHD1, LTBR, C22orf42, PRR5, ANKDD1A, RAB13, CAMKV, KIFC3, WNT4 and STAT6, and a decreased methylation with an increased expression of MYBPHL. The methylation status and expression levels of these genes were validated by pyrosequencing and RT-PCR.||||The DNA methylation and expression levels of PHYHD1, LTBR, MYBPHL, C22orf42, PRR5, ANKDD1A, RAB13, CAMKV, KIFC3, WNT4 and STAT6 are associated with tumor invasion, and these genes may become the potential genes for targeted therapy.
