3d13399890	MLT ameliorated ethanol-induced @CELL$ injury in both cell and animal models (optimal doses of 10 μmol/L and 5 mg/kg, respectively), including lowered @DISEASE$, cell death, and inflammation.	other
633861f8b5	Excessive proliferation and defective differentiation of @CELL$ are typical characteristics of @DISEASE$, and the mutations in the lanosterol synthase (LSS) gene have been proven to induce over-proliferation and differentiation disorders of KCs.	proliferation

6639c7a1e8	Many of the patients with FRDA chronically “leak” cardiac troponins, which is recognized in published reports about adult ischemic and @DISEASE$ as an indication of @CELL$ injury and death with poor long-term outcome for a variety of cardiac insults.	dysfunction
5e19985794	(D) Bar graphs show gene expression of ISG MX1 in @CELL$ from @DISEASE$ patients pretreatment cultured with or without cGAS inhibitor (n=5), TLR-9 antagonist (n=10), NAC (n=11) or in medium alone (untreated) (n=11).	other
