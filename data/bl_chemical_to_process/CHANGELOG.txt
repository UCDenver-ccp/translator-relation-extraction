0.5
- trained on real sentences judged by GPT (chemical_process.bert.v4+v2-filtered.random.tsv)
- added in training examples used for the v2 model filtered to remove general terms like "synthesis"

0.4
- trained on real sentences judged by GPT (chemical_process.bert.v4.random.tsv)
- removed general terms like "synthesis" and "metabolism"

v0.3
- trained on real sentences judged by GPT (chemical_process.bert.v2+3.random.tsv)
- processes still included general terms like "synthesis" and "metabolism"

v0.2
- trained on real sentences judged by GPT (chemical_process.bert.v2.random.tsv)

v0.1
- trained on synthetic sentences generated by GPT
