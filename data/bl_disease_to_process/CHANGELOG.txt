v0.6
- trained on real sentences judged by GPT (disease_process.bert.v2+3.random.tsv)

v0.5
- trained on real sentences judged by GPT (disease_process.bert.v2.random.tsv)

v0.4
- trained on synthetic sentences created by GPT (disease-has_basis_in-biological_process.synthetic.bert.v1.random.tsv)
- predicate is now has_basis_in

v0.3
- decent performance - no change in the data. Not sure why.

v0.2
- strangely poor performance on v0.1; v0.2 was worse

v0.1
- trained on synthetic sentences created by GPT (assoc-with-disease.biological_process.synthetic.bert.v1.random.tsv)
