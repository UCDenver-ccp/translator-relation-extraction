[Predictive biomarkers in bladder cancer].||||||||In the last few years, significant progress has been achieved in the therapeutic options for advanced urothelial bladder cancer.||||The aim of this work was to give an overview of the status and future perspective of the therapeutic options in this setting. Its focus is on the discussion of tissue-based therapy-predictive markers, which are evaluated through (molecular) pathology and thereby strengthening the role of pathology itself.||||Current (clinical study) data, the literature, and our own expertise were considered and summarized in the areas of therapy prediction of platinum-based chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and other therapeutic approaches.||||Molecular subtypes exhibit a predictive value both in platinum-based chemotherapy as well as in immunotherapy. However, further work is required to elucidate the predictive role of molecular subtypes in both settings. Changes in the DNA damage repair enzyme (DDR) genes, ERCC2, and ERBB2 as well as differences in the expression of EMMPRIN, survivin, and HMGA2 show promising results as further markers of chemotherapy efficacy. In the prediction of immunotherapy success, this mainly relates to the evaluation of the tumor mutation burden (TMB), tumor neoantigen burden (TNB), APOBEC signatures (MSig1; 3A/3B), and CD8-positive T‑effector cell signature. When using the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor erdafitinib, which has not yet been approved in Germany, the evaluation of specific FGFR mutations and/or gene fusions by a companion diagnostic test is mandatory in the USA.

As the discovery of their malignant potential dates back more than three decades, cellular mutated RAS genes and their products belong to the best characterized cancer genes. Despite urgent clinical needs, RAS therapies are still elusive and limited to preclinical studies. However, very recently, novel and promising approaches have become a reality in clinical applications and trials. In the near future, interesting therapeutic options will emerge that are capable of targeting "undruggable" RAS. This will be even more important as the detection of RAS mutations has already been an integral part of routine molecular diagnostics for many years.

However, symptomatic and bigger tumors can be difficult to manage surgically and require detailed surgical planning prior to proceeding with bariatric surgery.||||58year old female who presented for weight loss consultation. Underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that demonstrated a 3cm mass near the incisura. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and biopsy demonstrated a submucosal lipoma. Due to the lipoma's location, resection was critical, as it would have led to obstructive symptoms following sleeve gastrectomy. The patient underwent a simultaneous laparoscopic vertical gastrectomy, gastric lipoma excision, EGD, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy DISCUSSION: Gastric lipomas are benign gastric submucosal tumors, representing less than 3% of all benign gastric neoplasms. Computer tomography and endoscopic ultrasound are important in establishing diagnosis. In current literature, excision with negative margins is standard of care, but small asymptomatic lesions can be followed without intervention.||||Gastric lipoma are a rare type of gastric submucosal tumors. Size is highly variable. Observation is a reasonable approach when small and asymptomatic, but multiple surgical modalities can be utilized to remove the tumor. Careful utilization of pre-operative imaging including EUS is critical in choosing the appropriate surgery if simultaneous bariatric management is undertaken.

An effectual PHB accumulating Bacillus cereus strain VIT-SSR1 was isolated from industrial effluent contaminated site. Plackett-Burman design was used to screen the critical factors affecting PHA production. Response surface method was employed to evaluate the interactive effects between the independent variables. The Central composite design was performed to optimize the concentrations of Molasses, ammonium sulphate and initial pH. A PHA content of (1.42 ± 0.01) g/L and a maximum PHA yield of (40.3 ± 0.77) % was obtained on implementing the optimized conditions. The produced biopolymer was analysed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis(GC-MS) and the thermal properties of the biopolymer were evaluated by Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and from the Nuclear magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis the biopolymer was identified to be polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). PHB-chitosan blends were prepared and tested for biocompatibility by MTT assay on L929 mouse fibroblast cell lines. Curcumin, a well-known drug was loaded onto PHB-chitosan films and their drug release pattern was observed. Curcumin showed a sustained mode of drug release. PHB films are biocompatible and can act as a potent polymer matrix for drug release studies.

Dystonia genes and their biological pathways.||||||||The dystonias are a group of disorders characterized by excessive contraction of muscles leading to abnormal involuntary movements. The clinical manifestations are very heterogeneous, with numerous distinct syndromes. The etiologies for dystonia are also heterogeneous with idiopathic, acquired, and inherited forms. Technological advances in genetics over the past two decades have led to a rapid growth in the number of genes associated with dystonia. These genes encode proteins with very diverse biological functions. This review focusses on genes that have contributed to understanding shared biological pathways relevant to specific subgroups of dystonia syndromes. Although many potential shared biological pathways have been proposed, the ones addressed here include defects in dopamine signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction and energy maintenance, toxic accumulation of heavy metals in the brain, and calcium channels and abnormal calcium homeostasis. Elucidation of these and other shared pathways is important for understanding the biological basis for dystonia and for designing novel experimental therapeutics that have the broadest potential for multiple types of dystonia.

Mechanisms of acquired tumor drug resistance.||||||||Systemic therapy often results in the reduction of tumor size but rarely succeeds in eradicating all cancer cells. Drug efflux, persistence of cancer stem cells (CSCs), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and down-regulation of apoptosis are the most known general causes of therapy failure. Tumor escape from targeted compounds often involves pathway-specific mechanisms, which result in the restoration of the affected signaling cascade. The acquisition of drug resistance is mediated by mutations, changes in gene expression, alternative splicing, post-translational protein modifications, etc. Development of resistance to therapy may not necessary involve the emergence of new tumor clones: multiple studies demonstrate that even chemonaive neoplasms already have a small population of cells, which are capable of surviving therapeutic pressure and facilitating the disease progression. Use of combinations of cancer drugs, sequential therapy, adaptive therapy and topical ablation of drug-resistant malignant lumps may help to prolong the time to treatment failure. Many studies on mechanisms of drug resistance rely on the use of cell cultures and animal models. The development of approaches that allow efficient monitoring of the evolution of tumor phenotype in clinical setting presents a challenge.

The emerging role of circular RNAs in breast cancer.||||||||Breast cancer (BCa) is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers and leading cause of cancer deaths among females worldwide. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a new class of endogenous regulatory RNAs characterized by circular shape resulting from covalently closed continuous loops that are capable of regulating gene expression at transcription or post-transcription levels. With the unique structures, circRNAs are resistant to exonuclease RNase R and maintain stability more easily than linear RNAs. Recently, an increasing number of circRNAs are discovered and reported to show different expression in BCa and these dysregulated circRNAs were correlated with patients' clinical characteristics and grade in the progression of BCa. CircRNAs participate in the bioprocesses of carcinogenesis of BCa, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, tumorigenesis, vascularization, cell invasion, migration as well as metastasis. Here we concentrated on biogenesis and function of circRNAs, summarized their implications in BCa and discussed their potential as diagnostic and therapeutic targets for BCa.

The molecular genetic make-up of male breast cancer.||||||||Male breast cancer (MBC) is extremely rare and accounts for less than 1% of all breast malignancies. Therefore, clinical management of MBC is currently guided by research on the disease in females. In this study, DNA obtained from 45 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) MBCs with and 90 MBCs (52 FFPE and 38 fresh-frozen) without matched normal tissues was subjected to massively parallel sequencing targeting all exons of 1943 cancer-related genes. The landscape of mutations and copy number alterations was compared to that of publicly available estrogen receptor (ER)-positive female breast cancers (smFBCs) and correlated to prognosis. From the 135 MBCs, 90% showed ductal histology, 96% were ER-positive, 66% were progesterone receptor (PR)-positive, and 2% HER2-positive, resulting in 50%, 46% and 4% luminal A-like, luminal B-like and basal-like cases, respectively. Five patients had Klinefelter syndrome (4%) and 11% of patients harbored pathogenic BRCA2 germline mutations. The genomic landscape of MBC to some extent recapitulated that of smFBC, with recurrent PIK3CA (36%) and GATA3 (15%) somatic mutations, and with 40% of the most frequently amplified genes overlapping between both sexes. TP53 (3%) somatic mutations were significantly less frequent in MBC compared to smFBC whereas somatic mutations in genes regulating chromatin function and homologous recombination deficiency-related signatures were more prevalent. MDM2 amplifications were frequent (11%), correlated with protein overexpression (p=0.001) and predicted poor outcome (p=0.007). In conclusion, despite similarities in the genomic landscape between MBC and smFBC, MBC is a molecularly unique and heterogeneous disease requiring its own clinical trials and treatment guidelines.

A functional model emerges from a 50 year mystery.||||||||For the past 50 years, understanding the function of histone H1 heterogeneity has been mired in confusion and contradiction. Part of the reason for this is the lack of a working model that tries to explain the large body of data that has been collected about the H1 subtypes so far. In this review, a global model is described largely based on published data from the author and other researchers over the past 20 years. The intrinsic disorder built into H1 protein structure is discussed to help the reader understand that these histones are multi-conformational and adaptable to interactions with different targets. We discuss the role of each structural section of H1 (as we currently understand it), but we focus on the H1's C-terminal domain and its effect on each subtype's affinity, mobility and compaction of chromatin. We review the multiple ways these characteristics have been measured from circular dichroism to FRAP analysis, which has added to the sometimes contradictory assumptions made about each subtype. Based on a tabulation of these measurements, we then organize the H1 variants according to their ability to condense chromatin and produce nucleosome repeat lengths amenable to that compaction. This subtype variation generates a continuum of different chromatin states allowing for fine regulatory control and some overlap in the event one or two subtypes are lost to mutation. We also review the myriad of disparate observations made about each subtype, both somatic and germline specific ones, that lend support to the proposed model. Finally, to demonstrate its adaptability as new data further refines our understanding of H1 subtypes, we show how the model can be applied to experimental observations of telomeric heterochromatin in aging cells.

[Optimization of peptide-drug conjugates for targeted tumor therapy].||||||||In case of cancers with high mortality rate and lacking efficient medication there is a huge need of new, innovative treatments. Targeted tumor therapy, a real breakthrough in this field, is based on the concept that the antitumor agent is linked to a targeting molecule (e.g. peptide) specifically recognizing receptors or antigens that are tumor specific or overexpressed by tumor cells. The efficiency of this conjugate can be influenced by several factors. Among these, the structure of the targeting device, the type and number of the antitumor drug, its position in the conjugate and the chemical bonding of the drug to the targeting molecule are all important features that can determine receptor affinity and cellular uptake, and also the release and the cellular localization of the free drug or its active metabolite. Our goal in the framework of the grant NVKP_16-1-2016-0036 was to generate conjugates against cancers with high mortality rate. Through the below described studies, we introduce the course of the research process through which conjugates are optimized in order to develop more efficient drug candidates.

Accumulation of Innate Amyloid Beta Peptide in Glioblastoma Tumors.||||||||Immunostaining with specific antibodies has shown that innate amyloid beta (Aβ) is accumulated naturally in glioma tumors and nearby blood vessels in a mouse model of glioma. In immunofluorescence images, Aβ peptide coincides with glioma cells, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have shown that Aβ peptide is enriched in the membrane protein fraction of tumor cells. ELISAs have also confirmed that the Aβ(1-40) peptide is enriched in glioma tumor areas relative to healthy brain areas. Thioflavin staining revealed that at least some amyloid is present in glioma tumors in aggregated forms. We may suggest that the presence of aggregated amyloid in glioma tumors together with the presence of Aβ immunofluorescence coinciding with glioma cells and the nearby vasculature imply that the source of Aβ peptides in glioma can be systemic Aβ from blood vessels, but this question remains unresolved and needs additional studies.

Circular RNA Signature in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.||||||||Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in the world. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a new class of endogenous functional non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), and have been demonstrated to play important roles in the development of HCC. This study aimed to explore the significance of circRNAs in HCC progression. HCC-associated circRNA expression profiles GSE94508 and GSE97332 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO), and 87 differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs) between HCC tissues and paired non-cancer tissues were identified, including 76 up-regulated and 11 down-regulated circRNAs. Gene ontolog (GO) and pathway analyses of the host genes of these DECs suggested that these host genes were enriched in cell adhesion, cytosol, and protein binding, and were associated with tight junction and Wnt signaling pathways. CircRNA-miRNA interaction prediction identified 20 miRNAs that predispose to interact with DECs. Among these, four essential miRNAs, hsa-miR-7-5p, hsa-miR-145-5p, hsa-miR-203a-3p, and hsa-miR-192-5p, were reported to play pivotal roles in HCC progression by targeting multiple genes. Pathway analysis suggested that putative target genes of these essential miRNAs were involved in HCC-associated signaling pathways, such as Wnt, TGF-β, and Ras; whereas protein-protein network (PPI) analysis demonstrated that some validated target genes of these miRNAs, such as PIK3CA, AKT1, MYC, JUN, SMAD4, and SRC, were hub target genes as they have more counts of interacting protein. In the meantime, the deregulation of some DECs was validated in HCC cell line HepG2 compared with normal liver cell line L02 by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and the Sanger sequencing. This study identified a set of DECs in HCC, and provided a comprehensive understanding of the roles of these DECs in HCC progression.

Circular RNAs in drug resistant tumors.||||||||Chemotherapy is an effective method to treat patients with advanced malignant tumors. However, tumor cells can develop resistance to multiple drugs during the therapy process, leading to treatment failure. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a new class of regulatory RNAs that can regulate endogenous gene expression. Previous studies revealed the diagnostic and prognostic value of circRNAs in malignant cancer and other diseases, but few reports have examined their association with clinical drug resistance. In this review, we summarize the up-to-date information regarding the role of circRNAs in the resistance of tumors to chemotherapy and discuss specific regulatory mechanisms. This analysis is expected to provide direction for the prevention and management of drug resistance in tumors.

Circulating Tumor DNA and Hepatocellular Carcinoma.||||||||There is a clear and unmet need for biomarkers in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Circulating cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) is a fragmented DNA subtype, found in the blood circulation. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is the fraction of total cfDNA, which originates from the primary tumor or metastases in patients with cancer. Earlier studies reported that quantitative measurement cfDNA has diagnostic and prognostic role for HCC. More recently, improvement in next-generation sequencing technology and better understanding of genetic or epigenetic alteration of HCC have allowed comprehensive analysis of mutational and methylation landscape of ctDNA. Hotspot mutation panels and methylation panels have both shown promising performance. None of these tests have yet been validated in longitudinal cohorts for preclinical detection of HCC. In this article, the authors discuss the currently available ctDNA detection technologies, their diagnostic and prognostic performance in HCC, and future research directions.

Reactive oxygen species in status epilepticus.||||||||There has been growing evidence for a critical role of oxidative stress in neurodegenerative disease, providing novel targets for disease modifying treatments. Although antioxidants have been suggested and tried in the treatment of epilepsy, it is only recently that the pivotal role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of status epilepticus has been recognized. Although conventionally thought to be generated by mitochondria, reactive oxygen species during status epilepticus and prolonged seizure are generated mainly by NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase (stimulated by NMDA receptor activation). Excessive production of reactive oxygen species results in lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, enzyme inhibition, and mitochondrial damage, culminating in neuronal death. Antioxidant therapy has been hampered by poor CNS penetration and rapid consumption by oxidants. However, alternative approaches such as inhibiting NADPH oxidase or increasing endogenous antioxidant defenses through activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) could avoid these problems. Small molecules that increase Nrf2 activation have proven to be not only effective neuroprotectants following status epilepticus, but also potently antiepileptogenic. There are "Proceedings of the 7th London-Innsbruck Colloquium on Status Epilepticus and Acute Seizures".

A meta-analysis of zinc levels in breast cancer.||||||||Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring neoplasm in females, comprising 16% of all female cancers worldwide. Various studies indicate some discrepancies regarding zinc (Zn) levels in various samples of breast cancer patients.||||The present study evaluated by meta-analysed the published data for Zn levels analyzed in breast tissue, plasma, serum, and hair samples and its relationship with breast cancer.||||The present meta-analysis included 36 studies, all of which were published in the years between 1984 to 2017 and selected by searching the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Scopus, and the ISI Web of Knowledge. The articles were analyzed, and I² statistics were used to examine heterogeneity. The objective analysis was performed on data from the 36 studies, with total 1699 study subjects and 2009 controls.||||Significant statistical differences overall were observed, based on a random effects model (SMD (95 % CI), -0.78[-1.40, -0.16], P = 0.014). Data from 19 of these studies indicated significant statistical differences between cancerous patients and controls with regard to serum and plasma Zn concentration (SMD [(95 %CI): -1.61(-2.43, -0.79)]. There was a significant statistical difference between the breast tissue and hair as regards Zn status (SMD (95%CI): 2.32(1.42, 3.21)) and (SMD (95v%CI): -1.80(-3.41, -0.20), respectively. Zn concentration levels typically decreased in blood and hair samples of patients with breast cancer, whereas it was elevated in tumor tissues.||||There is a significant relationship between lowered serum Zn concentrations and risk of breast cancer onset or recurrences in women, but because of high heterogeneity, we recommend other primary studies.

Ibrutinib Plus Venetoclax in Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: The CLARITY Study.||||||||The treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been revolutionized by targeted therapies that either inhibit proliferation (ibrutinib) or reactivate apoptosis (venetoclax). Both significantly improve survival in CLL and replace chemoimmunotherapy for many patients. However, individually, they rarely lead to eradication of measurable residual disease (MRD) and usually are taken indefinitely or until progression. We present the CLARITY trial that combined ibrutinib with venetoclax to eradicate detectable CLL with the intention of stopping therapy.||||CLARITY is a phase II trial that combined ibrutinib with venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. The primary end point was eradication of MRD after 12 months of combined therapy. Key secondary end points were response by International Workshop on CLL criteria, safety, and progression-free and overall survival.||||In 53 patients after 12 months of ibrutinib plus venetoclax, MRD negativity (fewer than one CLL cell in 10,000 leukocytes) was achieved in the blood of 28 (53%) and the marrow of 19 (36%). Forty-seven patients (89%) responded, and 27 (51%) achieved a complete remission. After a median follow-up of 21.1 months, one patient progressed, and all patients were alive. A single case of biochemical tumor lysis syndrome was observed. Other adverse effects were mild and/or manageable and most commonly were neutropenia or GI events.||||The combination of ibrutinib plus venetoclax was well tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. There was a high rate of MRD eradication that led to the cessation of therapy in some patients. The progression-free and overall survival rates are encouraging for relapsed and refractory CLL.

Aberrant lipid metabolism as a therapeutic target in liver cancer.||||||||Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and lethal cancers. Progress has been made in treatment of HCC; however, improved outcomes are much needed. The increased metabolic needs of cancer cells underscore the importance of metabolic pathways in cancer cell survival. Lipid metabolism has a role in HCC development; aberrant overexpression of several key enzymes is seen in many solid human tumors. Areas covered: We discuss aberrant lipid metabolism and the promise of multiple targets, in particular related to HCC treatment. We searched PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov for published and unpublished studies from 2000 to 2019. These terms were used: lipids, fatty acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, liver cancer, HCC, de novo fatty acid synthesis, ATP citrate lyase, stearoyl CoA denaturase, fatty acid synthase, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, CD147, KLF4, monoglyceride lipase, AMP activated protein kinase. Expert opinion: The importance of dysregulation of fatty acid synthesis in cancer is a growing area of research. HCC demonstrates significant alteration in lipid metabolism, representing great potential as a target for novel therapeutics. Various agents have demonstrated promising anti-neoplastic activity. This strategy deserves further development for improved outcomes.

Alternative tumour-specific antigens.||||||||The study of tumour-specific antigens (TSAs) as targets for antitumour therapies has accelerated within the past decade. The most commonly studied class of TSAs are those derived from non-synonymous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), or SNV neoantigens. However, to increase the repertoire of available therapeutic TSA targets, 'alternative TSAs', defined here as high-specificity tumour antigens arising from non-SNV genomic sources, have recently been evaluated. Among these alternative TSAs are antigens derived from mutational frameshifts, splice variants, gene fusions, endogenous retroelements and other processes. Unlike the patient-specific nature of SNV neoantigens, some alternative TSAs may have the advantage of being widely shared by multiple tumours, allowing for universal, off-the-shelf therapies. In this Opinion article, we will outline the biology, available computational tools, preclinical and/or clinical studies and relevant cancers for each alternative TSA class, as well as discuss both current challenges preventing the therapeutic application of alternative TSAs and potential solutions to aid in their clinical translation.

Forty-four (% 89.8) of them were male. The mean age was 44.9. Twenty-eight patients (57.1%) had intersphincteric fistulas, while twenty-two patients (42.9%) had intersfinteric fistulas. Mean number of SNS application was 4.1 (1-6). Patients in Group 1 had mean number of SNS therapy as 3.42 (1-6), whereas cases in Group 2 this number was 5.5 (3-6). Patients were observed approximately for 8.84 months (6-12). We were able to reach sufficient healing in 13 (%26) cases via 2 times and 20 (%40) cases via 3-6 times application of SNS.||||We were able to reach complete healing rates as % 67 with SNS application in perianal fistula. This is a non-invasive procedure and could be applied in out patient clinics, with low costs. Less complication rates enhances attraction. Patients will not loose chance of surgical treatment. Therefore, we believe SNS may be used as first line treatment in perianal fistulas.||||Follow-up, Perianal fistula, Silver nitrate.

Gene Combination of CD44 rs187116, CD133 rs2240688, NF-κB1 rs28362491 and GSTM1 Deletion as a Potential Biomarker in Risk Prediction of Breast Cancer in Lower Northern Thailand.||||||||Background: Biomarkers play an important role in oncology, including risk assessment, treatment prediction, and||||monitoring the progression of disease. In breast cancer, many genes are used as biomarkers. Since, several SNP variations||||of hallmark – related genes have been reported to be of value in risk prediction in various cancers and populations, some||||genetic polymorphism loci were combined and reported as biomarkers for use in the risk assessment of breast cancer||||in Thai people. Methods: Twelve cancer gene hallmarks (15 polymorphic loci) were selected and genotyped in 184||||breast cancer patients and 176 healthy individuals in Phitsanulok, Thailand. Results: AA genotype of CD44 rs187116||||(c.67+4883G>A), the C allele of CD133 rs2240688 (c.*667A>C), the *2 allele (4 bp deletion) of NF-κB1 rs28362491||||and the homozygous null allele genotype of GSTM1 were significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer||||(p<0.05). A combination of these 4 significant loci showed that AA-AA-*1*1-homozygous null allele genotype has the||||greatest correlation with increased risk of breast cancer (OR = 21.00; 95% CI: 1.77 to 248.11; p = 0.015), followed by||||GA-AA-*2*2- homozygous null allele genotype (p = 0.037) and GG-AC-*1*2- homozygous null allele genotype (p||||= 0.028). Conclusion: These findings suggest that the polymorphisms of CD44 rs187116 (c.67+4883G>A), CD133||||rs2240688 (c.*667A>C), NF-κB1 rs28362491 and GSTM1 homozygous null allele genotype might be associated with||||an increased risk of breast cancer, and this gene combination could possibly be used as biomarkers for risk prediction,||||which would be of benefit in planning health surveillance and cancer prevention.

Glutamine Deprivation Induces PD-L1 Expression via Activation of EGFR/ERK/c-Jun Signaling in Renal Cancer.||||||||The programmed death-ligand 1/programmed death-1 (PD-L1/PD-1) pathway plays a pivotal role in the immune escape of tumors. Many tumor cells show "glutamine dependence." However, the relationship between glutamine metabolism and PD-L1 expression has not been reported. In this study, changes in PD-L1 expression in renal carcinoma cells were evaluated during glutamine deprivation and recovery. Although PD-L1 expression differed in two renal cancer cell lines, both cell lines upregulated PD-L1 during glutamine deprivation, and the upregulated PD-L1 was restored to normal after glutamine recovery. Mechanistically, glutamine deprivation resulted in activation of EGFR signaling via ERKs 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun. In addition, treatment of renal cancer cells with EGF also induced PD-L1 expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Finally, inhibitors of EGFR, ERK, and c-Jun all inhibited phosphorylation of c-Jun and downregulated PD-L1 expression induced by glutamine deprivation. Taken together, the data suggest that glutamine regulates the expression of PD-L1 through the EGFR/ERK/c-Jun pathway in renal cancer. IMPLICATIONS: This study reveals glutamine deprivation induces PD-L1 expression via activation of EGFR/ERK/c-Jun signaling in renal cancer and provides novel markers for the treatment of renal cancer.

Non-coding RNA in drug resistance of gastric cancer.||||||||Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The poorly prognosis and survival of GC are due to diagnose in an advanced, non-curable stage and with a limited response to chemotherapy. The acquisition of drug resistance accounts for the majority of therapy failure of chemotherapy in GC patients. Although the mechanisms of anticancer drug resistance have been broadly studied, the regulation of these mechanisms has not been completely understood. Accumulating evidence has recently highlighted the role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs, in the development and maintenance of drug resistance due to their regulatory features in specific genes involved in the chemoresistant phenotype of GC. We review the literature on ncRNAs in drug resistance of GC. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the ncRNAs' characteristics, their regulation of the genes involved in chemoresistance and their potential as targeted therapies for personalized treatment in resistant GC.

We investigated if 5-hmC profiles would serve as novel prognostic markers in neuroblastoma, a clinically heterogeneous pediatric cancer. Because this DNA modification facilitates active gene expression, we hypothesized that 5-hmC profiles would identify transcriptomic networks driving the clinical behavior of neuroblastoma.||||Nano-hmC-Seal sequencing was performed on DNA from Discovery (n = 51), Validation (n = 38), and Children's Oncology Group (n = 20) cohorts of neuroblastoma tumors. RNA was isolated from 48 tumors for RNA sequencing. Genes with differential 5-hmC or expression between clusters were identified using DESeq2. A 5-hmC model predicting outcome in high-risk patients was established using linear discriminant analysis.||||Comparison of low- versus high-risk tumors in the Discovery cohort revealed 577 genes with differential 5-hmC. Hierarchical clustering of tumors from the Discovery and Validation cohorts using these genes identified two main clusters highly associated with established prognostic markers, clinical risk group, and outcome. Genes with increased 5-hmC and expression in the favorable cluster were enriched for pathways of neuronal differentiation and KRAS activation, whereas genes involved in inflammation and the PRC2 complex were identified in the unfavorable cluster. The linear discriminant analysis model trained on high-risk Discovery cohort tumors was prognostic of outcome when applied to high-risk tumors from the Validation and Children's Oncology Group cohorts (hazard ratio, 3.8).||||5-hmC profiles may be optimal DNA-based biomarkers in neuroblastoma. Analysis of transcriptional networks regulated by these epigenomic modifications may lead to a deeper understanding of drivers of neuroblastoma phenotype.

Previous reports demonstrated that 2-aminoadipic acid (2-AAA), an intermediate metabolite of lysine metabolism, could modulate insulin secretion and predict T2D, suggesting the role of 2-AAA in glycolipid metabolism. Here, we showed that treatment of diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice with 2-AAA, significantly reduced body weight, decreased fat accumulation and lowered fasting glucose. Furthermore, Dhtkd1-/- mice, in which the substrate of DHTKD1 2-AAA increased to a significant high level, were resistant to DIO and obesity-related insulin resistance. Further study showed that 2-AAA induced higher energy expenditure due to increased adipocyte thermogenesis via up-regulating PGC1α and UCP1 mediated by β3AR activation, and stimulated lipolysis depending on enhanced expression of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) through activating β3AR signaling. Moreover, 2-AAA could alleviate the diabetic symptoms of db/db mice. Our data showed that 2-AAA played an important role in regulating glycolipid metabolism independent of diet and exercise, implying that improving the level of 2-AAA in vivo could be developed as a strategy in the treatment of obesity or diabetes.

As a result, this event was interpreted as a positive oral food challenge test. The infant resumed complete breastfeeding without the fortifier and has not relapsed since. Examination of his serial cytokine profiles from residual serum revealed that although interleukin-5 was not increased, interferon (IFN)-γ was increased, suggesting some relation between the time course of IFN-γ and the infant's eosinophil count. These findings may indicate that the involvement of IFN-γ is one cause of the onset of this disease.

However, the information on the anticancer activity of fucosterol against lung cancer as well as several other types of cancers is scantly.||||The present study was designed to investigate the anticancer activity of fucosterol against a panel of lung cancer cell lines.||||MTT and colony formation assays were used to determine the cell viability. DAPI and annexin V/PI staining assays were used for the detection of apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometery. Boyden chamber assay was used to monitor cell migration and western blot analysis was used to determine the protein expression. In vivo evaluation was carried out in xenografted mice models.||||). Moreover, fucosterol could also inhibit the invasion of A549 and SK-LU-1 cells. Finally fucosterol could also inhibit the growth of xenografted tumours in mice.||||Taken together, fucosterol inhibits the growth of lung cancer cells and may prove to be a lead molecule for the treatment of lung cancer.

Somatostatin in renal physiology and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.||||||||Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by progressive cyst formation, leading to growth in kidney volume and renal function decline. Although therapies have emerged, there is still an important unmet need for slowing the rate of disease progression in ADPKD. High intracellular levels of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) are involved in cell proliferation and fluid secretion, resulting in cyst formation. Somatostatin (SST), a hormone that is involved in many cell processes, has the ability to inhibit intracellular cAMP production. However, SST itself has limited therapeutic potential since it is rapidly eliminated in vivo. Therefore analogues have been synthesized, which have a longer half-life and may be promising agents in the treatment of ADPKD. This review provides an overview of the complex physiological effects of SST, in particular renal, and the potential therapeutic role of SST analogues in ADPKD.

Activity of hippocampal adult-born neurons regulates alcohol withdrawal seizures.||||||||Alcohol withdrawal (AW) after chronic alcohol exposure produces a series of symptoms, with AW-associated seizures being among the most serious and dangerous. However, the mechanism underlying AW seizures has yet to be established. In our mouse model, a sudden AW produced 2 waves of seizures: the first wave includes a surge of multiple seizures that occurs within hours to days of AW, and the second wave consists of sustained expression of epileptiform spikes and wave discharges (SWDs) during a protracted period of abstinence. We revealed that the structural and functional adaptations in newborn dentate granule cells (DGCs) in the hippocampus underlie the second wave of seizures but not the first wave. While the general morphology of newborn DGCs remained unchanged, AW increased the dendritic spine density of newborn DGCs, suggesting that AW induced synaptic connectivity of newborn DGCs with excitatory afferent neurons and enhanced excitability of newborn DGCs. Indeed, specific activation and suppression of newborn DGCs by the chemogenetic DREADD method increased and decreased the expression of epileptiform SWDs, respectively, during abstinence. Thus, our study unveiled that the pathological plasticity of hippocampal newborn DGCs underlies AW seizures during a protracted period of abstinence, providing critical insight into hippocampal neural circuits as a foundation to understand and treat AW seizures.

[Negative pressure pulmonary edema secondary to laryngospasm: a case report].||||||||Negative pressure pulmonary edema is a rare complication of general anesthesia. This paper presents a case of acute negative pressure pulmonary edema that occurred during general anesthesia resuscitation. The patient is a young male that underwent bimaxillary surgery under general anesthesia. Laryngospasm spasm ensued after extubation. The treatment for laryngeal spasm retained the smoothness of the nasopharyngal airway, and the pulse oxygen saturation rapidly decreased after anesthesia resuscitation. Pink foam sputum was sucked out from the cavity due to respiratory shortness from mouth and nose. Highly concentrated oxygen was immediately given to assist ventilation and as a symptomatic support (diuretics, hormones), and the condition evidently improved. The diagnosis and treatment of this case suggest that when acute pulmonary edema occurs during general anesthesia resuscitation, negative pressure pulmonary edema should be highly suspected. The first line of treatment is to relieve respiratory tract obstruction. Supplying highly concentrated oxygen to assist positive pressure ventilation is an effective treatment to alleviate pulmonary edema.

Transient left ventricular acute failure after Cocaine Use.||||||||Cocaine is one of the most widely used illicit drug, and it is the most common cause of drug-related death. The association of cocaine use with acute heart failure is a rare occurrence.||||We report the case of a 31 years-old woman who presented a Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with severe cardiogenic shock after cocaine abuse. That required the use of high doses of positive inotropic amines and mechanical ventilation. The evolution was quickly favorable after the cessation of cocaine Discussion:Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is often related to a stressful trigger, and several cases have been described with the use of several psychostimulants. As such, it is not surprising that cocaine use can be associated with the development of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy when it results in excess release of catecholamines and excitation of adrenergic receptors.||||In critical care unit, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a rare complication of cocaine abuse.This etiological diagnosis can be difficult especially in the absence of concept of toxic intake as it was initially the case for our patient, but the treatment does not differ from other causes of cardiomyopathy and Cessation of cocaine use has been associated with improvement in cardiac function.

Wntless promotes cellular viability and resistance to enzalutamide in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.||||||||De-regulation of Wnt signaling pathways has been shown to be associated with progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer and more recently, studies indicate that both canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways may mediate resistance to anti-androgen therapies such as enzalutamide. However, the mechanisms by which Wnt signaling is altered in prostate cancer remain poorly understood. Wnt pathway function begins with Wnt biogenesis and secretion from Wnt signal sending cells. While previous studies have investigated downstream mechanisms of Wnt pathway alterations in prostate cancer, little is known on the role of Wnt secretion mediating proteins. Wntless (WLS) is thought to be essential for the secretion of all Wnts. In this study, we sought to understand the role of WLS in prostate cancer.||||RNA-seq and gene set enrichment analysis were used to understand expression profile changes in enzalutamide-resistant C4-2B-MDVR (MDVR) cells versus parental C4-2B cells. Quantitative-PCR and western blot were used to confirm RNA-seq data and to assess expression changes of gene targets of interest. Rv1 cells were used as a separate model of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer. RNAi was used to inhibit WLS expression. Cell viability, colony formation, and PSA ELISA assays were used to assess cell growth and survival.||||Transcriptomic profiling revealed enriched Wnt pathway signatures in MDVR versus parental C4-2B cells. We further show that MDVR cells upregulate Wnt signaling and overexpress WLS. Inhibition of WLS decreases Wnt signaling, markedly attenuates prostate cancer cell viability, induces apoptosis, and re-sensitizes enzalutamide-resistant cells to enzalutamide treatment. Lastly, we show that inhibition of WLS reduces AR and AR-variants expression and downstream signaling.||||Our findings support a role for WLS in the progression of prostate cancer to a treatment-resistant state. Further efforts to understand Wnt signaling pathway alterations in this disease may lead to the development of novel treatments.

Development and body mass inversely affect children's brain activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during food choice.||||||||Childhood obesity is a rising problem caused in part by unhealthy food choices. Food choices are based on a neural value signal encoded in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and self-control involves modulation of this signal by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). We determined the effects of development, body mass (BMI Cole score) and body mass history on the neural correlates of healthy food choice in children. 141 children (aged 10-17y) from Germany, Hungary and Sweden were scanned with fMRI while performing a food choice task. Afterwards health and taste ratings of the foods were collected. In the food choice task children were asked to consider the healthiness or tastiness of the food or to choose naturally. Overall, children made healthier choices when asked to consider healthiness. However, children who had a higher weight gain per year chose less healthy foods when considering healthiness but not when choosing naturally. Pubertal development stage correlated positively while current body mass correlated negatively with dlPFC activation when accepting foods. Pubertal development negatively and current body mass positively influenced the effect of considering healthiness on activation of brain areas involved in salience and motivation. In conclusion, children in earlier stages of pubertal development and children with a higher body weight exhibited less activation in the dlPFC, which has been implicated in self-control during food choice. Furthermore, pubertal development and body mass influenced neural responses to a health cue in areas involved in salience and motivation. Thus, these findings suggest that children in earlier stages of pubertal development, children with a higher body mass gain and children with overweight may possibly be less susceptible to healthy eating interventions that rely on self-control or that highlight health aspects of food.

Consumption of black food decreases the risk of abdominal obesity in Korean women.||||||||The association between black-colored foods (black foods) such as black beans, known for their high antioxidant capacity, and the prevention of metabolic diseases has been explored, but not in a large population. Therefore, this study examined relationships between the consumption of black foods and metabolic syndrome in Korean adults.||||Data from 9,499 40-65-year old subjects (3,675 men and 5,824 women) from the 2010-2015 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used in the analysis. Black food consumption was estimated using 24-h dietary recall data, and analyses were performed according to black food consumer and non-consumer groups.||||The average total consumption of black foods was higher in women than men. The total black food consumer group in women had a 24% reduced risk of abdominal obesity than the non-consumer group (p=0.007). Furthermore, waist circumference decreased significantly with an increase in total black food consumption in women. High consumption of total black foods and black beans reduced the risk of abdominal obesity by 26% (p for trend=0.012) and 29% (p for trend=0.003) compared with no consumption. No risk factors for metabolic syndrome were associated with black food consumption in men.||||In conclusion, black foods, including black beans, may have beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome components, especially abdominal obesity.

Brainstem activity, apnea, and death during seizures induced by intrahippocampal kainic acid in anaesthetized rats.||||||||To investigate how prolonged seizure activity affects cardiorespiratory function and activity of pre-Bötzinger complex, leading to sudden death.||||Urethane-anesthetized female Long-Evans rats were implanted with nasal thermocouple; venous and arterial cannulae; and electrodes for electrocardiography (ECG) and hippocampal, cortical, and brainstem recording. Kainic acid injection into the ventral hippocampus induced status epilepticus.||||Seizures caused hypertension, tachycardia, and tachypnea punctuated by recurrent transient apneas. Salivation increased considerably: in 11 of 12 rats, liquid with alkaline pH consistent with saliva was expelled from the mouth. Most transient apneas were obstructive: nasal airflow ceased, while, in 83%, efforts to breathe persisted as continued rhythmic activity of respiratory pre-Bötzinger neurons, inspiratory electromyography (EMG), and excursions of the chest wall and abdomen. Blood pressure oscillated in time with respiratory efforts. This pattern also occurred in a minority of cases (16%) of incomplete apnea, but not in rare cases (1%) of transient central apneas. During transient obstructive apneas, the frequency of all inspiratory efforts decreased abruptly by ~30%, suggesting a resetting of the central respiratory rhythm generator. Twenty-two of thirty-one rats died, due either to obstructive apnea (12) or central apnea following progressive slowing of respiration (10). Most rats dying of central apnea had experienced several transient obstructive apneas. Negative DC field potential shifts of the brainstem followed the final breath, consistent with previous reports on spreading depolarization in mouse models. Timing suggests that the DC shift is a consequence rather than cause of respiratory collapse. Cardiac activity continued for tens of seconds.||||Seizure activity in forebrain induces pronounced autonomic activation and disrupts activity in medullary respiratory centers, resulting in death from either obstructive or central apnea. These results directly inform mechanisms of death in status epilepticus, and indirectly provide clues to mechanisms of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).

Lidocaine as treatment for neonatal seizures: evaluation of previously developed population pharmacokinetic models and dosing regimen.||||||||Lidocaine is used to treat neonatal seizures refractory to other anticonvulsants. It is effective, but also associated with cardiac toxicity. Previous studies have reported on the pharmacokinetics of lidocaine in preterm and term neonates and proposed a dosing regimen for effective and safe lidocaine use. The objective of this study was to evaluate the previously developed pharmacokinetic models and dosing regimen. As a secondary objective, lidocaine effectiveness and safety were assessed.||||Data from preterm neonates and (near-)term neonates with and without therapeutic hypothermia receiving lidocaine were included. Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed using non-linear mixed effects modelling. Simulations were performed to evaluate the proposed dosing regimen. Lidocaine was considered effective if no additional anticonvulsant was required and safe if no cardiac adverse events occurred.||||Data were available for 159 neonates; 50 (31.4%) preterm and 109 term neonates of whom 49 (30.8%) were treated with therapeutic hypothermia. Lidocaine clearance increased with postmenstrual age by 0.69%/day (95% CI 0.54% - 0.84%). During therapeutic hypothermia (33.5 °C), lidocaine clearance was reduced by 21.8% (7.26%/°C, 95% CI 1.63% - 11.2%) compared to normothermia (36.5 °C). Simulations demonstrated that the proposed dosing regimen leads to adequate average lidocaine plasma concentrations. Effectiveness and safety were assessed in 92 neonates. Overall effectiveness was 53.3% (49/92) and 56.5% (13/23) for neonates receiving the proposed dosing regimen. No cardiac toxicity was observed.||||Lidocaine pharmacokinetics was adequately described across the entire neonatal age range. With the proposed dosing regimen, lidocaine can provide effective and safe treatment for neonatal seizures.

The analgesic drug methadone is able to sensitize various tumors to chemotherapy. In this in vitro study, the influence of methadone to the effectiveness of ALA-PDT for SCC (FADU) and glioblastoma (A172) was investigated on the protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence, survival rates, apoptosis, and cell cycle phase, each with or without the presence of methadone. The production of PpIX was increased by methadone in FADU cells while it was decreased in A172 cells. The survival rates of both cell lines treated by ALA-PDT were significantly reduced by the combination with methadone (P < .05). Methadone also significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells and improved the effect of ALA-PDT on the cell cycle phase arrest in the G0/G1 phase (P < .05). This study demonstrates the potential of methadone to influence the cytotoxic effect of ALA-PDT for both SCC and glioblastoma cell lines.

Gender Related Changes in Gene Expression Induced by Valproic Acid in A Mouse Model of Autism and the Correction by S-adenosyl Methionine. Does It Explain the Gender Differences in Autistic Like Behavior?||||||||In previous studies we produced autism like behavioral changes in mice by Valproic acid (VPA) with significant differences between genders. S-adenosine methionine (SAM) prevented the autism like behavior in both genders. The expression of 770 genes of pathways involved in neurophysiology and neuropathology was studied in the prefrontal cortex of 60 days old male and female mice using the NanoString nCounter. In females, VPA induced statistically significant changes in the expression of 146 genes; 71 genes were upregulated and 75 downregulated. In males, VPA changed the expression of only 19 genes, 16 were upregulated and 3 downregulated. Eight genes were similarly changed in both genders. When considering only the genes that were changed by at least 50%, VPA changed the expression of 15 genes in females and 3 in males. Only Nts was similarly downregulated in both genders. SAM normalized the expression of most changed genes in both genders. We presume that genes that are involved in autism like behavior in our model were similarly changed in both genders and corrected by SAM. The behavioral and other differences between genders may be related to genes that were differently affected by VPA in males and females and/or differently affected by SAM.

Tamoxifen-induced acute eosinophilic pneumonia in a breast cancer patient.||||||||Tamoxifen is often used as antihormonal therapy in patients with breast cancer. However, it has various side effects, of which pneumonia is a rare occurrence.||||A 46-year-old female patient with breast cancer underwent surgical treatment. Tamoxifen was administered as adjuvant therapy on post-operative day 14; 2 days after administration of tamoxifen, the patient developed high fever of more than 39 °C and cough with dyspnea. Based on chest computed tomography findings of ground glass opacity, interlobular septal thickening, and mild pleural effusion in both lungs, eosinophilic pneumonia was suspected. Tamoxifen was discontinued and methylprednisolone injection was administered; the patient showed improvement of symptoms and radiographic findings.||||Tamoxifen was suspected as the cause of eosinophilic pneumonia since the patient developed high-grade fever at the time of tamoxifen administration, which subsided after discontinuation of the treatment. Other factors considered as the cause of pneumonia were examined, but all showed negative results. In order to confirm tamoxifen as the cause of pneumonia, tamoxifen treatment was restarted at follow-up (post-operative day 47); however, after 1 month, regular administration was not possible due to the development of itching symptom and difficulty in obtaining the patient's cooperation.||||The study highlights that if the patient on tamoxifen develops high fever and cough with dyspnea at 2-3days after the first administration, tamoxifen-induced pneumonia should be suspected.

A Sequential Target-Responsive Nanocarrier with Enhanced Tumor Penetration and Neighboring Effect In Vivo.||||||||Nanodrug-based cancer therapy is impeded by poor penetration into deep tumor tissues mainly due to the overexpression of hyaluronic acid (HA) in the tumor extracellular matrix (ECM). Although modification of nanoparticles (NPs) with hyaluronidase (HAase) is a potent strategy, it remains challenging to get a uniform distribution of drug at the tumor site because of the internalization of NPs by the cells in the tumor and HA regeneration. Herein, an intelligent nanocarrier, which can release HAase in response to the acidic tumor microenvironment (pH 6.5) and perform a strong neighboring effect with size reduction to overcome the above two problems and accomplish drug deep tumor penetration in vivo, is reported. In this design, HAase is encapsulated on the surfaces of doxorubicin (DOX) preloaded ZnO-DOX NPs using a charge convertible polymer PEG-PAH-DMMA (ZDHD). The polymer can release HAase to degrade HA in the tumor ECM (pH 6.5). ZnO-DOX NPs can release DOX in lysosomes (pH 4.5) to induce cell apoptosis, and exert a neighboring effect with size reduction to infect neighboring cells. The hierarchical targeted release of HAase and drugs is demonstrated to enhance tumor penetration and decrease side effects in vivo. This work shows promise for further application of ZDHD NPs in cancer therapy.

Compared to healthy dogs, dogs with HCC and benign liver diseases had significantly higher concentrations of glutamic acid by post hoc analysis. However, no significant difference in the PFAA profiles of HCC and benign liver diseases were detected. In addition, preoperative and postoperative PFAA profiles of dogs with HCC were not significantly different.||||Increased glutamic acid concentrations might play a role in the development or be a consequence of liver tumor formation. However, PFAA profiles of HCC could not be differentiated from those of benign lesions. In addition, glutamic acid concentrations did not change after surgical resection.

Significant random signatures reveals new biomarker for breast cancer.||||||||In 2012, Venet et al. proposed that at least in the case of breast cancer, most published signatures are not significantly more associated with outcome than randomly generated signatures. They suggested that nominal p-value is not a good estimator to show the significance of a signature. Therefore, one can reasonably postulate that some information might be present in such significant random signatures.||||In this research, first we show that, using an empirical p-value, these published signatures are more significant than their nominal p-values. In other words, the proposed empirical p-value can be considered as a complimentary criterion for nominal p-value to distinguish random signatures from significant ones. Secondly, we develop a novel computational method to extract information that are embedded within significant random signatures. In our method, a score is assigned to each gene based on the number of times it appears in significant random signatures. Then, these scores are diffused through a protein-protein interaction network and a permutation procedure is used to determine the genes with significant scores. The genes with significant scores are considered as the set of significant genes.||||First, we applied our method on the breast cancer dataset NKI to achieve a set of significant genes in breast cancer considering significant random signatures. Secondly, prognostic performance of the computed set of significant genes is evaluated using DMFS and RFS datasets. We have observed that the top ranked genes from this set can successfully separate patients with poor prognosis from those with good prognosis. Finally, we investigated the expression pattern of TAT, the first gene reported in our set, in malignant breast cancer vs. adjacent normal tissue and mammospheres.||||Applying the method, we found a set of significant genes in breast cancer, including TAT, a gene that has never been reported as an important gene in breast cancer. Our results show that the expression of TAT is repressed in tumors suggesting that this gene could act as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer and could be used as a new biomarker.

A novel urinary microRNA biomarker panel for detecting gastric cancer.||||||||Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common causes of cancer deaths worldwide; however, reliable and non-invasive screening methods for GC are not established. Therefore, we conducted this study to develop a biomarker for GC detection, consisting of urinary microRNAs (miRNAs).||||We matched 306 participants by age and sex [153 pairs consisting of patients with GC and healthy controls (HCs)], then randomly divided them across three groups: (1) the discovery cohort (4 pairs); (2) the training cohort (95 pairs); and (3) the validation cohort (54 pairs).||||There were 22 urinary miRNAs with significantly aberrant expressions between the two groups in the discovery cohort. Upon multivariate analysis of the training cohort, urinary expression levels of miR-6807-5p and miR-6856-5p were significantly independent biomarkers for diagnosis of GC, in addition to Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) status. A diagnostic panel that combined these 2 miRNAs and H. pylori status distinguished between HC and GC samples with an area under the curve (AUC) = 0.736. In the validation cohort, urinary miR-6807-5p and miR-6856-5p showed significantly higher expression levels in the GC group, and the combination biomarker panel of miR-6807-5p, miR-6856-5p, and H. pylori status also showed excellent performance (AUC = 0.885). In addition, this biomarker panel could distinguish between HC and stage I GC patients with an AUC = 0.748. Urinary expression levels of miR-6807-5p and miR-6856-5p significantly decreased to undetectable level after curative resection of GC.||||This novel biomarker panel enables early and non-invasive detection of GC.

Window of Opportunity trials for biomarker discovery in breast cancer.||||||||Window of Opportunity (WOO) studies have gain their place in current clinical and translational research in breast cancer patients. This review provides current information and future applications of this specific type of research.||||So far, WOO trials in breast cancer patients have demonstrated their utility in breast cancer research as: first they allow administering a treatment for a short period of time to treatment-naïve patients whose tumors have not developed mechanisms of resistance or heterogeneity because of previous therapies. Second, it brings a unique opportunity for translational research providing easy access to tumor tissue in order to evaluate antitumor effect from initial biopsy and from surgical resection specimen. They provide the perfect scenario for biomarker discovery and validation in an efficient and timely manner and valuable information about drug pharmacodynamics. Several issues need to be contemplated when designing and performing this type of trials including choice of a biological surrogate endpoint of efficacy as standard clinical activity endpoints are not feasible.||||Despite some limitations like the absence of information about secondary mechanisms of resistance, WOO trials represent an important support for drug development and biomarker discovery in breast cancer patients.

[Perspectives of improvement of the diagnosis of prostate cancer based on analysis of PCA3 gene expression].||||||||Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death. The widespread introduction into the clinical practice of test for prostate specific antigen (PSA) led to an increase in the number of prostate biopsies performed. At the same time, a decrease in the threshold of age-specific PSA standards has resulted in an increase in the number of unnecessary biopsies. In this regard, a need has arisen for new prostate cancer biomarkers. PCA3 is a non-coding mRNA that is exclusively expressed by prostate cells. Currently, three generations of test diagnostic systems based on the quantitative analysis of the PCA3 mRNA in the urine or its cell sediment has already developed, and they differ in the type of material studied and the method for estimating the amount of PCA3 mRNA. Clinical studies of the developed test systems have shown that a high level of PCA3 expression in the patients urine correlates with the probability of detecting prostate cancer. PCA3 test has higher positive and negative predictive values than previously used PSA test. These data are repeatedly confirmed by studies conducted in different clinics. Thus, the introduction of the method of quantitative determination of PCA3 in clinical practice can significantly improve the efficiency of diagnosis of prostate cancer and reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies.

Studies were collected after searching databases: PubMed and Google library. Additional search was performed through cross-check on the bibliography of selected articles. After the selection process made by two of the authors, articles which met the inclusion criteria were included in the review. Results revealed that circulating DNAs from blood, serum or plasma appear as favorable candidates as cancer biomarkers in patients suffering from oral cancer. The possibility to forecast recurrences and metastases through follow-up by quantification of candidate DNAs serve as another possible characteristic to be directed in forthcoming studies. However, methodological standardization and even sampling are required to increase the power and accuracy of results.

The expression was estimated usingreal time PCR and immunohistochemistry. Genomic instability was also calculated in the same study cohort using 8-OHdG assay, DNA fragmentation assay and comet assay. A significant downregulation of XRCC1 (p < 0.0001) and OGG1 (p < 0.0001) expression was observed in gastric cancer tumors vs controls. When analyzed with spearman correlation, significant positive correlation was observed between OGG1 vs XRCC1 (r = 0.319*, p < 0.02) and significant negative correlation was observed between OGG1 vs Ki-67 (r = -0.462**, p < 0.001) and XRCC1 vs Ki-67 (r = -0.589**, p < 0.001) in gastric cancer tumors. Significantly higher level of 8-OHdG, when compared to controls, was observed in gastric cancer tumors (p < 0.0001). DNA fragmentation assay and comet assay showed the formation of increased ladder patterns and comets in gastric cancer tumors when compared with controls These findings suggest that dysregulation of XRCC1, OGG1 combined with overexpression of Ki-67 may contribute to progression of gastric cancer and may help to sub-classify patients within diverse risk groups for therapeutic advantages.

Diversity of DNA Nanostructures and Applications in Oncotherapy.||||||||DNA nanotechnology is a new frontier in the field of tumor biotherapy. Simple DNA strands can be precisely constructed for integration into nanostructures of desired shapes and sizes, with excellent stability and biocompatibility. In this review, an account of the wide range of nanostructures composed of DNA sequences and related advances in oncotherapy using aptamers and chemical drugs is given. Functional ligands, including enzymes, antibodies, and agents, have been appended to DNA frameworks based on their external and internal modifiability. Hence, additional functionalities, such as immunogenicity and enzymatic activity, have been obtained, which extend their practical applications. Importantly, aptamers and drugs can be attached to or incorporated into the wireframes, bringing in highly selective targeting and killing abilities for the modified DNA nanostructures (DNs). In conclusion, distinct DNA sequences, various functional molecules, and different interactions and modifications lead to the diversity of DNs. Currently, one of the leading areas is their applications in tumor therapy. But beyond that, DNs should have much wider application prospects.

State-Level and County-Level Estimates of Health Care Costs Associated with Food Insecurity.||||||||Food insecurity, or uncertain access to food because of limited financial resources, is associated with higher health care expenditures. However, both food insecurity prevalence and health care spending vary widely in the United States. To inform public policy, we estimated state-level and county-level health care expenditures associated with food insecurity.||||We used linked 2011-2013 National Health Interview Survey/Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data (NHIS/MEPS) data to estimate average health care costs associated with food insecurity, Map the Meal Gap data to estimate state-level and county-level food insecurity prevalence (current though 2016), and Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care data to account for local variation in health care prices and intensity of use. We used targeted maximum likelihood estimation to estimate health care costs associated with food insecurity, separately for adults and children, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics.||||Among NHIS/MEPS participants, 10,054 adults and 3,871 children met inclusion criteria. Model estimates indicated that food insecure adults had annual health care expenditures that were $1,834 (95% confidence interval [CI], $1,073-$2,595, P < .001) higher than food secure adults. For children, estimates were $80 higher, but this finding was not significant (95% CI, -$171 to $329, P = .53). The median annual health care cost associated with food insecurity was $687,041,000 (25th percentile, $239,675,000; 75th percentile, $1,140,291,000). The median annual county-level health care cost associated with food insecurity was $4,433,000 (25th percentile, $1,774,000; 75th percentile, $11,267,000). Cost variability was related primarily to food insecurity prevalence.||||Health care expenditures associated with food insecurity vary substantially across states and counties. Food insecurity policies may be important mechanisms to contain health care expenditures.

Detection, pharmacokinetics, and selected pharmacodynamic effects of methamphetamine following a single transmucosal and intravenous administration to exercised Thoroughbred horses.||||||||Methamphetamine is a central and peripheral nervous system stimulant. There is only a single study that describes exposure to and disposition of this compound in horses. The potential for abuse and inadvertent exposure in equine athletes along with the limited data available necessitates further study. The objectives of the current study were to describe drug and metabolite concentrations, develop an analytical method that could be used to regulate its use, and describe selected pharmacodynamic effects. In phase 1, six horses were randomized into three transmucosal dose groups (n = 2/group; 0.5, 1.0 or 10 mg). In phase 2, horses received a single 10 mg intravenous dose. In phase 3, the effects of urinary pH on elimination were studied. Blood and urine samples were collected for up to 72 hours post drug administration. Concentrations of methamphetamine were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Methamphetamine was below the limit of detection (LOD) in blood by 2, 4, and 18 hours following transmucosal administration of 0.5, 1, and 10 mg, respectively. Following intravenous administration, methamphetamine fell below the LOD between 12 and 18 hours. Following urinary acidification, methamphetamine fell below the limit of quantitation (LOQ) by 12 hours. In urine, methamphetamine was no longer detected at 48, 48, and 72 hours in the 0.5, 1, and 10 mg transmucosal groups and 18 hours in the intravenous group. Increased urinary pH resulted in urinary concentrations of methamphetamine falling below detectable levels by 48 hours post transmucosal administration. While the number of animals was small, behavioral, stimulatory, and cardiac effects were minimal.

Integrative molecular analysis of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.||||||||Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the major type of primary liver cancer. Intrahepatic metastasis, such as portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT), strongly indicates poor prognosis of HCC. But now, there are limited understandings of the molecular features and mechanisms of those metastatic HCCs.||||To characterize the molecular alterations of the metastatic HCCs, we implemented an integrative analysis of the copy number variations (CNVs), DNA methylations and transcriptomes of matched adjacent normal, primary tumor and PVTT samples from 19 HCC patients.||||CNV analysis identified a frequently amplified focal region chr11q13.3 and a novel deletion peak chr19q13.41 containing three miRNAs. The integrative analysis with RNA-seq data suggests that CNVs and differential promoter methylations regulate distinct oncogenic processes. Then, we used individualized differential analysis to identify the differentially expressed genes between matched primary tumor and PVTT of each patient. Results show that 5 out of 19 studied patients acquire evidential progressive alterations of gene expressions (more than 1000 differentially expressed genes were identified in each patient). While, another subset of eight patients have nearly identical gene expressions between the corresponding matched primary tumor and PVTT. Twenty genes were found to be recurrently and progressively differentially expressed in multiple patients. These genes are mainly associated with focal adhesion, xenobiotics metabolism by cytochrome P450 and amino acid metabolism. For several differentially expressed genes in metabolic pathways, their expressions are significantly associated with overall survivals and vascular invasions of HCC patients.

A four-mRNA model to improve the prediction of breast cancer prognosis.||||||||Breast cancer (BRCA) is the most prevalent cancer that threatens female health. A growing body of evidence has demonstrated the non-negligible effects of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) on biological processes involved in cancers; however, there is no definite conclusion regarding the role of mRNAs in predicting the prognosis of BRCA patients.||||We systematically screened the mRNA expression landscape and clinical data of samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Univariate Cox analysis and robust likelihood-based survival analysis were conducted to identify key mRNAs associated with BRCA. Furthermore, risk scores based on multivariate Cox analysis divided the training set into high-risk and low-risk groups. ROC analysis determined the optimal cut-off point for patient classification of risk levels. The prognostic model was additionally validated in the testing set and complete dataset. Finally, we plotted the survival curves for the mRNAs used in our model.||||We obtained the original expression data of 13,617 mRNAs from a total of 1088 samples. After comprehensive survival analysis, the four-mRNA (ACSL1, OTUD3, PKD1L2, and WISP1) prognosis risk assessment model was constructed. Furthermore, the area under cure (AUC) was 0.834, indicating that the model was meaningful and reasonable. In each dataset, analysis based on the four-mRNA signature risk score indicated that the survival status of the group with high risk score was worse than that of the group with low risk scores. Patients with strong mRNA expression of OTUD3, PKD1L2, and WISP1 tended to have good prognosis, whereas patients with high ACSL1 expression tended to have poor prognosis.||||In summary, we constructed a four-mRNA prognosis risk assessment model for BRCA. The newly developed model offers more possibilities for assessing prognosis and guiding the selection of better treatment strategies for BRCA.

Proteins have different orientations and function in different tissues. The same protein, located in different subcellular regions, can perform different and even opposite functions. Both functional and structural proteins are capable of undergoing re-localization which can directly or indirectly participate in signal transduction. Due to abnormal transduction of signals during carcinogenesis, the proteins originally expressed in the cytoplasm are translocated into the nucleus and lead to functional changes in the tumor tissue. The changes of protein localization are affected by many factors, including the interaction between proteins, expression level of proteins and the cleaved intracellular domain of transmembrane protein.

Long noncoding RNA HULC promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression.||||||||. Our mechanistic studies showed that HULC works as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-2052, and that the MET receptor tyrosine kinase is a downstream target of miR-2052 in HCC. Furthermore, HULC inhibits miR-2052, thereby stimulating MET expression in HCC. Finally, MET overexpression reverses the effects of HULC depletion. In sum, our findings reveal a novel regulatory signaling cascade, the HULC/miR-2052/MET axis, which could potentially be exploited for therapeutic benefits in the treatment of HCC.

Dysregulated circRNAs serve as prognostic and diagnostic markers in osteosarcoma by sponging microRNA to regulate the downstream signaling pathway.||||||||Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been extensively studied in many tumors. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the relationship between circRNAs and clinical features, prognosis, and diagnosis of osteosarcoma patients. We mainly included studies about circRNAs expression and osteosarcoma. The odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used for clinical features, sensitivity, and specificity, while the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were used to assess overall survival (OS). A number of 13 articles were included in this study, including 9 about clinical features, 11 about prognosis, and 5 about diagnosis. The results showed that increased circRNAs expression was significantly correlated with adverse clinical characteristics. In terms of prognosis, oncogenic circRNAs had adverse effects on overall survival (OS: HR = 2.54; 95%Cl: 2.05-3.03), and increased expression of cancer-suppressor circRNAs prolonged survival (OS: HR = 0.42; 95%Cl: 0.210.64). Our study further showed an AUC of 0.85, with an 80% sensitivity and 77% specificity to distinguish osteosarcoma patients from healthy controls. In conclusion, circRNAs may be new promising indicators for prognostic evaluation and early diagnosis of osteosarcoma patients.

Identification of differentially expressed circRNAs and a novel hsa_circ_0000144 that promote tumor growth in gastric cancer.||||||||Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in regulating tumor pathogenesis. The mechanism of circRNAs in gastric cancer (GC) is still unknown. Our study aimed to identify differentially expressed circRNAs and assess a novel circRNA (hsa_circ_0000144) in the proliferation, migration, and invasion in GC.||||Gene ontology (GO) enrichment and analyses of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, pathway network, and the ceRNA regulatory network of hsa_circ_0000144 targeting miRNAs and mRNAs were performed with the help of bioinformatics using R language and Perl software. hsa_circ_0000144 expression and circRNA knockdown in GC cell lines were detected using quantitative PCR (qPCR) in vitro. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion after circRNA knockdown were measured using the cell counting kit-8 assay and Transwell assay.||||The circRNA expression profile GSE78092 downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database included three GC patients and three normal tissues. Thirty-two differentially expressed circRNAs comprised six upregulated circRNAs and 26 downregulated circRNAs. In particular, the ErbB signaling pathway, neurotrophin signaling pathway, cellular senescence, and pathways in bladder cancer and GC played the most important roles in the pathway network. The expression of hsa_circ_0000144 was upregulated in GC cell lines. Hsa_circ_0000144 knockdown suppressed tumor growth in vitro.||||Hsa_circ_0000144 promotes GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and the ceRNA regulatory network of hsa_circ_0000144 targeting miRNAs and mRNAs might be biomarkers for GC diagnosis and targeted therapy.

The Difference of Expression of 18 Genes in Axillary Invasion and Vascular Invasion Compared to Control Samples in Breast Cancer.||||||||Recent studies from gene profiling have revealed some genes that are overexpressed in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and are responsible for its initiation and activation resulting in tumor progression and metastasis. The present study aimed to assess the role of genes involved in the EMT process and the association of these genes with axillary lymph node and vascular invasion in breast cancer (BC) patients.||||In this case-control study, the tumor samples were initially extracted from 33 BC patients.

Role of circular RNAs in gastric cancer: Recent advances and prospects.||||||||Circular RNA (circRNA) is a newly discovered non-coding RNA with special structure, which is widely expressed in eukaryotic organisms and mainly located in the cytoplasm. circRNAs participate in gene regulation by working as miRNA sponges that block the inhibitory effect of miRNA on its target genes. In addition, circRNAs can bind to RNA binding proteins to regulate gene expression. Based on characteristics of stability, expression specificity and participation in gene regulation, circRNAs are expected to be biomarkers for early diagnosis of cancer or potential targets for cancer therapy. With the help of bioinformatics analysis, circRNA microarray analysis and high-throughput sequencing technology, more circRNAs were discovered to participate in the progression of gastric cancer (GC) over the past three years. This article gives an overview of these recent research focusing on the roles of circRNAs in GC and highlights the advances.

Structure, Antioxidant, and Hypoglycemic Activities of Arabinoxylans Extracted by Multiple Methods from Triticale.||||||||Different methods of isolating arabinoxylans (AXs) from triticale were performed to investigate the extraction methods' effects on the physiological functions of the AXs. Structural, antioxidant, and hypoglycemic activities were determined. The molecular weights (MWs) of enzyme- or water-extracted AXs were lower than those of alkali-extracted AXs. Opposite trends were shown by the arabinose-xylose ratio. Enzyme-extracted AXs exhibited higher glucose adsorption capacity and hydroxyl radical-scavenging efficiency than alkali-extracted AXs. The α-amylase inhibition ability, DPPH radical-scavenging capacity, and metal-chelating activity of alkali-extracted AXs were higher than those of enzyme-extracted AXs. Water-extracted AXs had the highest glucose dialysis retardation index. In conclusion, extraction methods can influence the physiological function of AXs through their structural features. AXs with higher MWs and esterified ferulic acid (FA) levels had higher antioxidant ability, whereas AXs with higher solubility and free FA level exhibited higher hypoglycemic activity.

Gastric cancer: epidemiology, biology, and prevention: a mini review.||||||||Gastric cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The objective of this article is to review the epidemiology and biology of gastric cancer risk. This literature review explores the biological, clinical, and environmental factors that influence the rates of this disease and discuss the different intervention methods that may not only increase the awareness of gastric cancer but also increase screening in efforts to reduce the risk of gastric cancer. Helicobacter pylori infection is the primary risk factor for gastric cancer. Additional risk factors include geographical location, age, sex, smoking, socioeconomic status, dietary intake, and genetics. Primary and secondary prevention strategies such as dietary modifications and screenings are important measures for reducing the risk of gastric cancer. Interventions, such as H. pylori eradication through chemoprevention trials, have shown some potential as a preventative strategy. Although knowledge about gastric cancer risk has greatly increased, future research is warranted on the differentiation of gastric cancer epidemiology by subsite and exploring the interactions between H. pylori infection, genetics, and environmental factors. Better understanding of these relationships can help researchers determine the most effective intervention strategies for reducing the risk of this disease.

Additional studies included analysis of potential cross-reactivity with other mGluRs, expression of mGluR2 in patients' tumors, and the effects of mGluR2-Abs on cultures of rat hippocampal neurons.||||Patient 1 was a 78-year-old woman with progressive cerebellar ataxia with an initial relapsing-remitting course who developed a small-cell tumor of unknown origin. Patient 2 was a 3-year-old girl who presented a steroid-responsive acute cerebellitis preceding the diagnosis of an alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Patients' serum and CSF showed a characteristic immunostaining of the hippocampus and cerebellum in rat brain sections and immunolabeled the cell surface of live rat hippocampal neurons. HEK293 cells transfected with mGluR1, 2, 3, and 5 confirmed that patients' antibodies only recognized mGluR2. mGluR2-Abs were not detected in 160 controls, 120 with paraneoplastic, autoimmune, or degenerative ataxias, and 40 with autoimmune encephalitis and antibodies against mGluR5 or unknown antigens. Expression of mGluR2 in tumors was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using a commercial mGluR2-Ab. Incubation of live rat hippocampal neurons with CSF of patient 2 did not modify the density of surface mGluR2 clusters.||||mGluR2-Abs are a novel biomarker of paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia. The potential pathogenic effect of the antibodies is not mediated by downregulation or internalization of neuronal surface mGluR2.

The purpose of the present study is to investigate the function of TUC338 in bladder cancer. We found that TUC338 was upregulated in early-stage bladder cancer patients and showed early diagnostic values. After surgical resection, plasma levels of TUC338 were significantly downregulated. Moreover, microRNA 10b (miR-10b) was also upregulated in bladder cancer patients. TUC338 and miR-10b were positive and significantly correlated in bladder cancer patients, but not in healthy controls. Bladder cancer cells with TUC338 overexpression showed upregulated miR-10b, while miR-10b overexpression failed to significantly affect TUC338. TUC338 and miR-10b overexpression significantly promoted bladder cancer cell invasion and migration. Therefore, TUC338 may promote bladder cancer at least partially by upregulating miR-10b.

A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) and B cell activating factor (BAFF) are important factors in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and prognosis of systemic B cell malignancies. However, their utility as biomarkers for the diagnosis of CNSL and their effects on CNSL cells remain unclear.||||In this prospective study, we analyzed the levels of APRIL and BAFF in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 116 patients with suspected focal brain lesions, including 53 CNSL patients. Additionally, we serially measured their levels during chemotherapy and relapse. Furthermore, we analyzed the effect of APRIL and BAFF on two B cell lymphoma cell lines using proliferation, viability, and chemotaxis assays.||||CSF levels of APRIL and BAFF reliably differentiated CNSL from other focal brain lesions (including primary and metastatic brain tumors, autoimmune-inflammatory lesions, and neuroinfectious lesions) with a specificity of 93.7% (APRIL, BAFF) and a sensitivity of 62.3% (APRIL) and 47.1% (BAFF). Serial CSF analysis of CNSL patients during chemotherapy and relapse demonstrates a close correlation of APRIL CSF levels and the course of this disease. In vitro, APRIL and BAFF showed anti-apoptotic effects during MTX treatment and mediated chemotaxis of malignant B cells.||||This study extends the spectrum of valuable diagnostic biomarkers in CNSL. In patients with focal brain lesions, measurement of APRIL in CSF could help accelerating the diagnosis of CNSL. Moreover, our results highlight an important role of APRIL and BAFF in the pathophysiology of CNSL.

How liquid biopsies can change clinical practice in oncology.||||||||Cell-free DNA fragments are shed into the bloodstream by tumor cells. The analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), commonly known as liquid biopsy, can be exploited for a variety of clinical applications. ctDNA is being used to genotype solid cancers non-invasively, to track tumor dynamics and to detect the emergence of drug resistance. In a few settings, liquid biopsies have already entered clinical practice. For example, ctDNA is used to guide treatment in a subset of lung cancers. In this review, we discuss how recent improvements in the sensitivity and accuracy of ctDNA analyses have led to unprecedented advances in this research field. We further consider what is required for the routine deployment of liquid biopsies in the clinical diagnostic space. We pinpoint technical hurdles that liquid biopsies have yet to overcome, including preanalytical and analytical challenges. We foresee how liquid biopsies will transform clinical practice: by complementing (or replacing) imaging to monitor treatment response and by detecting minimal residual disease after surgery with curative intent.

A global analysis was much needed within this context to distinguish the most significant repeats from more than a thousand repeat motifs. Utilising a previously presented RNA-seq dataset, we studied expression changes of all repeats in ER+/HER2- human breast tumour samples obtained from 22 patients in comparison to matched normal tissues. Fifty six (56) repeat subtypes including satellites and transposons were found to be differentially expressed and most of them were novel for breast cancer. HERVKC4-int and HERV1_LTRc, whose expressions correlated well with that of the estrogen receptor gene ESR1, were upregulated at the highest level. REP522 and D20S16 satellites were also significantly upregulated along with insignificant increases in the expressions of other satellites including HSATI and BSR/beta. Interestingly, expressions of REP522 and D20S16 correlated with many key breast cancer pathway (e.g. BRCA1, BRCA2, AKT1, MTOR, KRAS) and survival genes; possibly highlighting their importance in the carcinogenesis of breast. Additional differentially expressed elements such as L1P and various MER transposons also exhibited a similar pattern. Finally, our repeat enrichment analysis on the promoters of differentially expressed genes revealed further links between additional repeats and nearby genes.

[Optimization of peptide-drug conjugates for targeted tumor therapy].||||||||In case of cancers with high mortality rate and lacking efficient medication there is a huge need of new, innovative treatments. Targeted tumor therapy, a real breakthrough in this field, is based on the concept that the antitumor agent is linked to a targeting molecule (e.g. peptide) specifically recognizing receptors or antigens that are tumor specific or overexpressed by tumor cells. The efficiency of this conjugate can be influenced by several factors. Among these, the structure of the targeting device, the type and number of the antitumor drug, its position in the conjugate and the chemical bonding of the drug to the targeting molecule are all important features that can determine receptor affinity and cellular uptake, and also the release and the cellular localization of the free drug or its active metabolite. Our goal in the framework of the grant NVKP_16-1-2016-0036 was to generate conjugates against cancers with high mortality rate.

Genomic signatures defining responsiveness to allopurinol and combination therapy for lung cancer identified by systems therapeutics analyses.||||||||The ability to predict responsiveness to drugs in individual patients is limited. We hypothesized that integrating molecular information from databases would yield predictions that could be experimentally tested to develop transcriptomic signatures for specific drugs. We analyzed lung adenocarcinoma patient data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and identified a subset of patients in which xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) expression correlated with decreased survival. We tested allopurinol, an FDA-approved drug that inhibits XDH, on human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines obtained from the Broad Institute Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and identified sensitive and resistant cell lines. We utilized the transcriptomic profiles of these cell lines to identify six-gene signatures for allopurinol-sensitive and allopurinol-resistant cell lines. Transcriptomic networks identified JAK2 as an additional target in allopurinol-resistant lines. Treatment of resistant cell lines with allopurinol and CEP-33779 (a JAK2 inhibitor) resulted in cell death. The effectiveness of allopurinol alone or allopurinol and CEP-33779 was verified in vivo using tumor formation in NCR-nude mice. We utilized the six-gene signatures to predict five additional allopurinol-sensitive NSCLC cell lines and four allopurinol-resistant cell lines susceptible to combination therapy. We searched the transcriptomic data from a library of patient-derived NSCLC tumors from the Jackson Laboratory to identify tumors that would be predicted to be sensitive to allopurinol or allopurinol + CEP-33779 treatment. Patient-derived tumors showed the predicted drug sensitivity in vivo. These data indicate that we can use integrated molecular information from cancer databases to predict drug responsiveness in individual patients and thus enable precision medicine.

PMID:31291309	drug	CHEBI:23888	[[5..9]]	tumor	HP:0002664	[[53..58]]	null	70	N	Both drug delivery systems showed anti-mammary gland tumor properties.	Enhanced anti-mammary gland cancer activities of tamoxifen-loaded erythropoietin-coated drug delivery system.||||||||Nanomedicine is an emerging area in the medical field, particularly in the treatment of cancers. Nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) was shown to be a good nanoparticulated carrier for the delivery of tamoxifen (TAM). In this study, the tamoxifen-loaded erythropoietin-coated nanostructured lipid carriers (EPO-TAMNLC) were developed to enhance the anti-cancer properties and targetability of TAM, using EPO as the homing ligand for EPO receptors (EpoRs) on breast cancer tissue cells. Tamoxifen-loaded NLC (TAMNLC) was used for comparison. The LA7 cells and LA7 cell-induced rat mammary gland tumor were used as models in the study. Immunocytochemistry staining showed that LA7 cells express estrogen receptors (ERs) and EpoRs. EPO-TAMNLC and TAMNLC significantly (p<0.05) inhibited proliferation of LA7 in dose- and time-dependent manner. EPO-TAMNLC induced apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest of LA7 cells. Both drug delivery systems showed anti-mammary gland tumor properties. At an intravenous dose of 5 mg kg-1 body weight, EPO-TAMNLC and TAMNLC were not toxic to rats, suggesting that both are safe therapeutic compounds. In conclusion, EPO-TAMNLC is not only a unique drug delivery system because of the dual drug-loading feature, but also potentially highly specific in the targeting of breast cancer tissues positive for ERs and EpoRs. The incorporation of TAM into NLC with and without EPO coat had significantly (p<0.05) improved specificity and safety of the drug carriers in the treatment of mammary gland tumors.

Obese mice exposed to psychosocial stress display cardiac and hippocampal dysfunction associated with local brain-derived neurotrophic factor depletion.||||||||Obesity and psychosocial stress (PS) co-exist in individuals of Western society. Nevertheless, how PS impacts cardiac and hippocampal phenotype in obese subjects is still unknown. Nor is it clear whether changes in local brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) account, at least in part, for myocardial and behavioral abnormalities in obese experiencing PS.||||In adult male WT mice, obesity was induced via a high-fat diet (HFD). The resident-intruder paradigm was superimposed to trigger PS. In vivo left ventricular (LV) performance was evaluated by echocardiography and pressure-volume loops. Behaviour was indagated by elevated plus maze (EPM) and Y-maze. LV myocardium was assayed for apoptosis, fibrosis, vessel density and oxidative stress. Hippocampus was analyzed for volume, neurogenesis, GABAergic markers and astrogliosis. Cardiac and hippocampal BDNF and TrkB levels were measured by ELISA and WB. We investigated the pathogenetic role played by BDNF signaling in additional cardiac-selective TrkB (cTrkB) KO mice.||||When combined, obesity and PS jeopardized LV performance, causing prominent apoptosis, fibrosis, oxidative stress and remodeling of the larger coronary branches, along with lower BDNF and TrkB levels. HFD/PS weakened LV function similarly in WT and cTrkB KO mice. The latter exhibited elevated LV ROS emission already at baseline. Obesity/PS augmented anxiety-like behaviour and impaired spatial memory. These changes were coupled to reduced hippocampal volume, neurogenesis, local BDNF and TrkB content and augmented astrogliosis.||||PS and obesity synergistically deteriorate myocardial structure and function by depleting cardiac BDNF/TrkB content, leading to augmented oxidative stress. This comorbidity triggers behavioral deficits and induces hippocampal remodeling, potentially via lower BDNF and TrkB levels.

Diagnosing Metabolic Syndrome in Craniopharyngioma Patients: Body Composition versus BMI.||||||||Craniopharyngioma patients often have poor metabolic profiles due to hypothalamic-pituitary damage. Previously, using body mass index (BMI) as obesity marker, the occurrence of the metabolic syndrome in these patients was estimated at 46%. Our aim was to determine if Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA-) scan in evaluation of obesity and metabolic syndrome would be superior.||||Retrospective study of craniopharyngioma patients for whom DXA-scan results were available.||||BMI, fat percentage and fat mass index were used to evaluate obesity and as components for obesity in metabolic syndrome.||||Ninety-five craniopharyngioma patients were included (51% female, 49% childhood-onset disease). Metabolic syndrome occurred in 34-53 (45-51%) subjects (depending on the definition of obesity, although all definitions occurred in higher frequency than in the general population). Metabolic syndrome frequency was higher if obesity was defined by fat percentage (52% vs. 42%) or fat mass index (51% vs. 43%) compared to BMI. Misclassification appeared in 9% (fat percentage vs. BMI) and 7% (fat mass index vs. BMI) for metabolic syndrome and 29% and 13% for obesity itself, respectively. For metabolic syndrome, almost perfect agreement was found for BMI compared with fat percentage or fat mass index. For obesity, agreement was fair to moderate (BMI vs. fat percentage).||||Using BMI to evaluate obesity underestimates the true prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with craniopharyngioma. Furthermore, fat percentage contributes to a better evaluation of obesity than BMI. The contribution of DXA-scan might be limited for identification of the metabolic syndrome.

The patient was diagnosed as skin disease.||||Histopathologic examination revealed a pancreatic glucagonoma. Immnohistochemical staining of tumor tissue was positive for glucagon.||||The distal pancreatectomy plus splenectomy was performed in 2017.||||The skin lesions disappeared after surgery. She was followed up and showed no recurrence until now.||||Clinicians should consider the diagnosis of glucagonoma according to the typical initial symptoms. Early diagnosis is very important to provide a better prognosis. A multidisciplinary approach is effective in patients with unresectable metastatic tumors.

Canine adrenocorticotropic hormone-producing sinusoidal neuroendocrine tumor associated with Cushing's disease.||||||||An 18-year-old male Yorkshire Terrier was admitted with a history of neurological signs including dullness and progressive tetraparesis. Physical examination revealed bilaterally symmetrical alopecia and pot-bellied abdomen. Computed tomography and necropsy examination showed a mass across the frontal sinus and cerebral frontal lobe, bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia, and hepatomegaly. Histopathologically, the tumor lesions consisted of sheets, nests, or cords of small- to medium-sized round-to-polyhedral cells. Adrenal cortex showed bilateral diffuse cellular proliferation, and some hepatocytes showed intracytoplasmic glycogen accumulation. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for pancytokeratin, chromogranin-A, neuron-specific enolase, S100, synaptophysin, and thyroid transcription factor-1 but negative for microtubule-associated proein-2 and neurofilament, leading to the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumor.

Involvement of hydrogen sulfide in the progression of renal fibrosis.||||||||Renal fibrosis is the most common manifestation of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Noting that existing treatments of renal fibrosis only slow disease progression but do not cure it, there is an urgent need to identify novel therapies. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a newly discovered endogenous small gas signaling molecule exerting a wide range of biologic actions in our body. This review illustrates recent experimental findings on the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of H2S against renal fibrosis and highlights its potential in future clinical application.||||Literature was collected from PubMed until February 2019, using the search terms including "Hydrogen sulfide," "Chronic kidney disease," "Renal interstitial fibrosis," "Kidney disease," "Inflammation factor," "Oxidative stress," "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition," "H2S donor," "Hypertensive kidney dysfunction," "Myofibroblasts," "Vascular remodeling," "transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta/Smads signaling," and "Sulfate potassium channels."||||Literature was mainly derived from English articles or articles that could be obtained with English abstracts. Article type was not limited. References were also identified from the bibliographies of identified articles and the authors' files.||||The experimental data confirmed that H2S is widely involved in various renal pathologies by suppressing inflammation and oxidative stress, inhibiting the activation of fibrosis-related cells and their cytokine expression, ameliorating vascular remodeling and high blood pressure, stimulating tubular cell regeneration, as well as reducing apoptosis, autophagy, and hypertrophy. Therefore, H2S represents an alternative or additional therapeutic approach for renal fibrosis.||||We postulate that H2S may delay the occurrence and progress of renal fibrosis, thus protecting renal function. Further experiments are required to explore the precise role of H2S in renal fibrosis and its application in clinical treatment.

Aim of this study was to evaluate the potential utility of lncRNAs in constructing lncRNA-based classifiers of BLCA prognosis and recurrence. Based on the data concerning BLCA retrieved from TCGA, lncRNA-based classifiers for OS and RFS were built using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operation (LASSO) Cox regression model in the training cohorts. More specifically, a 14-lncRNA-based classifier for OS and a 12-lncRNA-based classifier for RFS were constructed using the LASSO Cox regression. According to the prediction value, patients were divided into high/low-risk groups based on the cut-off of the median risk-score. The log-rank test showed significant differences in OS and RFS between low- and high-risk groups in the training, validation and whole cohorts. In the time-dependent ROC curve analysis, the AUCs for OS in the first, third, and fifth year were 0.734, 0.78, and 0.78 respectively, whereas the prediction capability of the 14-lncRNA classifier was superior to a previously published lncRNA classifier. As for the RFS, the AUCs in the first, third, and fifth year were 0.755, 0.715, and 0.740 respectively. In summary, the two-lncRNA-based classifiers could serve as novel and independent prognostic factors for OS and RFS individually.

Plasma-free amino acid profiles in dogs with hepatocellular carcinoma.||||||||Metabolomic analysis using blood samples has been suggested to be useful for the early detection of cancer. Among metabolites, plasma-free amino acid (PFAA) profiles are potential diagnostic biomarkers for several diseases including cancer. However, the relationship between PFAA concentrations and liver tumors in dogs remains unknown.||||To determine the characteristics of PFAA profiles of dogs with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and correlated clinical features.||||Thirty-four client-owned dogs diagnosed with HCC (n = 26) and benign liver diseases (n = 8) and 11 age-matched healthy dogs.||||Prospective study using heparinized blood samples from fasted dogs. Plasma was deproteinized, and the concentrations of 21 amino acids were measured using an automated high-performance liquid chromatography amino acid analyzer.||||Plasma glutamic acid concentrations were significantly different among groups (P < .0024 after Bonferroni correction). Compared to healthy dogs, dogs with HCC and benign liver diseases had significantly higher concentrations of glutamic acid by post hoc analysis. However, no significant difference in the PFAA profiles of HCC and benign liver diseases were detected. In addition, preoperative and postoperative PFAA profiles of dogs with HCC were not significantly different.||||Increased glutamic acid concentrations might play a role in the development or be a consequence of liver tumor formation. However, PFAA profiles of HCC could not be differentiated from those of benign lesions. In addition, glutamic acid concentrations did not change after surgical resection. These results indicate that PFAA profiles may not be useful biomarkers for detecting HCC in dogs.

Rheinic acid is a major active ingredient derived from Rhubarb. Rhubarb could suppress inflammation, tumor, fibrosis oxidative damage. However, RA as the main active component and extract monomer of Rhubarb, the pharmacological activity and the underlying molecular mechanism on various diseases has not yet been revealed.||||To determine the potential role of rheinic acid (RA) in ameliorating inflammation of rats with acute radiation enteritis (ARE), and explore the underlying mechanism.||||ARE rat model was established by irradiated with single-dose 10 Gy X-rays at a rate of 0.62 Gy/min to the abdomen. The rats were executed after orally administered with Rheinic acid 7 days and used in the subsequent experiments. Body weight, fecal characteristics and bloody of rats were used to assess the disease activity index. Histological analysis of the jejunum and colon were evaluated using H&E staining. The pro-inflammatory cytokines levels were measured by immunohistochemistry and ELISA. The levels of nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) were also determined. The mRNA and protein expression were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot, respectively.||||Rheinic acid promoted intestinal functional recovery, and ameliorated intestinal damage and bloody stool in ARE rats. Rheinic acid strongly decreased the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, NO, and MDA, whereas increased levels of anti-oxidants, SOD and GSH. Moreover, the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), were decreased with RA treatment. Further study indicated that PPAR-γ was activated and thereby NF-κB and p38 MAPK signaling pathway were suppressed after rheinic acid treatment.||||Rheinic acid could ameliorate acute radiation enteritis and the underlying molecular mechanism is, at least partially, through PPAR-γ/NF-κB and p38 MAPK/JNK pathways.

Epigenetic heterogeneity in cancer.||||||||Phenotypic and functional heterogeneity is one of the hallmarks of human cancers. Tumor genotype variations among tumors within different patients are known as interpatient heterogeneity, and variability among multiple tumors of the same type arising in the same patient is referred to as intra-patient heterogeneity. Subpopulations of cancer cells with distinct phenotypic and molecular features within a tumor are called intratumor heterogeneity (ITH). Since Nowell proposed the clonal evolution of tumor cell populations in 1976, tumor heterogeneity, especially ITH, was actively studied. Research has focused on the genetic basis of cancer, particularly mutational activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs). The phenomenon of ITH is commonly explained by Darwinian-like clonal evolution of a single tumor. Despite the monoclonal origin of most cancers, new clones arise during tumor progression due to the continuous acquisition of mutations. It is clear that disruption of the "epigenetic machinery" plays an important role in cancer development. Aberrant epigenetic changes occur more frequently than gene mutations in human cancers. The epigenome is at the intersection of the environment and genome. Epigenetic dysregulation occurs in the earliest stage of cancer. The current trend of epigenetic therapy is to use epigenetic drugs to reverse and/or delay future resistance to cancer therapies. A majority of cancer therapies fail to achieve durable responses, which is often attributed to ITH. Epigenetic therapy may reverse drug resistance in heterogeneous cancer. Complete understanding of genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity may assist in designing combinations of targeted therapies based on molecular information extracted from individual tumors.

A simplified method for therapeutic drug monitoring of mitotane by gas chromatography-electron ionization-mass spectrometry.||||||||Mitotane is a key drug for the treatment of adrenal cortical carcinoma. Due to its narrow therapeutic window, 14 to 20 μg/mL, monitoring its concentration is crucially important. In this study, a simplified method for measuring mitotane in plasma using gas chromatography-electron ionization-mass spectrometry (GC-EI-MS) was developed. Through deproteination and liquid-liquid extraction, mitotane and an internal standard (IS) were extracted from plasma samples. GC-EI-MS yielded retention times of 8.2 and 8.7 min, for mitotane and the IS, respectively, with a total run time of 12 min. Selectivity and intra-/inter-batch accuracy and precision analyses provided a lower limit of quantification of 0.25 μg/mL, and a calibration curve between 0.25 and 40 μg/mL had good linearity (coefficient of determination = 0.992). The matrix effect factor and percent recovery of the method had good precision. Additionally, long-term sample stability was observed below 4°C. In a clinical setting, mitotane levels in plasma from an adrenal cortical carcinoma patient were within calibration range. Therefore, this simplified method can be applied to routine therapeutic drug monitoring of mitotane, which may contribute to improved treatment of adrenal cortical carcinoma.

[Lipoic acid: physiological role and prospects for clinical application].||||||||α-Lipoic acid (also known as thioctic acid) is a natural vitamin-like compound. Lipoic acid contains asymmetrical carbon, which causes the presence of two possible optical isomers (enantiomers): R-lipoic acid (levogyrate isomer) and S-lipoic acid (rightspinning isomer). Lipoic acid functions as a cofactor for several important mitochondrial multienzyme complexes, enhances the uptake of glucose by the cells, and modulates the activity of various signaling molecules and transcription factors. It was shown that α-lipoic acid and its derivative, dihydrolipoic acid, have a direct antioxidant effect due to the neutralization of reactive oxygen species that are destructive to DNA, proteins and lipids of cells. Dihydrolipoic acid enhances the antioxidant properties of ascorbic acid, glutathione and ubiquinone. Available evidence suggests that supplementation with lipoic acid reduces the symptoms of peripheral diabetic neuropathy. Results from randomized controlled trials show that high doses of lipoic acid can improve the glycemic profile of subjects with metabolic disorders. Lipoic acid can be used to control body weight in people with obesity. R-Lipoic acid is synthesized in the human body and is contained in foods in a form covalently associated with lysine (lipoyllysine). Its dose in dietary supplements significantly exceeds the amount in the diet. Most dietary supplements contain a racemic mixture of R- and S-lipoic acid.

Minocycline reverses diabetes-associated cognitive impairment in rats.||||||||Minocycline a tetracycline antibiotic is known for anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective actions. Here we determine the therapeutic potential of minocycline against type 2 diabetes associated cognitive decline in rats.||||High fat diet (HFD) and low dose streptozotocin (STZ; 25 mg/kg) were used to induce diabetes in Sprague-Dawley rats. Fasting blood glucose and haemoglobin (Hb) A1c were measured in these animals. Cognitive parameters were measured using passive avoidance and elevated plus maze test. Hippocampal Acetylcholine esterase (AchE), reduced glutathione (GSH), cytokines, chemokine levels were measured and histopathological evaluations were conducted. The diabetic animals were then given minocycline (50 mg/kg; 15 days) and the above parameters were reassessed. MTT and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays were conducted on neuronal cells in the presence of glucose with or without minocycline treatment.||||We induced diabetes using HFD and STZ in these animals. Animals showed high fasting blood glucose levels (>245 mg/dl) and HbA1c compared to control animals. Diabetes significantly lowered step down latency and increased transfer latency. Diabetic animals showed significantly higher AchE, Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, Interleukin (IL)-1β and Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and lower GSH levels and reduced both CA1 and CA3 neuronal density compared to controls. Minocycline treatment partially reversed the above neurobehavioral and biochemical changes and improved hippocampal neuronal density in diabetic animals. Cell line studies showed glucosemediated neuronal death, which was considerably reversed upon minocycline treatment.||||Minocycline, primarily by its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions prevented hippocampal neuronal loss thus partially reversing the diabetes-associated cognitive decline in rats.

Drug monitoring of tamoxifen metabolites predicts vaginal dryness and verifies a low discontinuation rate from the Norwegian Prescription Database.||||||||Tamoxifen is an important targeted endocrine therapy in breast cancer. However, side effects and early discontinuation of tamoxifen remains a barrier for obtaining the improved outcome benefits of long-term tamoxifen treatment. Biomarkers predictive of tamoxifen side effects remain unidentified. The objective of this prospective population-based study was to investigate the value of tamoxifen metabolite concentrations as biomarkers for side effects. A second objective was to assess the validity of discontinuation rates obtained through pharmacy records with the use of tamoxifen drug monitoring.||||Longitudinal serum samples, patient-reported outcome measures and pharmacy records from 220 breast cancer patients were obtained over a 6-year period. Serum concentrations of tamoxifen metabolites were measured by LC-MS/MS. Associations between metabolite concentrations and side effects were analyzed by logistic regression and cross table analyses. To determine the validity of pharmacy records we compared longitudinal tamoxifen concentrations to discontinuation rates obtained through the Norwegian Prescription database (NorPD). Multivariable Cox regression models were performed to identify predictors of discontinuation.||||At the 2nd year of follow-up, a significant association between vaginal dryness and high concentrations of tamoxifen, Z-4'-OHtam and tam-NoX was identified. NorPD showed a tamoxifen-discontinuation rate of 17.9% at 5 years and drug monitoring demonstrated similar rates. Nausea, vaginal dryness and chemotherapy-naive status were significant risk factors for tamoxifen discontinuation.||||This real-world data study suggests that measurements of tamoxifen metabolite concentrations may be predictive of vaginal dryness in breast cancer patients and verifies NorPD as a reliable source of adherence data.

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using DXA. Twenty-four inflammatory biomarkers were analyzed. Incident falls over 3 y were determined through telephone interviews every 4 mo. Multiple regression, linear mixed effects models, negative binomial regression, and mediation analysis were utilized in this study.||||A higher E-DII score (indicating a more proinflammatory diet) was associated with higher concentrations of IL-6 (β: 0.028 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.053), IL-7 (β: 0.020 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.037), and TNF-α (β: 0.027 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.051). A higher E-DII score was also associated with lower appendicular lean mass adjusted for BMI (ALMBMI) (β: -0.006 kg/m2; 95% CI: -0.010, -0.001). For every unit increase in E-DII (range: -4.91 to +3.66 units), incident falls rates increased by 13% (incidence rate ratio: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.21) over 3 y. Mediation analysis showed that the association between E-DII and 3-y incident falls was influenced by the concentrations of IL-7 by 24%. There was no association between E-DII and BMD.||||Consumption of a proinflammatory diet was associated with increased concentrations of IL-6, IL-7, and TNF-α; increased falls risk; and lower ALMBMI in community-dwelling older men. The association between incident falls and E-DII was partly mediated by concentrations of IL-7.

Cell-Specific DNA Methylation Signatures in Asthma.||||||||Asthma is a complex trait, often associated with atopy. The genetic contribution has been evidenced by familial occurrence. Genome-wide association studies allowed for associating numerous genes with asthma, as well as identifying new loci that have a minor contribution to its phenotype. Considering the role of environmental exposure on asthma development, an increasing amount of literature has been published on epigenetic modifications associated with this pathology and especially on DNA methylation, in an attempt to better understand its missing heritability. These studies have been conducted in different tissues, but mainly in blood or its peripheral mononuclear cells. However, there is growing evidence that epigenetic changes that occur in one cell type cannot be directly translated into another one. In this review, we compare alterations in DNA methylation from different cells of the immune system and of the respiratory tract. The cell types in which data are obtained influences the global status of alteration of DNA methylation in asthmatic individuals compared to control (an increased or a decreased DNA methylation). Given that several genes were cell-type-specific, there is a great need for comparative studies on DNA methylation from different cells, but from the same individuals in order to better understand the role of epigenetics in asthma pathophysiology.

Biomarkers for diagnosis of Wilson's disease.||||||||Wilson's disease, first described by Samuel Wilson in 1912, is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder resulting from mutations in the ATP7B gene. The disease develops as a consequence of copper accumulating in affected tissues. There is no gold standard for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, which is often delayed due to the non-specific clinical features and the need for a combination of clinical and laboratory tests for diagnosis. This delay may in turn affect clinical outcome and has implications for other family members in terms of diagnosis. The Leipzig criteria were established to help standardise diagnosis and management. However, it should be emphasised that these criteria date from 2003, and many of these have not been formally evaluated; this review examines the evidence behind biochemical testing for Wilson's disease.||||To determine the diagnostic accuracy of three biochemical tests at specified cut-off levels for Wilson's disease. The index tests covered by this Cochrane Review are caeruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper and hepatic copper content. These tests were evaluated in those with suspected Wilson's disease and appropriate controls (either healthy or those with chronic liver disease other than Wilson's). In the absence of a gold standard for diagnosing Wilson's disease, we have used the Leipzig criteria as a clinical reference standard. To investigate whether index tests should be performed in all individuals who have been recommended for testing for Wilson's disease, or whether these tests should be limited to subgroups of individuals.||||We identified studies by extensive searching of, e.g. the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, the Web of Science and clinical trial registries (29 May 2019). Date of the most recent search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Inborn Errors of Metabolism Register: 29 May 2019.||||We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of an index test using the Leipzig criteria as a clinical reference standard for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease.||||Two review authors independently reviewed and extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of each included study using the QUADAS-2 tool. We had planned to undertake meta-analyses of the sensitivity, specificity at relevant cut-offs for each of the biochemical tests for Wilson's, however, due to differences in the methods used for each biochemical index test, it was not possible to combine the results in meta-analyses and hence these are described narratively.||||Eight studies, involving 5699 participants (which included 1009 diagnosed with Wilson's disease) were eligible for inclusion in the review. Three studies involved children only, one adults only and the four remaining studies involved both children and adults. Two evaluated participants with hepatic signs and six with a combination of hepatic and neurological signs and symptoms of Wilson's disease, as well as pre-symptomatic individuals. The studies were of variable methodological quality; with high risk if bias for participant selection and the reference standard used being of greatest methodological concern. Key differences between studies include differences in assay methodology, different cut-off values for diagnostic thresholds, different age and ethnicity groups. Concerns around study design imply that diagnostic accuracy figures may not transfer to populations outside of the relevant study.||||caeruloplasmin Five studies evaluated various thresholds of caeruloplasmin (4281 participants, of which 541 had WD). For caeruloplasmin a cut-off of 0.2 g/L as in the Leipzig criteria achieved a sensitivity of 77.1% to 99%, with variable specificity of 55.9% to 82.8%. Using the cut-off of 0.1 g/L of the Leipzig criteria seemed to lower the sensitivity overall, 65% to 78.9%, while increasing the specificity to 96.6% to 100%.||||hepatic copper Four studies evaluated various thresholds of hepatic copper (1150 participants, of which 367 had WD). The hepatic copper cut-off of 4 μmol/g used in the Leipzig criteria achieved a sensitivity of 65.7% to 94.4%, with a variable specificity of 52.2% to 98.6%.||||24-hour urinary copper Three studies evaluated various thresholds of 24-hour urinary copper (268 participants, of which 101 had WD). For 24-hour urinary copper, a cut-off of 0.64 to 1.6 μmol/24 hours used in the Leipzig criteria achieved a variable sensitivity of 50.0% to 80.0%, with a specificity of 75.6% to 98.3%.||||The cut-offs used for caeruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper and hepatic copper for diagnosing Wilson's disease are method-dependent and require validation in the population in which such index tests are going to be used. Binary cut-offs and use of single-test strategies to rule Wilson's disease in or out is not supported by the evidence in this review. There is insufficient evidence to inform testing in specific subgroups, defined by age, ethnicity or clinical subgroups.

Biomarkers for PTLD diagnosis and therapies.||||||||Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) represents a spectrum of lymphoproliferative disorders and is a serious complication of pediatric transplantation. The majority of PTLD are associated with Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and the characteristic EBV+ B cell lymphomas are the leading post-transplant malignancy in children. EBV+ PTLD remains a formidable issue in pediatric transplantation and is thought to result from impaired immunity to EBV as a result of immunosuppression. However, the key viral and immune factors that determine whether EBV+ PTLD develops remain unknown. Recently, there has been much interest in developing biomarkers in order to improve and achieve more personalized approaches, in the clinical diagnosis, management, and treatment of EBV+ PTLD. Here, we review the status of immune-, viral-, and B cell lymphoma-derived candidates for biomarkers of EBV+ PTLD.

Biomarkers for type 2 diabetes.||||||||The prevalence and incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), representing >90% of all cases of diabetes, are increasing rapidly worldwide. Identification of individuals at high risk of developing diabetes is of great importance as early interventions might delay or even prevent full-blown disease. T2D is a complex disease caused by multiple genetic loci in interplay with lifestyle and environmental factors. Recently over 400 distinct association signals were published; these explain 18% of the risk of T2D.||||In this review there is a major focus on risk factors and genetic and non-genetic biomarkers for the risk of T2D identified especially in large prospective population-based studies, and studies testing causality of the biomarkers for T2D in Mendelian randomization studies. Another focus is on understanding genome-phenome interplay in the classification of individuals with T2D into subgroups.||||Several recent large population-based studies and their meta-analyses have identified multiple potential genetic and non-genetic biomarkers for the risk of T2D. Combination of genetic variants and physiologically characterized pathways improves the classification of individuals with T2D into subgroups, and is also paving the way to a precision medicine approach, in T2D.

Circular RNAs and human glioma.||||||||As a newly discovered type of RNA, circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widespread throughout the eukaryotic genome. The expression of circRNAs is regulated by both cis-elements and trans-factors, and the expression pattern of circRNAs is cell type- and disease-specific. Similar to other types of non-coding RNAs, functions of circRNAs are also versatile. CircRNAs have been reported previously to function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, protein sponges, coding RNAs or scaffolds for protein complexes. Recently, several circRNAs have been reported to play important roles in human malignancies, including glioma. Here, we reviewed several reports related to circRNAs and glioma, as well as the potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications of circRNAs in brain cancer. In general, some circRNAs, such as circSMARCA5 and circCFH, are found to be expressed in a glioma-specific pattern, these circRNAs may be used as tumor biomarkers. In addition, some circRNAs have been found to play oncogenic roles in glioma (e.g., circNFIX and circNT5E), whereas others have been reported to function as tumor suppressors (e.g., circFBXW7 and circSHPRH). Furthermore, circRNA is a good tool for protein expression because of its higher stability compared to linear RNAs. Thus, circRNAs may also be an ideal choice for gene/protein delivery in future brain cancer therapies. There are some challenges in circRNA research in glioma and other diseases. Research related to circRNAs in glioma is comparatively new and many mysteries remain to be solved.

Circular RNAs in leukemia.||||||||In pace with the development of gene sequencing technology and transcriptome research, it has been found that 70 to 90% of the human genome is transcribed into RNAs, while only 2% of RNAs encode proteins. This implies that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) may exert vital biological functions and a full analysis of non-coding transcriptomes is needed. Over the past decade, the advance in high-throughput sequencing and transcriptome profiling has enabled the identification of circular RNAs (circRNAs) involved in many biological processes and the occurrence and development of diseases. Accumulating evidence has revealed that circRNAs may serve as new biomarkers for diagnosis as well as provide promising therapeutic approaches and novel drug screening strategies for leukemia. A comprehensive understanding of circRNAs in leukemia is a prerequisite for the development of clinical translational research. In this review, we will discuss the general information of circRNAs and focus on the current advances in understanding the association between dysregulated circRNAs and leukemia.

DNA methylation in thyroid cancer.||||||||In recent years, cancer genomics has provided new insights into genetic alterations and signaling pathways involved in thyroid cancer. However, the picture of the molecular landscape is not yet complete. DNA methylation, the most widely studied epigenetic mechanism, is altered in thyroid cancer. Recent technological advances have allowed the identification of novel differentially methylated regions, methylation signatures and potential biomarkers. However, despite recent progress in cataloging methylation alterations in thyroid cancer, many questions remain unanswered. The aim of this review is to comprehensively examine the current knowledge on DNA methylation in thyroid cancer and discuss its potential clinical applications. After providing a general overview of DNA methylation and its dysregulation in cancer, we carefully describe aberrant methylation changes in thyroid cancer and relate them to methylation patterns, global hypomethylation and gene-specific alterations. We hope this review helps to accelerate the use of the diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potential of DNA methylation for the benefit of thyroid cancer patients.

Genetic risk scores in lipid disorders.||||||||Extensive work has gone into understanding the genetics of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and implicating genes involved in hyperlipidaemia. Translation into routine practise involves using genetic risk scores (GRS) to identify high-risk individuals in the general population. Some of these risk scores are beginning to disentangle the complex nature of CVD and inherited dyslipidaemias.||||GRS of varying complexity have been used to identify high-risk groups of patients with polygenic CVD including some individuals with risk equivalent to monogenic disease. In phenotypic familial hypercholesterolaemia a six or 12 gene lipid GRS may identify polygenic cases that comprise up to 50% of cases. In high triglyceride syndromes including even cases of familial chylomicronaemia syndrome more than 80% of cases are polygenic and not even associated with rare variants. In both familial hypercholesterolaemia and familial chylomicronaemia syndrome individuals with polygenic disease have a lower risk than those with monogenic disease.||||GRS show promise in identifying individuals with high risks of CVD. They have a close relationship with imaging markers. It is unclear whether GRS, imaging or both will be used to identify individuals at high risk of future events.

Long non-coding RNA in lung cancer.||||||||Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Owing to the difficulty in early diagnosis and the lack of effective treatment strategies, the 5-year survival rates for lung cancer remain very low. With the development of whole genome and transcriptome sequencing technology, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has attracted increasing attention. LncRNAs regulate gene expression at the epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels and are widely involved in a variety of diseases, including tumorigenesis. In lung cancer studies, multiple differentially expressed lncRNAs have been identified; several lncRNAs were identified as oncogenic lncRNAs with tumor-driving effects, while other lncRNAs play a role in tumor inhibition and are called tumor-suppressive lncRNAs. These tumor-suppressive lncRNAs are involved in multiple physiological processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis and thus participate in tumor progression. In this review, we discussed the oncogenic and tumor-suppressive lncRNAs in lung cancer, as well as their biological functions and regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, we found the potential significance of lncRNAs in clinical diagnosis and treatment.

Although early detection provides the opportunity of controlling the primary tumor with effective therapies, metastatic activity is fatal. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as important modifiers of a plethora of biological mechanisms including those involved in cancer.

It is believed that ncRNAs can provide new insights into novel regulatory mechanisms associated with clinical pathological characteristics, facilitating the development of therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of Rb. In this review, we describe a variety of ncRNAs, which capable of regulating the most likely candidate genes involved in the tumorigenesis of Rb, could prove useful in analyzing different aspects of this cancer.

RNA Packaging in HIV.||||||||Successful replication of the AIDS retrovirus, HIV, requires that its genomic RNA be packaged in assembling virus particles with high fidelity. However, cellular mRNAs can also be packaged under some conditions. Viral RNA (vRNA) contains a 'packaging signal' (ψ) and is packaged as a dimer, with two vRNA monomers joined by a limited number of base pairs. It has two conformers, only one of which is capable of dimerization and packaging. Recent years have seen important progress on the 3D structure of dimeric ψ. Gag, the protein that assembles into the virus particle, interacts specifically with ψ, but this is obscured under physiological conditions by its high nonspecific affinity for any RNA. New results suggest that vRNA is selected for packaging because ψ nucleates assembly more efficiently than other RNAs.

S100 proteins in atherosclerosis.||||||||Atherosclerosis is an arterial disease associated with dyslipidemia, abnormal arterial calcification and oxidative stress. It has been shown that a continued chronic inflammatory state of the arterial wall contributes to the development of atherosclerosis. The inflammatory stimulation, recruitment of inflammatory cells and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines enhances vascular inflammation. Some members of the S100 proteins family bind with their receptors, such as advanced glycation end products (RAGE), scavenger receptors (CD36) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), contributing to the cellular response in atherosclerotic progression. This review summarizes the roles of S100 proteins (S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12) in the vascular inflammation, vascular calcification and vascular oxidative stress. S100 proteins are released from monocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells in response to cellular stress stimuli, and then the binding of S100 proteins to RAGE activate downstream signaling such as transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB) translocation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which act as a positive feedback loop for inducing pro-inflammatory phenotype in a wide variety of cell types including endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and leukocytes. Thus, it suggests that the inhibition of S100 proteins-mediated RAGE and TLR4 activation appears to be a promising approach to treat atherosclerosis. In addition, recent study showed that serum S100A12 can predict future cardiovascular events, highlighting that S100A12 is likely to be a potential biomarker of therapeutic efficacy and disease progression in coronary heart disease. Future studies of patients with coronary heart disease may provide more evidences supporting that S100 proteins is promising drug target in the prevention and therapy of atherosclerosis.

Evaluation of the association of Wnt signaling with coronary artery calcification in patients on dialysis with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism.||||||||Patients with end-stage renal disease have a higher risk of death from cardiovascular events, which can be mainly attributed to coronary artery calcification (CAC). Wnt signaling is involved in vascular development and may play a role in vascular calcification. This study aimed to evaluate CAC prevalence in patients on dialysis with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) and identify CAC risk factors.||||The study is a retrospective analysis of the severe hyperparathyroidism registration study that prospectively recruited patients on dialysis with severe SHPT who were candidates for parathyroidectomy, from October 2013 to May 2015. CAC and bone mineral density (BMD) were measured. Demographic and clinical data including calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, intact parathyroid hormone, Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1), and sclerostin levels were analyzed. CAC scores were reported in Agatston units (AU).||||A total of 61 patients were included in this study. No CAC, mild CAC (<100 AU), moderate CAC (>100 AU), and severe CAC (>400 AU) were observed in 4.9%, 11.4%, 14.8%, and 68.9% of patients, respectively. DKK1 and sclerostin were not associated with CAC. In univariate analysis, CAC was significantly correlated with age, sex (male), total cholesterol, and intravenous pulse calcitriol (p<0.05). CAC was not inversely correlated with the BMD, T scores, or Z scores of the femoral neck (p>0.05). In multivariate analysis, the stepwise forward multiple linear regression revealed that CAC was associated with age, male sex and intravenous pulse calcitriol (p<0.05). Furthermore, serum sclerostin was positively correlated with the BMD of the femoral neck but negatively associated with intact parathyroid hormone (p<0.05). Serum sclerostin was significantly associated with severely low bone mass with Z-scores<-2.5 of the femoral neck, even when adjusted for serum intact parathyroid hormone, vitamin D status, dialysis pattern, sex, and DKK-1 (p<0.05).||||The patients on dialysis with severe SHPT have a high prevalence of vascular calcification. Although the Wnt signaling pathway could play a role in hyperparathyroid bone disease, CAC may be mainly due to the treatment modality rather than the Wnt signaling pathway associated bone metabolism in patients on dialysis with severe SHPT.

Data from 19 of these studies indicated significant statistical differences between cancerous patients and controls with regard to serum and plasma Zn concentration (SMD [(95 %CI): -1.61(-2.43, -0.79)]. There was a significant statistical difference between the breast tissue and hair as regards Zn status (SMD (95%CI): 2.32(1.42, 3.21)) and (SMD (95v%CI): -1.80(-3.41, -0.20), respectively. Zn concentration levels typically decreased in blood and hair samples of patients with breast cancer, whereas it was elevated in tumor tissues.||||There is a significant relationship between lowered serum Zn concentrations and risk of breast cancer onset or recurrences in women, but because of high heterogeneity, we recommend other primary studies.

A view on drug resistance in cancer.||||||||The problem of resistance to therapy in cancer is multifaceted. Here we take a reductionist approach to define and separate the key determinants of drug resistance, which include tumour burden and growth kinetics; tumour heterogeneity; physical barriers; the immune system and the microenvironment; undruggable cancer drivers; and the many consequences of applying therapeutic pressures. We propose four general solutions to drug resistance that are based on earlier detection of tumours permitting cancer interception; adaptive monitoring during therapy; the addition of novel drugs and improved pharmacological principles that result in deeper responses; and the identification of cancer cell dependencies by high-throughput synthetic lethality screens, integration of clinico-genomic data and computational modelling. These different approaches could eventually be synthesized for each tumour at any decision point and used to inform the choice of therapy.

Epstein-Barr Virus-Associated Smooth Muscle Tumour: A Case Series with a Significant Proportion of Tumours Showing Proclivity for Cutaneous Soft Tissues.||||||||Epstein-Barr virus-associated smooth muscle tumours (EBV-SMTs) are rare neoplasms of uncertain biological potential. They are seen in the setting of immune suppression from a variety of causes, including HIV infection and post-transplant immunosuppression. Most of the literature pertaining to these neoplasms comprises case reports and small case series, with a dearth of documented cases from South Africa.||||To expand on the literature of these rare neoplasms in the South African context, with an emphasis on a subset showing a predilection for the cutaneous soft tissues.||||Twenty-one EBV-SMTs from 19 consecutive patients were retrieved from the archives of the Division of Anatomical Pathology in the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, and the National Health Laboratory Service. Clinical and pathological characteristics of each case were recorded, including patient age, tumour site, H&E morphology, immunophenotypic features and the tumoural EBV status.||||The patients' ages ranged from 12 to 63 years, with a mean of 36 years. Thirteen (68%) of the patients in whom the HIV status was known were HIV-positive. Two of the 19 patients each had 2 tumours, thus accounting for the total of 21 neoplasms studied. Although 12 of the 21 tumours (57.1%) were from a variety of visceral organs, 9 (42.9%) originated in the dermis and superficial subcutaneous tissues, making the cutaneous soft tissues the most commonly affected site. Morphologically, all of the neoplasms were characterised by fascicles of myoid cells, admixed rounder tumour cells, scattered intratumoural lymphocytes and variable immunohistochemical staining with markers of smooth muscle differentiation. All 21 neoplasms were proven to harbour EBV DNA.||||A significant proportion of EBV-SMTs may present in the cutaneous soft tissues. This neoplasm should, therefore, be included in the histopathological differential diagnosis of any cutaneous or superficial subcutaneous spindle cell tumour, especially in patients with a history of underlying immune suppression. Accurate diagnosis thereof and its distinction from other spindle cell neoplasms is important in view of management implications and the potential for multicentricity in some patients.

Adult dietary fat intake and ovarian cancer risk.||||||||The association of dietary fat intake with ovarian cancer risk has been inconsistent across populations. We examined dietary fat intake, overall and by type and ovarian cancer risk in two prospective cohort studies. We assessed long-term dietary fat intake among Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and NHSII participants using food frequency questionnaires administered every 2-4 years beginning in 1984 and 1991, respectively. We examined cumulative energy-adjusted intake of total fat, specific types of fat (animal, vegetable, saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and trans fat) and cholesterol. We identified 700 ovarian cancer cases in NHS and 196 in NHSII with dietary information. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate associations between intake and ovarian cancer risk. Dietary fat intake changed over time in both cohorts and was lower in NHS than NHSII. Higher cumulative average intakes of animal fat and cholesterol were significantly positively associated with risk of ovarian cancer in NHS (relative risk [RR] comparing extreme quartiles = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.20, 2.06 and 1.35, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.69, respectively), but not in NHSII. Other dietary fat sources were not clearly associated with risk in either population. We did not observe clear associations between dietary fat and ovarian cancer risk in two large prospective cohort studies.

Autoimmune diseases: Role of steroid hormones.||||||||Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders in terms of clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, and prevalence, and there is no agreement to date on a common classification. Adaptive immune responses are responsible for the existence of AIDs, although innate immunity is also involved in misguiding the immune response against self-antigens. Hormones, in general, and in particular steroid hormones, play a critical role in the physiology and pathology of the immune system, especially in adaptive immunity. Hormonal factors, alone or in relation to age, sex, and reproductive status, are involved in conditioning the onset of a number of AIDs. There is a well-defined sexual dimorphism for human AIDs. At the same time, the classic view has been that steroid hormones have well-defined effects, with one type, estrogens, being "pro-inflammatory" and the other two progestogens (progesterone and its synthetic analogs) and androgens being "anti-inflammatory." Although this view has been considered too simplistic and seems contradicted by numerous observations, it remains valid: progestogens and androgens are immunosuppressive and therefore protective against AIDs, whereas estrogens are immune-stimulatory and therefore pathogenic in AIDs.

Bioactive lipids in cancer stem cells.||||||||Tumours are known to be a heterogeneous group of cells, which is why they are difficult to eradicate. One possible cause for this is the existence of slow-cycling cancer stem cells (CSCs) endowed with stem cell-like properties of self-renewal, which are responsible for resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In recent years, the role of lipid metabolism has garnered increasing attention in cancer. Specifically, the key roles of enzymes such as stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase in CSCs, have gained particular interest. However, despite accumulating evidence on the role of proteins in controlling lipid metabolism, very little is known about the specific role played by lipid products in CSCs. This review highlights recent findings on the role of lipid metabolism in CSCs, focusing on the specific mechanism by which bioactive lipids regulate the fate of CSCs and their involvement in signal transduction pathways.

Homocysteine and psoriasis.||||||||Psoriasis is caused by a complex interplay among the immune system, genetic background, autoantigens, and environmental factors. Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with psoriasis have a significantly higher serum homocysteine (Hcy) level and a higher prevalence of hyperhomocysteinaemia (HHcy). Insufficiency of folic acid and vitamin B12 can be a cause of HHcy in psoriasis. Hcy may promote the immuno-inflammatory process in the pathogenesis of psoriasis by activating Th1 and Th17 cells and neutrophils, while suppressing regulatory T cells. Moreover, Hcy can drive the immuno-inflammatory process by enhancing the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in related to psoriasis. Hcy can induce nuclear factor kappa B activation, which is critical in the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis. There may be a link between the oxidative stress state in psoriasis and the effect of HHcy. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) may play a protective role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and the deficiency of H2S in psoriasis may be caused by HHcy. As the role of Hcy in the pathogenesis of psoriasis is most likely established, Hcy can be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of psoriasis. Systemic folinate calcium, a folic acid derivative, and topical vitamin B12 have found to be effective in treating psoriasis.

Relationships of Habitual Alcohol Intake with Erythrocyte-Related Indices in Middle-Aged Japanese Men.||||||||Anemia is induced by chronic alcohol abuse. However, it remains to be clarified whether a habitual alcohol intake affects erythrocyte-related indices in a general population.||||The subjects were 16,014 Japanese male workers aged 30-65 years. The subjects were divided into non-, occasional, and regular drinkers based on the frequency of alcohol consumption. Regular drinkers were further quantitatively divided based on their daily alcohol consumption into light, moderate, and heavy drinkers. Relationships between alcohol drinking and erythrocyte-related indices were investigated.||||Erythrocyte counts and hemoglobin levels tended to be lower and higher, respectively, with increases in the frequency and amount of drinking. In logistic regression analysis, the odds ratios (OR) for abnormally low erythrocyte counts of moderate and heavy drinkers vs. nondrinkers were significantly higher than the reference level of 1.00 and the values tended to be higher with an increase in the alcohol intake. The OR vs. nondrinkers for abnormally low levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit were significantly lower than the reference level in all of the drinker groups and they were lowest in light drinkers among the drinker groups.||||A habitual alcohol intake has different associations with erythrocyte counts and hemoglobin and with low erythrocyte counts and low hemoglobin. Thus, alcohol is thought to have diverse effects on erythropoiesis.

Cadmium exposure is a risk factor for NPC. We aimed to investigate the effect of cadmium exposure, by measuring cadmium level, and clinicopathologic factors on NPC disease progression and prognosis. A total of 134 NPC cases were analyzed and venous blood samples were collected. Blood cadmium level was analyzed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Clinical data were collected at baseline for patients and tumor characteristics from medical records. Progression-free survival (PFS) was analyzed during follow-up. The effect of cadmium exposure and clinical factors on PFS was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression models. Blood cadmium level was associated with history of disease and smoking history and pack-years. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, a high blood cadmium level, male sex, smoking history and increasing pack-years, as well as advanced clinical stage were all associated with short PFS. On multivariate analysis, blood cadmium level was an independent risk factor and predictor of NPC prognosis and disease progression. Cadmium exposure and related clinical factors can affect the prognosis of NPC, which merits further study to clarify.

Deep undepleted human serum proteome profiling toward biomarker discovery for Alzheimer's disease.||||||||Blood-based protein measurement is a routine practice for detecting biomarkers in human disease. Comprehensive profiling of blood/plasma/serum proteome is a challenge due to an extremely large dynamic range, as exemplified by a small subset of highly abundant proteins. Antibody-based depletion of these abundant proteins alleviates the problem but introduces experimental variations. We aimed to establish a method for direct profiling of undepleted human serum and apply the method toward biomarker discovery for Alzheimer's disease (AD), as AD is the most common form of dementia without available blood-based biomarkers in clinic.|||| = 5) sera were analyzed in this pilot study. In addition, we implemented a multiplexed targeted LC-MS3 method (TOMAHAQ) for the validation of selected target proteins.||||The TMT-LC/LC-MS/MS platform is capable of analyzing 4826 protein components (4368 genes), covering at least 6 orders of magnitude in dynamic range, representing one of the deepest serum proteome analysis. We defined intra- and inter- group variability in the AD and control groups. Statistical analysis revealed differentially expressed proteins in AD (26 decreased and 4 increased). Notably, these altered proteins are enriched in the known pathways of mitochondria, fatty acid beta oxidation, and AGE/RAGE. Finally, we set up a TOMAHAQ method to confirm the decrease of PCK2 and AK2 in our AD samples.||||Our results show an ultra-deep serum discovery study by TMT-LC/LC-MS/MS, and a validation experiment by TOMAHAQ targeted LC-MS3. The MS-based discovery and validation methods are of general use for biomarker discovery from complex biofluids (e.g. serum proteome). This pilot study also identified deregulated proteins, in particular proteins associated with mitochondrial function in the AD serum samples. These proteins may serve as novel AD candidate biomarkers.

New tools for Wilson's disease diagnosis: exchangeable copper fraction.||||||||Wilson's disease (WD) biochemical markers continue to evolve. Classical tests [serum copper, serum ceruloplasmin (Cp), urinary copper] have their own limits, and they are often insufficient to diagnose or exclude WD. So, calculated estimation of copper that is not bound to Cp has been proposed, but it is flawed. Therefore, we focused our research on a direct measurement of serum copper labile fraction. Exchangeable copper (CuEXC) offers a correct view of the free copper overload. It provides information on the spread and severity of WD. Relative exchangeable copper (REC) (percentage of exchangeable to total serum copper) that appreciates the toxic fraction of copper in blood is an excellent biomarker for WD diagnosis. These two tests are reliable and non-invasive. They give rapid answers for an appropriate diagnosis and make possible to start the treatment quickly without waiting for the result of the genetic tests. As early diagnosis and treatment are the keystones of successful management of patients with WD, different teams have already applied these tests in a routine framework to a large number of patients.

Predictive biomarkers for drug response in bladder cancer.||||||||Bladder cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Interpatient heterogeneity in response to a drug limits treatment options and impairs improvement of patient survival. For example, approximately half of patients do not respond to cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy, although it is the standard of care for muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer. The development of robust predictive biomarkers is expected to improve outcomes by enabling clinicians to use chemotherapy only in the patients who will benefit from it. Recent advances in the molecular characterization of bladder cancer showed that the basal subtype of bladder cancer and tumors with inactivating mutations in DNA damage repair genes were associated with greater benefit from cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The present review summarizes current efforts to develop predictive biomarkers for drug response in bladder cancer, focusing on those that predict the response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy for advanced bladder cancer. We also review the current situation with regard to the identification of predictive biomarkers for response to intravesical therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors and molecularly-targeted drugs. We also discuss the future applications of new technologies, including liquid biopsies and patient-derived organoids that will also serve as resources for the identification of biomarkers in bladder cancer.

A chromatin-based signalling mechanism directs the switch from mutagenic to error-free repair of DNA double strand breaks.||||||||Mutations caused by DNA damage are a main driver of cancer. We discovered that recognition of newly synthesised histone H4 directs breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) to post-replicative chromatin. The switch from mutagenic to error-free DNA double strand break repair by homologous recombination is therefore controlled by chromatin.

Association of serum total fatty acids with type 2 diabetes.||||||||Type 2 diabetes (T2D), a typical metabolic disease, is closely associated with serum free fatty acids. But the association between serum total fatty acids (TFAs, free fatty acids plus esterified fatty acids) and T2D has not been reported.||||Serum esterified fatty acids were hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions, and serum TFAs were extracted after acidizing. Fourteen of serum TFAs in 1,828 serum samples, including 543 controls, 655 prediabetes, and 630 T2D patients, were simultaneously quantified based on the calibration curves of 8 fatty acids using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (MALDI-FTICR MS).||||Correlation analysis revealed strong correlations among serum TFAs and ratios of the TFAs in T2D patients compared with controls or prediabetes both in males and females. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that a panel including fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin type A1c, gamma-glutamyltransferase, triglyceride, C18:1, and C20:3, has a good capability to distinguish prediabetes from T2D, with the sensitivity of 87.0%, the specificity of 91.0%, and the area under curve (AUC) of 0.96.||||In this study, rapid, absolute, and simultaneous quantification of serum TFAs was performed using MALDI-FTICR MS. C18:1 and C20:3 were significantly correlated with prediabetes and T2D.

A high serum-free fatty acid level is associated with cancer.||||||||The objectives of this work were to investigate whether the serum-free fatty acid (FFA) level is meaningful in cancer patients and its role in cancer diagnosis.||||A total of 2206 patients were divided into a cancer group (n = 1019) and a noncancer group (n = 1187). Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and serum FFA and serum albumin levels were collected. Cancer patients were divided into subgroups according to the location of the cancer. We then compared serum FFA levels among the tumor subgroups. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to further evaluate the diagnostic ability of the FFA level. SPSS 22.0 software was used to analyze the results.||||The FFA level was higher in the cancer group than in the noncancer group. According to the multivariate analysis, there was also an increased risk of cancer associated with a high FFA level after adjusting for old age, female sex, and a low BMI. In the subgroup analysis, the FFA level in patients with lung cancer, gastric cancer, thyroid cancer, rectal cancer, colon cancer, and ovarian cancer was significantly higher than that in noncancer patients. The area under the effect-time curve (AUC) of FFAs in the whole cancer group was 0.58, while the thyroid cancer, rectal cancer, and ovarian cancer subgroups had AUCs > 0.6.||||Our study provides clinical evidence to support that fatty acid metabolism is associated with cancers and demonstrates that a high FFA level in the serum may be an indicator of cancer.

Metal ions and the extracellular matrix in tumor migration.||||||||In this review, we explore the roles of divalent metal ions in structure and function within the extracellular matrix (ECM), specifically, their interaction with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) during tumor progression. Metals and GAGs have been individually associated with physiological and pathological processes, however, their combined activities in regulating cell behavior and ECM remodeling have not been fully explored to date. During tumor progression, divalent metals and GAGs participate in central processes, such as cell migration and angiogenesis, either by modulating cell surface molecules, as well as soluble signaling factors. In addition, studies on metals and polysaccharides interactions have been of great value, as they provide structural information that can be correlated with function. Finally, we believe that understanding how metals are regulated in physiological and pathological conditions is paramount for the development of new treatment strategies, as well as diagnostic and exploratory tools.

The relationship between serum FGF-23 concentration and insulin resistance, prediabetes and dyslipidemia in obese children and adolescents.||||||||Background Obesity is known to cause metabolic disturbances including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and alters bone mineralization. The effects of obesity on fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), which is important in bone mineralization, have not yet been clarified. Our aim was to investigate the association between FGF-23 concentration and obesity-associated dysmetabolism. Methods Subjects comprised 46 obese children and adolescents. The same number of age-matched, healthy controls were recruited. Markers of bone mineralization and glucose metabolism were measured. Thyroid function and insulin resistance were investigated in both groups. In obese subjects; an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and hemoglobin A1c and lipid fractions were measured. Bone mineral density and hepatic steatosis were investigated. Results Serum FGF-23, α-klotho and 1,25(OH)2D3 concentrations were significantly lower while fasting insulin, fasting glucose, C-peptide and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) concentrations and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were significantly higher in the obese group compared to controls. A significant negative correlation was observed between free tri-iodothyronine (fT3) and both FGF-23 and α-klotho in the obese group. Significant negative correlation was found between FGF-23 and C-peptide and a positive correlation was found between FGF-23 and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c) in the obese subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Significant negative correlations were found between FGF-23 and both fasting insulin levels and C-peptide levels in the obese subjects with hepatic steatosis. Conclusions In our study, insulin resistance-associated hyperinsulinism and/or lower 1,25(OH)2D3 levels, both present in obese children and adolescents, may lead to decreased serum FGF-23 concentrations in obese subjects.

The role of oxidative stress and hypoxia in renal disease.||||||||Oxygen is required to sustain aerobic organisms. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are constantly released during mitochondrial oxygen consumption for energy production. Any imbalance between ROS production and its scavenger system induces oxidative stress. Oxidative stress, a critical contributor to tissue damage, is well-known to be associated with various diseases. The kidney is susceptible to hypoxia, and renal hypoxia is a common final pathway to end stage kidney disease, regardless of the underlying cause. Renal hypoxia aggravates oxidative stress, and elevated oxidative stress, in turn, exacerbates renal hypoxia. Oxidative stress is also enhanced in chronic kidney disease, especially diabetic kidney disease, through various mechanisms. Thus, the vicious cycle between oxidative stress and renal hypoxia critically contributes to the progression of renal injury. This review examines recent evidence connecting chronic hypoxia and oxidative stress in renal disease and subsequently describes several promising therapeutic approaches against oxidative stress.

Somatostatin receptor expression in parathyroid neoplasms.||||||||Parathyroid carcinoma represents a rare cause of primary hyperparathyroidism. Distinguishing carcinoma from the benign tumors underlying primary hyperparathyroidism remains challenging. The diagnostic criteria for parathyroid carcinoma are local and/or metastatic spreading. Atypical parathyroid adenomas share other histological features with carcinomas but lack invasive growth. Somatostatin receptors are commonly expressed in different neuroendocrine tumors, but whether this also holds for parathyroid tumors remains unknown. Our aim is to examine the immunohistochemical expression of somatostatin receptor 1-5 in parathyroid typical adenomas, atypical adenomas, and carcinomas.||||We used a tissue microarray construct from a nationwide cohort of parathyroid carcinomas (n = 32), age- and gender-matched typical parathyroid adenomas (n = 72), and atypical parathyroid adenomas (n = 27) for immunohistochemistry of somatostatin receptor subtypes 1-5. We separately assessed cytoplasmic, membrane, and nuclear expression and also investigated the associations with histological, biochemical, and clinical characteristics.||||All parathyroid tumor subgroups expressed somatostatin receptors, although membrane expression appeared negligible. Except for somatostatin receptor 1, expression patterns differed between the three tumor types. Adenomas exhibited the weakest and carcinomas the strongest expression of somatostatin receptor 2, 3, 4 and 5. We observed the largest difference for cytoplasmic somatostatin receptor 5 expression.||||Parathyroid adenomas, atypical adenomas, and carcinomas all express somatostatin receptor subtypes 1-5. Somatostatin receptor 5 may serve as a potential tumor marker for malignancy. Studies exploring the role of somatostatin receptor imaging and receptor-specific therapies in patients with parathyroid carcinomas are needed.

Green tea polyphenols(GTP) have been reported to be neuroprotective. The present study was performed to examine the therapeutic potential of GTP on isoflurane-induced cognitive deficits. Six-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were treated with 1.6% isoflurane for 6 hours. Multiple-dose of GTP at 25 mg/kg for 7 consecutive days and single-dose at 75 mg/kg on the 7th day were respectively administered intraperitoneally to model mice before anesthesia. Fear conditioning test and novel objection recognition were conducted to assess cognition of mice. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) was evaluated using assay kits. Protein expression levels of right hippocampus p-CaMKII, p-CREB and BDNF were examined by Western blot. Our results indicated that 6 h isoflurane anesthesia induced cognitive impairment in early 3 days. Meanwhile, the hippocampus SOD declined in step. The expression levels of p-CaMKII, p-CREB and BDNF were also downregulated. GTP 25mg/kg per day significantly attenuated cognitive dysfunction on Day 3 following isoflurane anesthesia. Moreover, GTP 25mg/kg per day effectively mitigated isodlurane-induced declines of SOD, as well as the p-CaMKII, p-CREB and BDNF levels. However, single-dose at 75 mg/kg of GTP had no significant effects. This study indicated that GTP attenuate isoflurane-induced cognition impairment and this positive effects may be related to its antioxidant properties.

Sugar alcohol provides imaging contrast in cancer detection.||||||||Clinical imaging is widely used to detect, characterize and stage cancers in addition to monitoring the therapeutic progress. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) aided by contrast agents utilizes the differential relaxivity property of water to distinguish between tumorous and normal tissue. Here, we describe an MRI contrast method for the detection of cancer using a sugar alcohol, maltitol, a common low caloric sugar substitute that exploits the chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) property of the labile hydroxyl group protons on maltitol (malCEST). In vitro studies pointed toward concentration and pH-dependent CEST effect peaking at 1 ppm downfield to the water resonance. Studies with control rats showed that intravenously injected maltitol does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier (BBB). In glioma carrying rats, administration of maltitol resulted in the elevation of CEST contrast in the tumor region only owing to permeable BBB. These preliminary results show that this method may lead to the development of maltitol and other sugar alcohol derivatives as MRI contrast agents for a variety of preclinical imaging applications.

In this study, the effect of sapylin on lung cancer cell A549 was investigated. A549 cell lines were treated with sapylin (0.1, 0.5, and 1 KE/mL) for different time intervals. A549 cell proliferation and apoptosis was determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide/Ki67 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Western blot was used to determine the expressions of proteins involved in proliferation, apoptosis, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/serine/threonine kinase (PI3K/AKT), Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling pathway. Level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was insured by using the ROS kit. Sapylin inhibited A549 cell viability and the expressions of proliferation-related proteins (cyclin E1 and D1) in dose- and time-dependent manners. Sapylin promoted apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manners. Sapylin also promoted the expressions of apoptotic proteins (cleaved caspase-3 and 8) in dose- and time-dependent manners. Furthermore, sapylin increased the intracellular concentration of ROS in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, the high expression of ROS level might induce inhibition of cell viability and increase cell apoptosis. The mechanistic study revealed that sapylin inactivated the PI3K/AKT and Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that sapylin inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis in lung cancer cells, thus providing a new theoretical basis for the treatment of lung cancer.

Columbamine suppresses the proliferation and malignization of colon cancer cells via abolishing Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.||||||||Colon cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Because of the side effects and defects in tolerance of chemotherapy, it is necessary to discover new drugs for colon cancer treatment. Columbamine has been identified as an effective anti-osteosarcoma compound with only minor side effects. In this study, we analyzed the anticancer effect of columbamine on colon cancer.||||Human colon cancer cell lines were treatment with columbamine. MTT assay, colony formation assay, apoptosis detection and tumorigenicity assay were performed to detect the protective effect of columbamine on colon cancer development. Western blot assay and luciferase reporter assay were conducted to investigate the potential mechanism of the columbamine treatment.||||Columbamine significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion process of colon cancer cells, and dramatically promoted the apoptosis rate of colon cancer cells to further suppress the development of colon cancer to tumor. Both the signaling transducing and key factors expression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway were obviously repressed by columbamine treatment in a dose-dependent manner.||||The present study indicated that columbamine exerts its anti-tumor effect in colon cancer cells through abolishing Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

The control could be placebo, no treatment or any other treatment. We included prospective, retrospective, randomized and non-randomized studies. We searched Medline and Embase via Ovid, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and screened reference lists of included articles. Where possible, we applied random-effects meta-analyses.||||The 23 included studies reported on 2055 patients and mostly compared D-penicillamine to no treatment, zinc, trientine or succimer. One study compared tetrathiomolybdate and trientine. Post-decoppering maintenance therapy was addressed in one study only. Eleven of 23 studies were of low quality. When compared to no treatment, D-penicillamine was associated with a lower mortality (odds ratio 0.013; 95% CI 0.0010 to 0.17). When compared to zinc, there was no association with mortality (odds ratio 0.73; 95% CI 0.16 to 3.40) and prevention or amelioration of clinical symptoms (odds ratio 0.84; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.48). Conversely, D-penicillamine may have a greater impact on side effects and treatment discontinuations than zinc.||||There are some indications that zinc is safer than D-penicillamine therapy while being similarly effective in preventing or reducing hepatic or neurological WD symptoms.

Because of the side effects and defects in tolerance of chemotherapy, it is necessary to discover new drugs for colon cancer treatment. Columbamine has been identified as an effective anti-osteosarcoma compound with only minor side effects. In this study, we analyzed the anticancer effect of columbamine on colon cancer.||||Human colon cancer cell lines were treatment with columbamine. MTT assay, colony formation assay, apoptosis detection and tumorigenicity assay were performed to detect the protective effect of columbamine on colon cancer development. Western blot assay and luciferase reporter assay were conducted to investigate the potential mechanism of the columbamine treatment.||||Columbamine significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion process of colon cancer cells, and dramatically promoted the apoptosis rate of colon cancer cells to further suppress the development of colon cancer to tumor. Both the signaling transducing and key factors expression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway were obviously repressed by columbamine treatment in a dose-dependent manner.||||The present study indicated that columbamine exerts its anti-tumor effect in colon cancer cells through abolishing Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Columbamine may be a new therapy compound for colon cancer.

Nonesterified fatty acids, cognitive decline, and dementia.||||||||Dementia is rapidly growing as sources of morbidity and mortality as the US population ages, but its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. As a result, no disease-modifying treatments currently exist. We review the evidence that nonesterified fatty acids may play a key role in this condition.||||Nonesterified fatty acids appear to influence several pathways leading to dementia. In addition to their vascular effects, these moieties cross the blood-brain barrier, where they are toxic to several cell types. They may also influence insulin metabolism in the brain directly and indirectly, and some drugs that lower circulating levels appear to slow cognitive decline and brain atrophy in diabetes.||||Nonesterified fatty acids may contribute to dementia, much as they do to diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Several therapeutic agents lower circulating levels of nonesterified fatty acids and should be tested for their potential preventive effects on cognitive decline in healthy populations before irreversible neuronal attrition occurs.

The log-rank test also showed a shorter disease-free survival (DFS) in pN+ patients (p = 0.0008). mTOR expression was significantly higher in patients whose disease recurred (p = 0.009). The DFS rate was also significantly shorter in cases of LSCC with an mTOR expression ≥11.55% (p = 0.049). Multivariate analysis showed that N status (p = 0.002) and mTOR expression (p = 0.037) retained their prognostic significance in relation to cancer recurrence. In a subgroup of LSCCs with a non-nuclear maspin pattern, mTOR expression was significantly higher in patients whose disease recurred. Multivariate analysis disclosed that N stage (p = 0.012) retained its independent prognostic significance for disease recurrence in this setting. mTOR expression showed a trend towards independent significance in terms of carcinoma recurrence (p = 0.083).||||mTOR inhibitors seem promising for use in cancer therapies. Further investigations are needed on the prospects of incorporating modern mTOR inhibitors in multimodality or multitarget strategies against advanced LSCCs, also considering the role and expression of tumor suppressor genes.

Impulsivity moderates the effect of social anxiety on in-lab alcohol craving.||||||||Social anxiety (SA) is thought to relate to alcohol misuse. However, current evidence is inconsistent - especially in young adulthood. Recent non-experimental data show that trait impulsivity moderates the effect of SA on alcohol misuse. Specifically, this work suggests that concurrently elevated impulsivity may draw attention to the immediate, anxiolytic effects of drinking - thus promoting alcohol misuse among those high in SA. Otherwise, without elevated impulsivity, a socially anxious person may not drink due to focusing on alcohol's possible negative outcomes (e.g., embarrassing behaviours). The next step in this research is to examine if impulsivity impacts in-the-moment subjective craving among socially anxious individuals. This was the goal of the present experiment. After baseline measures, undergraduate participants (N = 110) completed the Trier Social Stress Test followed by an alcohol (versus neutral) cue exposure. Subjective craving ratings were collected at both baseline and post-cue exposure. Moderation analyses revealed that socially anxious individuals endorsed strong cravings following an alcohol (but not a neutral) cue exposure, but only if they also had elevated impulsivity. In-lab craving was positively correlated with retrospective reports of alcohol misuse. Our findings demonstrate that impulsivity contributes to SA-related risk for alcohol misuse.

Clinical relevance of cholesterol homeostasis genes in colorectal cancer.||||||||Accumulation of cholesterol is a well-known feature in cancer. Preclinical studies suggest the contribution of various cholesterol regulators in CRC. However, their clinical relevance remains poorly understood. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the expression of these modulators in CRC and elucidate their diagnostic and prognostic value. mRNA levels of HMGCR, SREBF2, NR1H3 and NR1H2 were downregulated in tumors in local and TCGA cohort. The expression of LDLR, ABCA1 and SCARB1 was not consistent in the two cohorts. Western Blot analysis showed the increased levels of LDLR and reduced levels of LXR in early stage patients. Tumoral SREBP2 levels were enhanced in early stage whereas decreased in late stage. The individual expression of HMGCR, SREBF2, NR1H3 and NR1H2 did not have the potential to be used as independent prognostic marker, however, the combined expression of these genes associated with poor clinical outcome independent of lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and advanced stage. This work sheds light on deregulation of cholesterol uptake and efflux pathways and provides novel leads in the development of biomarkers and therapeutic regimens that can detect and target CRC at initial stages.

Effects of diosgenin and its derivatives on atherosclerosis.||||||||Atherosclerosis is one of the leading causes of death in patients with cardiovascular diseases worldwide. Although some progress has been made in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases still continue to rise. At present, it is an important topic for researchers to develop safe and effective drugs from natural products to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases. Diosgenin (DSG) is a plant sterol saponin mainly found in natural medicinal plants such as fenugreek seeds and wild yam tubers. More and more studies have reported that DSG has significant pharmacological activities such as anticancer, cardiovascular protection, hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotection. Furthermore, diosgenin is also an important basic raw material for the preparation of steroids and contraceptives in the pharmaceutical industry. Numerous preclinical studies have shown that DSG has great potential in the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases in vivo and in vitro, especially in atherosclerosis. This review mainly discusses the effects of DSG on endothelial dysfunction, lipid profile, and macrophage foam cell formation, VSMC viability, thrombosis and inflammation during the formation of atherosclerosis. Also, the mechanism of DSG on atherosclerosis was elaborated in detail. It is noteworthy that newly synthesized DSG derivatives and DSG delivery systems have good antithrombotic activity and pharmacokinetic characteristics.

Dystonia and dopamine: From phenomenology to pathophysiology.||||||||A line of evidence suggests that the pathophysiology of dystonia involves the striatum, whose activity is modulated among other neurotransmitters, by the dopaminergic system. However, the link between dystonia and dopamine appears complex and remains unclear. Here, we propose a physiological approach to investigate the clinical and experimental data supporting a role of the dopaminergic system in the pathophysiology of dystonic syndromes. Because dystonia is a disorder of motor routines, we first focus on the role of dopamine and striatum in procedural learning. Second, we consider the phenomenology of dystonia from every angle in order to search for features giving food for thought regarding the pathophysiology of the disorder. Then, for each dystonic phenotype, we review, when available, the experimental and imaging data supporting a connection with the dopaminergic system. Finally, we propose a putative model in which the different phenotypes could be explained by changes in the balance between the direct and indirect striato-pallidal pathways, a process critically controlled by the level of dopamine within the striatum. Search strategy and selection criteria References for this article were identified through searches in PubMed with the search terms « dystonia », « dopamine", « striatum », « basal ganglia », « imaging data », « animal model », « procedural learning », « pathophysiology », and « plasticity » from 1998 until 2018.

Renal oncocytoma with vascular and perinephric fat invasion.||||||||Renal oncocytoma is a benign epithelial neoplasm typically composed of large cells with granular eosinophilic cytoplasm. Although rare, histologically worrisome features such as vascular and perinephric fat invasion have been reported. Of the 159 renal oncocytomas resected at our institution, 20 (12.6%) had vascular and/or perinephric fat invasion. Microscopically, 10 oncocytomas had perinephric fat invasion, 7 had vascular invasion and 3 had both vascular and perinephric fat invasion. Grossly, perinephric fat invasion was visible in three cases and tumour was identified within the branches of the renal vein in two cases. Tumours occurred in 14 men and 6 women (M:F = 2.3:1). The mean age at diagnosis was 64.5 years (range, 33-88 years). A total of 11 cases had radical nephrectomies while 9 cases had partial nephrectomies. There was no evidence of disease recurrence, metastasis or death due to tumour after a mean follow up of 25.6 months (range, 2-103 months). The presence of vascular and perinephric fat invasion in renal oncocytoma though worrisome, does not alter the benign course of the tumour.

Here, we investigated the effect of H diet subjected to the genitors on different cardio-metabolic parameters on first (F1) and second (F2) generation offspring.

Part of F1 offspring, becoming G1 genitors for generating of the F2 offspring. After weaning, F1 and F2 rats only consumed C diet. Nutritional, biometric, biochemical and hemodynamic parameters were evaluated. G0HF genitors had a reduction in food intake, but energy intake was similar to the control group. F1H and F2H offspring presented increased plasma leptin, insulin and fasting glucose levels, dietary intake, energy intake, adiposity index, mean arterial pressure (MAP), sympathetic drive evidenced by the hexamethonium and insulin resistance (IR) compared to control. Our data showed that maternal H diet only during mating, gestation and breastfeeding induced cardio-metabolic disorders characteristic of human metabolic syndrome (MetS) that were transferred to F1 and F2 offspring, both females and males, even they fed control diet after weaning. This process probably occurs due to disturbance in mechanisms related to leptin that increases energy intake in F1H and F2H offspring. The present data reinforce the importance of balanced diet during the pregnancy and breastfeeding in health of the F1 and F2 offspring.

Effect of fatty acids on melanogenesis and tumor cell growth in melanoma cells.||||||||Fatty acids have various physiological effects on melanoma. For example, palmitic acid (PA) increases melanin levels; linoleic acid and DHA decrease melanin levels; and DHA suppresses tumor growth. In this study, we focused on the relationship between the structure of fatty acids and their physiological effects in melanoma to examine the likely mechanisms of action. We showed that saturated fatty acids and PUFAs display opposing effects on melanin content in melanoma cells. Likewise, PA and EPA have opposing effects in terms of actin polymerization. Our findings suggest that PA and EPA change melanin content in melanoma to alter melanosome trafficking by modulating actin polymerization. Here, we also examined the mechanism of the anti-tumor effect of DHA. We found that DHA interacts with receptor for activated C kinase 1 and represses melanoma cell proliferation by suppressing protein kinase C signaling. Our results suggest a new mechanism to explain the physiological effects of fatty acids.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors for hepatocellular carcinoma.||||||||The position of immunotherapy as a pillar of systemic cancer treatment has been firmly established over the past decade. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a welcome option for patients with different malignancies. This is in part because they offer the possibility of durable benefit, even for patients who have failed other treatment modalities. The recent demonstration that immunotherapy is effective for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a milestone in the history of this recalcitrant disease. The treatment of HCC has been a challenge, and for many years was limited to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib and to several novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors that have shown efficacy and have been approved. The current role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the management of HCC, and how this role is likely to evolve in the years ahead, are key. Other than efforts evaluating single checkpoint inhibitors, potential combination strategies, including combinations with existing local and systemic approaches, including novel therapies are evolving. This is understandably of special interest considering the potential unique immune system of the liver, which may impact the use of immunotherapy in patients with HCC going forward, and how can it be enhanced further.

Oral ionic liquid for the treatment of diet-induced obesity.||||||||More than 70% of American adults are overweight or obese, a precondition leading to chronic diseases, including diabetes and hypertension. Among other factors, diets with high fat and carbohydrate content have been implicated in obesity. In this study, we hypothesize that the choline and geranate (CAGE) ionic liquid can reduce body weight by decreasing fat absorption through the intestine. In vitro studies performed using docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a model fat molecule, show that CAGE forms particles 2 to 4 μm in diameter in the presence of fat molecules. Ex vivo permeation studies in rat intestine showed that formation of such large particles reduces intestinal fat absorption. In vivo, CAGE reduces DHA absorption by 60% to 70% compared with controls. DHA administered with CAGE was retained in the intestine even after 6 h. Rats fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) and 10 μL of daily oral CAGE exhibited 12% less body weight gain compared with rats fed with an HFD without CAGE for 30 d. Rats that were given CAGE also ate less food than the control groups. Serum biochemistry and histology results indicated that CAGE was well tolerated by the rats. Collectively, our data support the hypothesis that CAGE interacts with fat molecules to prevent their absorption through intestinal tissue and potentially providing a feeling of satiety. We conclude that CAGE offers an effective means to control body weight and a promising tool to tackle the obesity epidemic.

PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors in cancer: At the bench and bedside.||||||||Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is one of the major cellular signaling pathways that plays an important role in basic intracellular functions. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway regulates cell proliferation, growth, cell size, metabolism, and motility. Component genes of this pathway have been extensively studied and found to be commonly activated in human cancer. Inhibition of this pathway has been shown to lead to regression of human tumors and has been studied in preclinical setup and evaluated in many clinical trials at various levels. Some inhibitors of this pathway are approved by the Food and Drug Administration after their potency and safety have been shown in clinical trials. This review discusses the recent trends in exploiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway towards the molecular targeted therapy using small molecule inhibitors in human cancer.

Main derivatives of nitric oxide, such as nitrogen dioxide and peroxynitrite cause cell death by inducing protein and lipid peroxidation and/or DNA damage. Moreover, they control the activity of important protein players within the pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways. Thus, the control of intracellular reactive nitrogen species may become a sophisticated tool in anticancer strategies.

Repurposing of drugs as STAT3 inhibitors for cancer therapy.||||||||Drug repurposing is a valuable approach in delivering new cancer therapeutics rapidly into the clinic. Existing safety and patient tolerability data for drugs already in clinical use represent an untapped resource in terms of identifying therapeutic agents for off-label protein targets. The multicellular effects of STAT3 mediated by a range of various upstream signaling pathways make it an attractive therapeutic target with utility in a range of diseases including cancer, and has led to the development of a variety of STAT3 inhibitors. Moreover, heightened STAT3 transcriptional activation in tumor cells and within the cells of the tumor microenvironment contribute to disease progression. Consequently, there are many STAT3 inhibitors in preclinical development or under evaluation in clinical trials for their therapeutic efficacy predominantly in inflammatory diseases and cancer. Despite these advances, many challenges remain in ultimately providing STAT3 inhibitors to patients as cancer treatments, highlighting the need not only for a better understanding of the mechanisms associated with STAT3 activation, but also how various pharmaceutical agents suppress STAT3 activity in various cancers. In this review we discuss the importance of STAT3-dependent functions in cancer, review the status of compounds designed as direct-acting STAT3 inhibitors, and describe some of the strategies for repurposing of drugs as STAT3 inhibitors for cancer therapy.

World Workshop on Oral Medicine VII: Prognostic biomarkers in oral leukoplakia: A systematic review of longitudinal studies.||||||||To identify the prognostic biomarker candidates for stratification and long-term surveillance of oral leukoplakia progressing to cancer via a systematic literature review.||||Systematic searches with no date restrictions were conducted on March 29, 2018, targeting the databases PubMed (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), EBM (Ovid), and Web of Science (ISI). Bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. Biomarkers were stratified based on hallmarks of cancer.||||Inclusion criteria were met by 25 of 3,415 studies. A range of biomarkers were evaluated experimentally for risk stratification, prognosis, and surveillance of oral leukoplakia in tissue, blood, and saliva. However, the studies were highly heterogeneous and require further validation. Biomarkers reported in these studies included inflammatory or oxidative markers, growth factors, ion channels, genetic and cellular regulatory factors, and epigenetic biomarkers. Studies tended to include small sample sizes, under-reported or variably reported histopathological data, did not address potential confounding, reported limited/variable follow-up data, or lacked a control group. Inclusion of subsets from chemoprevention trials may have introduced bias regarding reported malignant transformation rates and accuracy of prognostic biomarkers.||||This review identified insufficient longitudinal evidence to support validated prognostic biomarkers for oral leukoplakia. Further studies are needed to identify molecular targets with the potential to mitigate risk of malignant transformation.

Circulating biomarkers in patients with glioblastoma.||||||||Gliomas are the most common tumours of the central nervous system and the most aggressive form is glioblastoma (GBM). Despite advances in treatment, patient survival remains low. GBM diagnosis typically relies on imaging techniques and postoperative pathological diagnosis; however, both procedures have their inherent limitations. Imaging modalities cannot differentiate tumour progression from treatment-related changes that mimic progression, known as pseudoprogression, which might lead to misinterpretation of therapy response and delay clinical interventions. In addition to imaging limitations, tissue biopsies are invasive and most of the time cannot be performed over the course of treatment to evaluate 'real-time' tumour dynamics. In an attempt to address these limitations, liquid biopsies have been proposed in the field. Blood sampling is a minimally invasive procedure for a patient to endure and could provide tumoural information to guide therapy. Tumours shed tumoural content, such as circulating tumour cells, cell-free nucleic acids, proteins and extracellular vesicles, into the circulation, and these biomarkers are reported to cross the blood-brain barrier. The use of liquid biopsies is emerging in the field of GBM. In this review, we aim to summarise the current literature on circulating biomarkers, namely circulating tumour cells, circulating tumour DNA and extracellular vesicles as potential non-invasively sampled biomarkers to manage the treatment of patients with GBM.

Biomarkers in heart failure: the past, current and future.||||||||Despite the enhanced knowledge of the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF), it still remains a serious syndrome with substantial morbidity, mortality, and frequent hospitalizations. These are due to the current improvements in other cardiovascular diseases (like myocardial infarction), the aging population, and growing prevalence of comorbidities. Biomarker-guided management has brought a new dimension in prognostication, diagnosis, and therapy options. Following the recommendation of natriuretic peptides (B-type natriuretic peptide and N-terminal-proBNP), many other biomarkers have been thoroughly studied to reflect different pathophysiological processes (such as fibrosis, inflammation, myocardial injury, and remodeling) in HF and some of them (like cardiac troponins, soluble suppression of tumorigenesis-2, and galectin 3) have subsequently been recommended to aid in the diagnosis and prognostication in HF. Consequently, multi-marker approach has also been approved owing to the varied nature of HF syndrome. In this review, we discussed the guidelines available for HF biomarkers, procedures for evaluating novel markers, and the utilities of both emerging and established biomarkers for risk stratification, diagnosis, and management of HF in the clinics. We later looked at how the rapidly emerging field-OMICs, can help transform HF biomarkers discoveries and establishment.

Research in this field has included the use of in vitro and in vivo experimental models and has fostered the development and evaluation of tissue and biofluid assays for novel analytes with potential translation to the diagnosis and prognosis of kidney disease. Here, we examine recent advances in the search of "biomarkers" for detection of renal tubulointerstitial scarring and prediction of renal outcome in human renal disease.

Exhaled breath condensate biomarkers for lung cancer.||||||||Lung cancer is the main cause of cancer incidence and mortality worldwide and the identification of clinically useful biomarkers for lung cancer detection at both early and metastatic stage is a pressing medical need. Although many improvements have been made in the treatment and in the early screening of this cancer, most diagnosis are made at a late stage, when a lot of genetic and epigenetic changes have occurred. A promising source of biomarkers reflective of the pathogenesis of lung cancer is exhaled breath condensate (EBC), a biological fluid and a natural matrix of the respiratory tract. Molecules such as DNAs, RNAs, proteins, metabolites and volatile compounds are present in EBC, and their presence/absence or their variation in concentrations can be used as biomarkers. The aims of this review are to briefly describe exhaled breath composition, firstly, and then to document some of the EBC candidate biomarkers for lung cancer by dividing them according to their origin (genome, transcriptome, epigenome, metabolome, proteome and microbiota) in order to demonstrate the potential use of EBC as a helpful tool in cancer diagnostics, molecular profiling, therapy monitoring and screening of high risk individuals.

The Value of Combination Analysis of Tumor Biomarkers for Early Differentiating Diagnosis of Lung Cancer and Pulmonary Tuberculosis.||||||||Distinguishing early lung cancer from pulmonary tuberculosis is difficult. Biomarkers have been applied to tumor diagnoses widely. However, the ability for tumor biomarkers to uniquely identify either lung cancer or pulmonary tuberculosis remains controversial.||||The retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized with suspected pathological tissue mass in their thoracic cage, found via imaging, was conducted. The levels of tumor biomarkers CEA, NSE, CYFRA21-1, Pro-GRP, and SCC-Ag were measured and compared in patients with defined lung cancer (N=235) and pulmonary tuberculosis (N=224), respectively.||||<0.001). The combined detection of CEA, CYFRA21-1, and NSE was used to diagnose lung cancer with a specificity of 89.9%, and a sensitivity of 94.9%. The detection's accuracy was higher (AUC=0.972) than five tumor biomarkers alone or combined.||||The combination of CEA, CYFRA21-1, and NSE possesses better values for identifying lung cancer patients who are at a high risk of being misdiagnosed for pulmonary tuberculosis.

Canine Cancer: Strategies in Experimental Therapeutics.||||||||Cancer is the most common cause of death in adult dogs. Many features of spontaneously developing tumors in pet dogs contribute to their potential utility as a human disease model. These include similar environmental exposures, similar clonal evolution as it applies to important factors such as immune avoidance, a favorable body size for imaging and serial biopsy, and a relatively contracted time course of disease progression, which makes evaluation of temporal endpoints such as progression free or overall survival feasible in a comparatively short time frame. These criteria have been leveraged to evaluate novel local therapies, demonstrate proof of tumor target inhibition or tumor localization, evaluate potential antimetastatic approaches, and assess the efficacy, safety and immune effects of a variety of immune-based therapeutics. Some of these canine proof of concept studies have been instrumental in informing subsequent human clinical trials. This review will cover key aspects of clinical trials in dogs with spontaneous neoplasia, with examples of how these studies have contributed to human cancer therapeutic development.

Non-controlled, open-label clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of a dietetic food on pruritus and dermatologic scoring in atopic dogs.||||||||Canine atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common skin disease. The goal of this study was to evaluate food designed to improve skin barrier function and lower inflammation to reduce pruritus and clinical severity in client-owned atopic dogs. The food contained an antioxidant blend to reduce oxidative stress, plant polyphenols to stabilize mast cells, and polyunsaturated fatty acids to improve skin health and reduce inflammation.||||Seventeen dogs were included in the analysis. Initially 48 adult atopic dogs were enrolled and exclusively fed a dermatologic food for 8 weeks in a non-controlled, open-label study. Thirty-one dogs were excluded for the following reasons: oral and topical medication changes (n = 17), missing data (n = 4), fatty acid supplementation (n = 3), food refusal (n = 3), dropped out (n = 3), and owner concerns (n = 1). Using a scale from 0 (normal) - 4 (severe), veterinarians evaluated the presence and severity of clinical signs of atopy at weeks 0, 4, and 8. Pet owners also rated their pet's clinical signs of atopy on a scale from 0 (not present) - 10 (present continuously) at weeks 0, 4, and 8. Compared with initial baseline scores (median 19, range 3-69), the total veterinarian scores were significantly lower at weeks 4 (median 11, range 1-15) and 8 (median 7, range 3-46) (p < 0.05). Similarly, owner assessments showed significant improvements in the least squares mean (LSM) from baseline to 4 weeks (itching, redness, licking, and scratching) continuing to 8 weeks (itching, redness, and scratching) (p < 0.05).||||In this open, non-controlled study evaluating a dermatologic diet in seventeen client-owned dogs, owner and veterinarian assessments showed statistically significant reductions in clinical scores designed to measure severity of atopic dermatitis. While these results show promise for the management of canine atopic dermatitis, controlled clinical trials are also needed to affirm our findings.

This technique has important theoretical advantages, including the simplicity of acquiring blood samples, which can easily be repeated over time, its noninvasive and quantitative nature, which provides results consistent with the results obtained from tumor genomic DNA, and its speed and low cost. cfDNA analysis, as the leading tool to quantify somatic mutations, is a major technological leap in the noninvasive management of lymphomas. This technology may empower monitoring and treatment adjustment in real time and enable the quick detection of refractory lymphomas and resistance to routine therapies. Here, we summarize the results that have established the clinical relevance of cfDNA in diagnostic and prognostic stratification and the monitoring of lymphoma treatments.

Chikungunya virus drug discovery: still a long way to go?||||||||: In the last decade, and particularly since CHIKV reached the Americas, significant efforts have been made to identify compounds that effectively inhibit CHIKV replication. Unfortunately, these efforts have not led to a clinical candidate. For the years to come, more basic research is required to allow a better understanding of the interplay of the viral proteins among them and with cellular components. Structural information is missing for most of the targets so that structure-based drug design, a strategy that has provided good results in other antiviral fields, has been scarcely applied to this alphavirus.

Development of voltage gated transdermal drug delivery platform to impose synergistic enhancement in skin permeation using electroporation and gold nanoparticle.||||||||Owing to poor skin permeability, the transdermal (TRD) drug delivery at the required therapeutic rate still remains an arduous task. In the present investigation, a novel TRD enhancement strategy was introduced using the synergistic effect of gold nanoparticle (GNP) and skin electroporation. Diclofenac sodium (DS) was selected as a model drug. An electro-sensitive patch was constructed using skin adhesive matrix, polyvinyl alcohol/poly(dimethyl siloxane)-g-polyacrylate. GNP/carbon nanotube nanocomposite (GNP-CNT) was incorporated into the matrix with GNP and CNT to enhance skin permeability and electrical conductivity, respectively. Varying the concentration of GNP-CNT, alters the thermomechanical properties, water vapor permeability (WVP), drug encapsulation efficiency (DEE) and drug release profile, building a possibility to fine-tune the properties of the device. The membrane constructed with 1.5% GNP-CNT displayed the highest DEE and thermomechanical properties. The TRD DS release study was performed in rat skin at different GNP-CNT contents and variable conditions of applied voltage. Incorporating GNP-CNT enhanced the DS permeation profile with the best performance exhibited by device containing 1.5% nanofillers at an applied bias of 10.0 V. Electroporation in conjugation with GNP remarkably destroys the stratum corneum (SC) barrier by disparate mechanisms involving the breakdown of multilamellar lipid system, generation of new aqueous pathway and thermal effect. Furthermore, the dramatic disruption of lipid barriers generated by applied voltage was efficiently stabilized by GNP in addition to the transient and reversible openings created by them. Finally the safety of the device was confirmed by cell viability assay and environmental stability test. The developed skin permeation approach may open new avenues in TRD drug delivery.

Astrocyte molecular signatures in Huntington's disease.||||||||Astrocytes are implicated in neurodegenerative disorders and may contribute to striatal neuron loss or dysfunction in Huntington's disease (HD). Here, we assessed striatal astrocyte gene and protein signatures in two HD mouse models at three stages and compared our results to human HD data at four clinical grades and to mice exhibiting polyglutamine length-dependent pathology. We found disease-model and stage-specific alterations and discovered a core disease-associated astrocyte molecular signature comprising 62 genes that were conserved between mice and humans. Our results show little evidence of neurotoxic A1 astrocytes that have been proposed to be causal for neuronal death in neurodegenerative disorders such as HD. Furthermore, 61 of the 62-core gene expression changes within astrocytes were reversed in a HD mouse model by lowering astrocyte mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) expression using zinc finger protein (ZFP) transcriptional repressors. Our findings indicate that HD astrocytes progressively lose essential normal functions, some of which can be remedied by lowering mHTT. The data have implications for neurodegenerative disease rescue and repair strategies as well as specific therapeutic relevance for mHTT reduction and contribute to a better understanding of fundamental astrocyte biology and its contributions to disease.

Upregulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL in tumor tissue has been detected in about one-fifth of NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. However, the clinical relevance of the levels of AXL and its ligand GAS6 in plasma remains unknown.||||Tumor tissue and plasma specimens were collected from 25 EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients before EGFR-TKI treatment or after treatment failure. The levels of AXL and of GAS6 mRNA in tumor tissue were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and chromogenic in situ hybridization, respectively. The plasma concentrations of AXL and GAS6 were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.||||AXL expression was detected in three of 12 (25%) and nine of 19 (47%) tumor specimens obtained before and after EGFR-TKI treatment, respectively. All tumor specimens assayed were positive for GAS6 mRNA. The median values for the plasma AXL concentration before and after EGFR TKI treatment were 1 635 and 1 460 pg/mL, respectively, and those for the plasma GAS6 concentration were 4 615 and 6 390 pg./mL, respectively. There was no significant correlation between the plasma levels of AXL or GAS6 and the corresponding expression levels in tumor tissue.||||Plasma concentrations of AXL and GAS6 do not reflect tumor expression levels, and their measurement is thus not a viable alternative to direct analysis of tumor tissue in EGFR-mutated NSCLC.

In previous chapters, we introduced related research techniques and methods for studying chimeric RNAs. Here, we present an overview of the landscape of chimeric RNAs in bladder cancer and verification of two fusion transcripts which are associated with bladder cancer. We used bioinformatics to analyze the TCGA bladder urothelial carcinoma RNA-sequencing dataset, which contains 414 bladder cancer samples and 19 matched normal samples. We identified 19,547 chimeric RNAs and applied multiple criteria to avoid false positives, reducing this list to 271 high-confidence chimeric RNAs, 13 of which specifically expressed in cancer. We validated 6 of these chimeric in clinical bladder cancer samples, including CHFR-GOLGA3, which was found to be expressed significantly higher in bladder cancer samples in comparison to matched normal samples. We have determined that this chimeric RNA is produced by cis-splicing between adjacent genes (cis-SAGe). Further, we found that CHFR-GOLGA3 is mainly expressed in the nucleus, suggesting that it may not encode chimeric protein and instead act as noncoding RNA. Our findings establish the chimeric landscape of bladder cancer and provide a research strategy for how to conduct chimeric RNA research in other tumors.

Circular RNAs: A novel biomarker for cervical cancer.||||||||Besides messenger RNAs, recent RNA-Seq and biochemical analysis showed another type of RNAs as a product of splicing which is named circular RNA (circRNA). Evidence demonstrated that circRNAs are abundant in the cells and are able to show cell/tissue-specific expression or tissue developmental stage which suggest that circRNAs may have regulatory potentials. In recent years, researchers have focused attention on circRNAs because of their key functions in various cellular mechanisms. CircRNAs also have the potential to be as promising biomarkers for diagnosis of various diseases such as cancer. Growing up evidence has shown the various roles of circRNAs in multiple cancers. In recent years, cervical cancer as one of the main causes of cancer death in women has been interesting for molecular research. CircRNAs are one of the novel objects which have recently been evaluated in this cancer. The improvement in our knowledge of the roles of circRNAs in cervical cancer may lead to new transcription therapeutic approaches to cervical cancer inhibition. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to review many studies which examined the role of circRNAs in cervical cancer carcinogenesis and progression up till date and to summarize possible mechanisms of action of circRNAs in cervical neoplasm.

Emerging roles of circular RNAs in colorectal cancer.||||||||Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a newly discovered class of endogenous non-coding RNAs. Owing to the development of high-throughput sequencing, researchers have identified thousands of circRNAs. Emerging evidence suggests that circRNAs are involved in various tumor cell processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration. Because of their high stability and abundance, tissue-specific expression, and easy detection, circRNAs are considered ideal biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. An increasing number of studies have recently demonstrated that circRNAs are closely associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC is the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death globally. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the development and progression of CRC is vital. In this review, we summarize the current literature regarding human circRNAs related to CRC and present an overview of the potential clinical implications of circRNAs with respect to CRC.

Circular RNAs: an emerging landscape in tumor metastasis.||||||||Circular RNAs (CircRNAs), the endogenous long noncoding RNAs, unlike linear RNAs, are structurally continuous, covalently closed loops without 5' cap or 3' polyadenylated tail. High-throughput RNA sequencing has enabled the discovery of several endogenous circRNAs in different species and tissues. The circRNAs mainly act as sponges to cytoplasmic microRNA, aid in protein translation, or interact with RNA-binding proteins to generate RNA-protein complexes which control transcription. Recently, circRNAs have been reported to participate in cancer pathogenesis, particularly tumor metastasis in humans, mainly due to their frequent aberrant expression in cancers. However, the detail molecular mechanism of circRNAs activity in tumor metastasis is still elusive. Some specifically expressed circRNAs can potentially be used as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for tumor treatment. Further understanding of the network interactions and regulation of circRNAs is paving the way for the identification of better therapeutic strategies in tumor metastasis. In this mini review, we have summarized the current state of research on functions and mechanisms of novel circRNAs that regulate tumorigenesis and have evaluated the relationship between dysregulation of circRNAs and tumor metastasis.

Meningioma-like Tumor of the Skin Revisited: A Distinct CD34+ Dermal Tumor With an Expanded Histologic Spectrum.||||||||The term meningioma-like tumor of the skin (MLTS) was coined in 1993 to designate a particular whorled spindle cell superficial cutaneous tumor. No additional confirmed cases of this entity have been reported to date. Some authors have speculated that these cases might be cellular neurothekeomas. In order to delineate the histologic spectrum and the immunophenotype of this unusual tumor, we studied 5 cases, 2 previously unreported and the 3 original cases. The immunohistochemical findings of case 5, however, were limited to those from the original study. Clinically, the tumor presented as a reddish papule, plaque, or nodule, located in the extremities or trunk. The patient often referred to a recent growth of a longstanding lesion. Histologically, the characteristic whorled spindle and stellate dendritic cell population, commonly in a perivascular arrangement, and variable myxoid component, were consistently found in all cases. A prominent microvasculature was also a constant finding. The presence of large deciduoid cells was conspicuous in one case. A reticular pattern of multivacuolated cells giving a chordoma-like appearance was evident in another case. Tumor cells were diffusely positive for CD34 in all 4 cases studied, and negative for S-100, EMA, NKI-C3, CD68, and smooth muscle markers. No complete loss of retinoblastoma protein was found. No brachyury immunostaining was found in the case with chordoid features. No EWSR1 or NAB2-STAT6 gene fusions were found. From these findings, we demonstrate that MLTS is a distinct CD34 spindle cell benign dermal tumor, unrelated to cellular neurothekeoma, and exhibiting myxoid, deciduoid, or chordoma-like features.

Antiretroviral drug-S for a possible HIV elimination.||||||||Although the combination of highly active antiretroviral therapy (cART) can remarkably control human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) replication, it fails to cure HIV/AIDS disease. It is attributed to the incapability of cART to eliminate persistent HIV-1 contained in latent reservoirs in the central nervous system (CNS) and other tissue organs. Thus, withdrawal of cART causes rebound viral replication and resurgent of HIV/AIDS. The lack of success on non-ART approaches for elimination of HIV-1 include the targeted molecules not reaching the CNS, not adjusting well with drug-resistant mutants, or unable to eliminate all components of viral life cycle. Here, we show that our newly discovered Drug-S can effectively inhibit HIV-1 infection and persistence at the low concentration without causing any toxicity to neuroimmune cells. Our results suggest that Drug-S may have a direct effect on viral structure, prevent rebounding of HIV-1 infection, and arrest progression into acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. We also observed that Drug-S is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, suggesting a potential antiretroviral drug for elimination of CNS viral reservoirs and self-renewal of residual HIV-1. These results outlined the possible mechanism(s) of action of Drug-S as a novel antiretroviral drug for elimination of HIV-1 replication by interfering the virion structure.

Curcumin as tyrosine kinase inhibitor in cancer treatment.||||||||Curcumin is a natural substance known for ages, exhibiting a multidirectional effect in cancer prevention and adjuvant cancer therapies. The great advantage of using nutraceuticals of vegetable origin in comparison to popular cytostatic drugs is the minimized side effect and reduced toxicity. The targets in oncological therapy are, among others, tyrosine kinases, important mediators of signaling pathways whose impaired expression is observed in many types of cancer. Unfortunately, the hydrophobic nature of the curcumin molecule often limits its bioavailability, which is why many studies focus on the chemical modification of this compound. Current research is aimed at modifying structures that improve the pharmacokinetic parameters of curcumin, e.g. the formation of nanoparticles, complexes with metals or the synthesis of curcumin derivatives with functional substituents that allow tumor targeting. The article is a review and analysis of current literature on the properties of curcumin and its derivatives in the treatment of cancers directed to signaling pathways of tyrosine kinases and confronts the problem of low assimilation of curcumin with potential therapeutic effects.

Adiponectin for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.||||||||The metabolic burden caused by hyperglycemia can result in direct and immediate metabolic injuries, such as oxidative stress and tissue inflammation, in the kidney. Furthermore, chronic hyperglycemia can lead to substantial structural changes such as formation of advanced glycation end-products, glomerular and tubular hypertrophy, and tissue fibrosis. Glomerular hypertrophy renders podocytes vulnerable to increased glomerular filtration, leading to podocyte instability and loss. Thus, prevention of glomerular hypertrophy and attenuation of glomerular hyperfiltration may have therapeutic potential for diabetic nephropathy (DN). Adiponectin is an adipokine that improves insulin sensitivity in obesity-related metabolic disorders, including diabetes, but its efficacy is unknown. Moreover, the recently developed adiponectin receptor agonist, AdipoRon, shows therapeutic potential for DN. In this review, we focus on the role of glomerular hypertrophy in the pathogenesis of DN and discuss the role of adiponectin in its prevention.

Cholesterol-embolization syndrome: current perspectives.||||||||Cholesterol-embolization syndrome (CES) is a multisystemic disease with various clinical manifestations. CES is caused by embolization of cholesterol crystals (CCs) from atherosclerotic plaques located in the major arteries, and is induced mostly iatrogenically by interventional and surgical procedures; however, it may also occur spontaneously. Embolized CCs lead to both ischemic and inflammatory damage to the target organ. Therefore, anti-inflammatory agents, such as corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, have been investigated as treatment for CES in several studies, with conflicting results. Recent research has revealed that CES is actually a kind of autoinflammatory disease in which inflammasome pathways, such as NLRP3 and IL1, are induced by CCs. These recent findings may have clinical implications such that colchicine and IL1 inhibitors, namely canakinumab, may be beneficial in the early stages of CES.

A marked individual genetic variability concerning estrogens biosynthesis, metabolism and mechanism of action was recognized and associated with human breast cancer susceptibility, clinical features and progression. Although some genetic variations in canine ESR1 gene were reported, their influence in clinicopathological features and progression of canine mammary tumors has not been fully evaluated. This study aims to assess the influence of SNPs in ESR1 gene (rs397512133, rs397510462, rs851327560, rs397510612, rs852887655, rs852684753 and rs852398698) in canine mammary tumors characteristics and progression.

Can sodium fluorescein cause contrast-induced nephropathy?||||||||Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), and can be diagnosed when the etiology of AKI is unclear other than via a contrast agent. Fluorescent angiography (FAG) with fluorescein sodium dye is generally considered to be safe for patients with kidney diseases. However, it remains unresolved whether or not FAG can induce CIN.||||Patients from two tertiary hospitals who underwent FAG and had serum creatinine results within 4 weeks before FAG and 3 days after FAG between 2001 and 2017 were retrieved. Cases with concurrent iodinated contrast imaging or undergoing dialysis were excluded from the analysis. CIN was defined by two criteria: CIN criteria as >0.5 mg/dL or >25% increase in serum creatinine (sCr) level within 3 days after FAG, and contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CIAKI) criteria as ≥0.3 mg/dL increase within 2 days or ≥50% increase within 7 days after FAG.||||A total of 979 patients were screened, and we found 124 patients with AKI after FAG. After excluding 32 patients with clear causes of AKI other than FAG, the incidence rates of CIN were 7.3% by CIN criteria and 6.4% by CIAKI criteria. CIN incidence had a U-shaped distribution according to chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages in CIN criteria, while linear association between CIN incidence and CKD stages were found in CIAKI criteria. Kaplan-Meier curves showed the CIN group was significantly associated with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) progression (log-rank P < 0.001, in both CIN criteria and CIAKI criteria), and adjusted hazard ratios by multivariable Cox regression were 2.23 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.468-3.378] in CIN criteria and 2.17 (95% CI 1.462-3.232) in CIAKI criteria.||||According to CIN and CIAKI criteria, FAG may cause CIN and appeared to be a possible risk factor for ESRD progression. However, CIN or CIAKI criteria themselves may overestimate AKI and require meticulous attention to the interpretation of results.

Mechanisms of PARP inhibitor resistance in ovarian cancer.||||||||To summarize recently discovered PARP inhibitor resistance mechanisms and highlight the clinical relevance of these findings to date.||||A predominant mechanism of acquired PARP inhibitor resistance in homologous recombination-deficient cancers is the acquisition of homologous recombination proficiency as a consequence of secondary genetic or epigenetic events, such as secondary mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, or reversal of BRCA1 promoter methylation that restores homologous recombination and leads to PARP inhibitor resistance. Multiple other potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to PARP inhibitors including loss of DNA end resection inhibition (53BP1/REV7/RIF1/Sheldin) or DNA replication fork protection (PTIP/EZH2), but also increased drug efflux or induction of a reversible senescent or mesenchymal cell state have been described in ovarian cancer models. However, only few of these mechanisms have been identified in clinical samples.||||Multiple adaptive responses following PARP inhibitor treatment have been identified. Further research is needed to better understand what role these mechanisms play for clinical PARP inhibitor resistance and how these mechanisms may render ovarian cancer cells susceptible to subsequent novel combination therapies.

Identification, synthesis and evaluation of CSF1R inhibitors using fragment based drug design.||||||||Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor is a type III receptor protein tyrosine kinase belonging to PDGFR family. CSF1R signaling is essential for differentiation, proliferation and survival of macrophages. Aberrant expression of CSF1R appears to be an attractive target in several cancer types. Higher expression of CSF1R ligands correlates to tumor progression. CSF1R inhibitors have been shown to suppress cancers. We have attempted an in silico fragment derived drug discovery approach by screening ˜25,000 in-house compounds as potential CSF1R inhibitors. Using FBDD approach we have identified six diverse fragments that exhibit affinity towards hinge region of CSF1R. Some of the fragments 5-nitroindole and 7-azaindole and their derivatives were synthesized for further evaluation. The in silico and in vitro enzyme activity studies reveal moderate inhibition of CSF1R kinase activity by 5-nitroindole and good inhibition by 7-azaindole fragments. Bio and chemiinformatics studies have shown that 7-azaindole compounds have better membrane permeability and enzyme inhibition properties. Molecular docking studies show that the amino acid residues 664-666 in the hinge region of the cytosolic domain of CSF1R to be the preferred region of binding for nitroindole and azaindole derivatives. Further optimization and biological analysis would identify these fragments as potential and promising leads as CSF1R inhibitors.

'Shopping for a new body': descriptions of bariatric post-operative adjustment.||||||||Co-morbid conditions resulting from obesity cause 3.4 million deaths per year. Bariatric surgery has become a solution for obesity. Post-operative psychosocial changes can be problematic and must not be neglected. Up to 74% of people with overweight or obesity have body image distortion or dissatisfaction, which may persist even after surgery and weight loss. The questions addressed by this research were: (a) what are the categories of open-ended responses from bariatric surgery patients about their experiences of post-operative adjustment? (b) Do the categories of response support previous quantitative findings of a retained obese identity after surgery?||||Herman's Dialogical Self Theory provides the basis for understanding the post-operative transition from "I-obese" to "I-ex-obese". Fifty-five bariatric surgery patients (18-30 months post-op) were asked to tell the investigator about their adjustment after surgery. Their open-ended responses were written down and analyzed using content analysis.||||Individual responses were analyzed and divided into four dominant categories: (a) shopping for a new body; (b) relationship transitions; (c) focus on the new body; and (d) cheating on the fat person inside.||||This study presents an opportunity to gain perspective on the physical and psychosocial adjustment after bariatric surgery. The information can be used to guide pre-op and post-op education and counseling efforts for patients. Physical healing should be paired with healthy psychological adjustment to ensure a positive outcome.||||Level V, descriptive analysis of previous Level III research.
