Nerve growth factor (NGF) has an anti-tumor effects through perivascular innervation of neovessels in HT1080 fibrosarcoma and HepG2 hepatitis tumor in nude mice.||||||||This study investigated whether NGF prevents tumor growth by promoting neuronal regulation of tumor blood flow. HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells or HepG2 hepatitis cells were subcutaneously implanted into nude mice. On Day 21 after the implantation of tumor cells, human NGF (40 or 80 ng/h for 14 days) was administered using a micro-osmotic pump. Growth rates of both tumors were significantly inhibited by the treatment of NGF, and the survival rate was also extended. Significant suppression of HT1080 tumor growth lasted after withdrawing NGF. NGF markedly increased the density of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)-immunoreactive (ir) cells without changing neovessel density in HT1080 tumor tissues. Double immunostaining demonstrated protein gene product (PGP) 9.5-ir nerves around α-SMA-ir cells were found in HT1080 tumor tissue treated with NGF. The blood flow in HepG2 tumors treated with saline was significantly higher than in the non-tumor control area, but the tumor blood flow was markedly reduced by NGF treatment. In in vitro studies, NGF significantly accelerated migration of aortic smooth muscle cells but not endothelial cells, whereas NGF had no cytotoxic action on both cells. NGF inhibits tumor growth via indirect action, probably through innervation and maturation of tumor neovasculature, which regulates blood flow into tumor tissues.

[Nemaline rod myopathy treated with L-tyrosine to relieve symptoms in a neonate].||||||||Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a heterogeneous disorder defined by the presence of rod-shaped structures known as nemaline bodies or rods. The diagnosis is based on muscle weakness, combined with visualization of nemaline bodies on muscle biopsy. There is no curative treatment for nemaline myopathy. Therapeutic strategies for this condition are symptomatic and empirical. Herein, we present a newborn with severe respiratory failure and generalized muscle weakness, who was diagnosed as NM by muscle biopsy. The patient experienced remarkable decrease in sialorrhea and improvement of spontaneous movements after L-tyrosine treatment. This case is presented to emphasize the importance of muscle biopsy in the differential diagnosis of severe hypotonia during neonatal period and a possible benefit of L-tyrosine supplementation for decreasing sialorrhea and restoring muscle strength.

Neo Adjuvant Chemotherapy on Testicular Cancer after Scrotal Exploration: A Case Report.||||||||A case of testicular cancer treated with neo adjuvant therapy in a patient in male is rare. When testicular cancer presents, it is usually directly operated due to the size of cancer which presented within the order of operable size.||||Here, we report a rare case of a 5-year-old male patient presented to the emergency room (ER) due to mass on the scrotum without the difficulty of urination. From clinical findings, mass with a size of 15 x 10 cm was found with multiple abscesses on both sides of the scrotum. Pathological Anatomy Examination confirmed yolk sac tumour present within the scrotal mass. Initially, palliative chemotherapy took place to reduce the growth rate of the tumour. However, due to the responsiveness of testicular cancer to chemotherapy drugs, it reduced into operable size testicular cancer. Wide excision and Orchidectomy was then performed, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.||||This case report showed the possibility of using neo adjuvant chemotherapy as an alternative treatment when inoperable testicular cancer presented in hospital.

Personalized Decision Making in Early Stage Breast Cancer: Applying Clinical Prediction Models for Anthracycline Cardiotoxicity and Breast Cancer Mortality Demonstrates Substantial Heterogeneity of Benefit-Harm Trade-off.||||||||Anthracycline agents can cause cardiotoxicity. We used multivariable risk prediction models to identify a subset of patients with breast cancer at high risk of cardiotoxicity, for whom the harms of anthracycline chemotherapy may balance or exceed the benefits.||||A clinical prediction model for anthracycline cardiotoxicity was created in 967 patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor-negative breast cancer treated with doxorubicin in the ECOG-ACRIN study E5103. Cardiotoxicity was defined as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decline of ≥ 10% to < 50% and/or a centrally adjudicated clinical heart failure diagnosis. Patient-specific incremental absolute benefit of anthracyclines (compared with non-anthracycline taxane chemotherapy) was estimated using the PREDICT model to assess breast cancer mortality risk.||||Of the 967 women who initiated therapy, 51 (5.3%) developed cardiotoxicity (12 with clinical heart failure). In a multivariate model, increasing age (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.08), higher body mass index (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10), and lower baseline LVEF (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.89-0.98) at baseline were significantly associated with cardiotoxicity. The concordance statistic of the risk model was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.63-0.77). In patients with low anticipated treatment benefit (n = 176) from the addition of anthracycline (< 2% absolute risk difference of breast cancer mortality at 10 years), 16 (9%) of 176 had a > 10% risk of cardiotoxicity and 61 (35%) of 176 had a 5% to 10% risk of cardiotoxicity at 1 year.||||Older age, higher body mass index, and lower baseline LVEF were associated with increased risk of cardiotoxicity. We identified a subgroup with low predicted absolute benefit of anthracyclines but with high predicted risk of cardiotoxicity. Additional studies are needed incorporating long-term cardiac outcomes and cardiotoxicity model external validation prior to implementation in routine clinical practice.

Plasmablastic lymphoma presenting as a brachial artery aneurysm associated with haemodialysis arteriovenous access ligation in a renal transplant patient.||||||||Plasmablastic lymphoma is a rare and aggressive neoplasm, generally associated with immunodeficiencies and related to latent Epstein-Barr virus infection. This case is the first reported case of plasmablastic lymphoma relapse in aneurysmatic brachial artery wall.||||We describe the case of male patient who underwent cadaveric donor kidney transplant when he was 61 years old and radio-cephalic distal arteriovenous fistula ligation 8 months later. After 8 years, he developed gingival plasmablastic lymphoma treated with cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin and prednisone regimen with subsequent remission. During follow-up, a mid-forearm vascular access was created because of the worsening of renal function. Twenty-two months later, the patient showed a symptomatic 20 mm brachial artery aneurysm with radiological signs of imminent rupture, for which he was surgically treated. The histological evaluation of the brachial artery specimen revealed a relapse of plasmablastic lymphoma in the arterial wall and in an adjacent lymph node.||||Brachial artery aneurysms are a rare complication in kidney transplant recipients after ligation of arteriovenous access for haemodialysis. Here, we report a case in which this condition is associated with an even rarer plasmablastic lymphoma. A common aetiology, due to immunosuppressive therapy, is postulated for the two coexisting diseases.

An observational study of pregnancy and post-partum outcomes in women with prolactinoma treated with dopamine agonists.||||||||In women with prolactinoma medical treatment with dopamine agonists (DA) can restore fertility. A number of studies have established the safety of DA during pregnancy and the impact of pregnancy and lactation on remission of prolactinoma. However, the total number of reported cases remains modest and further evidence is needed.||||To evaluate the safety of DA during pregnancy and remission of prolactinoma after pregnancy and lactation.||||Retrospective cohort study (2002-2014) of 57 pregnancies in 47 women with prolactinoma who received DA. Neonatal and pregnancy complications were recorded. Prolactin levels and treatment data were collected at the time of diagnosis, pre-conception, during pregnancy and lactation, and post-partum (up to 114 months).||||DA treatment was stopped a median of 4.5 weeks after conception in 49 pregnancies (86%). There were 49 live births (86% of pregnancies) and six miscarriages. Six pregnancies had an adverse neonatal outcome including two with congenital malformations. Following 26% of pregnancies women achieved remission after birth or lactation, and 25% of women were in remission at last follow-up. Remission was associated with older maternal age (P = 0.036), a lower prolactin level at diagnosis (P = 0.037), and a smaller adenoma at diagnosis (P = 0.045).||||Successful pregnancy and lactation is common after DA treatment for prolactinoma. Fetal exposure in the first four weeks of pregnancy appears to be generally safe. Encouragingly, post-partum and after lactation a quarter of women had a normal prolactin level without medical treatment.

Bone mineral density, structure, distribution and strength in men with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy.||||||||Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) improves survival in men with advanced prostate cancer (PCa), but has been associated with compromised skeletal health and increased fracture risk. However, limited previous research has investigated determinants of bone strength beyond DXA-derived areal bone mineral density (aBMD) in this population group. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the effects of ADT in men with PCa on BMD, bone structure, estimates of whole bone strength and cortical bone distribution. A total of 70 ADT-treated men, 52 PCa controls and 70 healthy controls had DXA lumbar spine and proximal femur aBMD and pQCT distal (4%) and proximal (66%) tibia and radius cortical and trabecular volumetric BMD (vBMD), bone structure, strength and cortical bone distribution assessed. Analyses included BMI and/or tibia/radius length as covariates. On average, ADT-treated men had a higher BMI than PCa (P < 0.05) but not healthy controls. ADT-treated men had 7.2-7.8% lower lumbar spine aBMD than PCa (P = 0.037) and healthy controls (P = 0.010), with a trend for a lower total hip aBMD in the ADT-treated men (P = 0.07). At the distal tibia, total bone area was 6.2-7.3% greater in ADT-treated men than both controls (P < 0.01), but total vBMD was 8.4-8.7% lower in ADT-treated men than both controls (P < 0.01). Moreover, bone strength index (BSI) was 10.8% lower relative to healthy controls only (P < 0.05). At the distal radius, ADT-treated men had lower total and trabecular vBMD (10.7-14.8%, P < 0.05) and BSI (23.6-27.5%, P < 0.001) compared to both controls. There were no other differences in bone outcomes at the proximal tibia or radius. In conclusion, ADT treatment for PCa was associated with lower BMD and estimated compressive bone strength, particularly at trabecular skeletal sites (lumbar spine, and distal tibia and radius), compared to controls, but there were no consistent differences in cortical bone structure, distribution or bending strength.

Cancer-related symptoms, mental well-being, and psychological distress in men diagnosed with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy.||||||||There are known associations between treatment of prostate cancer (PCa) involving Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) and psychological and physical side effects. We investigate the associations between cancer-related symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQL), and poor psychological outcomes in men whose treatment for PCa involved ADT.||||A cross-sectional postal questionnaire was administered to UK men 18-42 months post diagnosis of PCa. Men completed items on functional outcomes using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26), EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Fatigue subscale. Psychological outcomes (mental well-being and psychological distress) were assessed using the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS) and the Kessler 6-item scale (K6), respectively. Associations between explanatory variables and psychological outcomes were assessed using stepped logistic regression.||||13,097 men treated with ADT completed a questionnaire. A minority of men reported poor mental well-being (15.5%) or severe psychological distress (6.6%). After controlling for sociodemographic and clinical variables, reporting clinically significant fatigue was strongly associated with severe psychological distress (OR 9.92; 95% CI 7.63 to 12.89) and poor well-being (OR 3.86; 95% CI 3.38 to 4.42). All cancer-related symptoms and HRQL variables were associated with both psychological outcomes.||||While the majority of men treated with ADT did not report poor psychological outcomes, a small proportion reported severe problems. Clinically significant fatigue was demonstrated as a possible indicator of poor outcomes. Healthcare systems need to have clear protocols in place which specifically and routinely target psychological distress and fatigue.

Development of recurrence risk score using 95‑gene classifier and its application to formalin‑fixed paraffin‑embedded tissues in ER‑positive, HER2‑negative and node‑negative breast cancer.||||||||We previously developed a 95‑gene classifier (95GC) to classify ER‑positive/HER2‑negative/node‑negative (ER+/HER2‑/N0) breast cancer as high‑ and low‑risk. The present study aimed to devise a 95GC recurrence score (95GCRS) to estimate recurrence risk more precisely and, although the 95GC was originally developed using fresh‑frozen (FF) tissues, this was applied to formalin‑fixed paraffin‑embedded (FFPE) tissues. 95GCRS was calculated using between‑group analysis and denominated as a value from 0 to 100. Correlation of 95GCRS with distant recurrence rate and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) was evaluated in 257 patients with ER+/HER2-/N0 breast cancer treated with adjuvant hormonal therapy at Osaka University Hospital and in 425 patients with ER+ breast cancer treated with NAC at Osaka University Hospital and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (GSE25066 dataset). Correlation of 95GCRS between FF and FFPE tissues was evaluated in paired tissues from 56 ER+/HER2‑/N0 breast cancer types obtained from patients without NAC treatment. Distant recurrence rates were remarkably low in patients with 95GCRS ≤50 and increased proportionally in patients with 95GCRS >50. Pathological complete response (pCR) rates to NAC were increased in proportion to 95GCRS, indicating a greater sensitivity of breast cancers with high 95GCRS to chemotherapy. 95GCRS was highly correlated (R=0.92) between FF and FFPE tissues, and the concordance rate (94.6%) of high‑ and low‑risk groups was also considerably high. Overall, the present study developed a 95GCRS that correlated with distant recurrence rate and pCR rate to NAC. The 95GC was applicable to FFPE tissues with a high concordance rate in FF tissues.

Impact of Arterial Hypertension on Doxorubicin-Based Chemotherapy-Induced Subclinical Cardiac Damage in Breast Cancer Patients.||||||||Advances in oncologic therapies have allowed to achieve better outcomes and longer survival in many patients with breast cancer. Anthracyclines are cytotoxic antibiotics widely used in daily oncology practice. However, anthracyclines cause cardiotoxicity which is a limiting factor of its use. Cumulative dose of anthracyclines is the major cause of induced cardiotoxicity. According to previous clinical trials, the major predisposing high-risk factors for anthracycline-based chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity are age, body weight, female gender, radiotherapy, and other diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Experimental studies in animals confirm that hypertension may be a significant factor predisposing anthracycline-based chemotherapy cardiotoxicity. The main objective of our study was to identify the effect of pre-existing arterial hypertension on the development of subclinical cardiac damage during or after doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. The study was performed prospectively between March 2016 and January 2017 in the Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Kaunas Clinics Department of Oncology and Department of Cardiology. Data of 73 women with breast cancer treated with doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in outpatient clinic were analyzed. Statistically significant association between pre-existing arterial hypertension and left ventricular systolic dysfunction after completion of chemotherapy was observed (P < 0.004). Our study demonstrated that pre-existing arterial hypertension has a very important role in the development of anthracycline-based chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity, despite arterial hypertension control quality. Consequently, further studies evaluating impact of other risk factors and how early and sufficient management of arterial hypertension could influence the development of cardiotoxicity are needed to avoid permanent cardiac damage.

Efficacy and safety of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for treatment of Plasmodium falciparum uncomplicated malaria in adult patients on antiretroviral therapy in Malawi and Mozambique: an open label non-randomized interventional trial.||||||||HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) require treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) when infected with malaria. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DPQ) is recommended for treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, but its efficacy and safety has not been evaluated in HIV-infected individuals on ART, among whom drug-drug interactions are expected. Day-42 adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) and incidence of adverse events were assessed in HIV-infected individuals on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART (efavirenz and nevirapine) with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine.||||An open label single arm clinical trial was conducted in Malawi (Blantyre and Chikhwawa districts) and Mozambique (Manhiça district) involving patients aged 15-65 years with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria who were on efavirenz-based or nevirapine-based ART. They received a directly-observed 3-day standard treatment of DPQ and were followed up until day 63 for malaria infection and adverse events. Day-42 PCR-corrected-ACPRs (95% confidence interval [CI]) were calculated for the intention-to-treat (ITT) population.||||The study enrolled 160 and 61 patients on efavirenz and nevirapine-based ART, with a baseline geometric mean (95% CI) parasite density of 2681 (1964-3661) and 9819 (6606-14,593) parasites/µL, respectively. The day-42 PCR-corrected ACPR (95% CI) was 99.4% (95.6-99.9%) in the efavirenz group and 100% in the nevirapine group. Serious adverse events occurred in 5.0% (8/160) and 3.3% (2/61) of the participants in the efavirenz and nevirapine group, respectively, but none were definitively attributable to DPQ. Cases of prolonged QT interval (> 60 ms from baseline) occurred in 31.2% (48/154) and 13.3% (8/60) of the patients on the efavirenz and nevirapine ART groups, respectively. These were not clinically significant and resolved spontaneously over time. As this study was not designed to compare the efficacy and safety of DPQ in the two ART groups, no formal statistical comparisons were made between the two ART groups.||||DPQ was highly efficacious and safe for the treatment of malaria in HIV-infected patients concurrently taking efavirenz- or nevirapine-based ART, despite known pharmacokinetic interactions between dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and efavirenz- or nevirapine-based ART regimens.

A post-hoc analysis of the FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 studies assessed the impact of smoking status on the efficacy and safety of indacaterol/glycopyrrolate (IND/GLY) 27.5/15.6 μg twice daily versus its monocomponents or placebo in patients with COPD.||||This post-hoc analysis of pooled data from the replicate, 12-week, placebo-controlled FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 studies compared the efficacy and safety of IND/GLY with that of IND, GLY, and placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. Baseline data from 2038 patients were pooled and grouped by smoking status (52% were current smokers and 48% were ex-smokers). The effects of treatment on lung function, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and safety were evaluated by baseline smoking status.||||Treatment with IND/GLY resulted in significant improvements in lung function measurements compared with placebo, irrespective of smoking status. Improvements in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire and transition dyspnea index were significantly greater than placebo in both current and ex-smokers, whereas changes in COPD assessment test were significant only among current smokers. Improvements in lung function and PROs were greater with IND/GLY compared with its monocomponents in current and ex-smokers. The incidences of AEs and SAEs were similar between current and ex-smokers.||||IND/GLY demonstrated significant improvements in lung function and PROs, independent of baseline smoking status. The safety profile of IND/GLY did not differ between current and ex-smokers.

Evaluation of response criteria in rheumatoid arthritis treated with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.||||||||Biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) used for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have several mechanisms of action. Interleukin-6 inhibitors (IL-6i) block the production of acute-phase reactants (APRs), which are some of the composite measures of disease activity. In this study, we examined agreement between the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response based on ESR or CRP, the Simplified Disease Activity Index 50% (SDAI50), and the Clinical Disease Activity Index 50% (CDAI50) response measures in patients treated with IL-6i and other bDMARDs.||||We enrolled 306 RA patients who started or switched bDMARDs. Treatment response at 6 months was analyzed. Kappa statistics were used to evaluate the agreement between different response measures. The contribution of APRs to improvement in disease activity scores was examined. Change of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score was analyzed in IL-6i-treated patients.||||Good agreement was achieved between response measures, with a κ >0.6 in patients treated with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 immunoglobulin fusion protein. In IL-6i-treated patients, the agreement was low between the EULAR response (ESR) and the SDAI50 or the CDAI50 (κ, 0.43 and 0.37, respectively). Under IL-6i treatment, APR improvement accounted for 56.0% of total improvement of the DAS28-ESR. When discordance was found between the CDAI50 and EULAR response in IL-6i-treated patients, all patients were classified as EULAR-only responders; there was no HAQ improvement in EULAR-only responders.||||EULAR response criteria overestimate the response under IL-6i treatment because the APR improvement largely contributes to the DAS28 improvement.

MECHANISMS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY: Estradiol as a male hormone.||||||||Evidence has been accumulating that, in men, some of the biological actions traditionally attributed to testosterone acting via the androgen receptor may in fact be dependent on its aromatization to estradiol (E2). In men, E2 circulates at concentrations exceeding those of postmenopausal women, and estrogen receptors are expressed in many male reproductive and somatic tissues. Human studies contributing evidence for the role of E2 in men comprise rare case reports of men lacking aromatase or a functional estrogen receptor alpha, short-term experiments manipulating sex steroid milieu in healthy men, men with organic hypogonadism or men with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and from observational studies in community-dwelling men. The collective evidence suggests that, in men, E2 is an important hormone for hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis regulation, reproductive function, growth hormone insulin-like growth factor-1 axis regulation, bone growth and maintenance of skeletal health, body composition and glucose metabolism and vasomotor stability. In other tissues, particularly brain, elucidation of the clinical relevance of E2 actions requires further research. From a clinical perspective, the current evidence supports the use of testosterone as the treatment of choice in male hypogonadism, rather than aromatase inhibitors (which raise testosterone and lower E2), selective androgen receptor modulators and selective estrogen receptor modulators (with insufficiently understood tissue-specific estrogenic effects). Finally, E2 treatment, either as add-back to conventional ADT or as sole mode of ADT could be a useful strategy for men with prostate cancer.

Impact of KRAS mutation status on outcomes of metastatic colorectal cancer treated with anti-angiogenic agents: a meta-analysis.||||||||The impact of KRAS mutation status on outcomes of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treated with anti-angiogenic agents is controversial. A total of 4,066 mCRC patients from nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included for analysis. The pooled results showed that the use of anti-angiogenic agents significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) in mCRC patients with KRAS wide type (HR 0.63, 95%CI: 0.53-0.75, p<0.001) or mutated (HR 0.55, 95%CI: 0.38-0.79, p=0.001). In addition, the use of anti-angiogenic agents significantly improved overall survival (OS) in mCRC patients with KRAS wide type (HR 0.78, 95%CI: 0.70-0.86, p<0.001) or KRAS mutant status (HR 0.87, 95%CI: 0.77-0.98, p=0.018). No publication bias was detected for OS and PFS in mCRC patients. The findings of this study show that the use of anti-angiogenic agents significantly improved PFS and OS in mCRC independent of K-RAS gene status. KRAS gene status does not significantly influence the activity of antiangiogenic agents.

Importance of the correct assessment of bone fractures in the clinical management of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with radium-223: A case report.||||||||Patients who undergo radium-223 treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) generally have a long history of androgen deprivation therapy and/or steroid therapy, which leads to bone loss and causes osteoporosis. Notably, Osteoporosis in combination with metastatic bone disease increases the risk of bone fracture. An 84-year-old man with multi-metastatic bone CRPC underwent six administrations of intravenous radium-223, which induced a good biochemical and clinical response. However, two months following the treatment, the patient reported acute pain localized to the lumbar spine mimicking bone progression disease and presented with stable prostate-specific antigen levels. A prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography scan showed no tracer uptake in that site, whereas a magnetic resonance imaging scan and subsequent vertebral biopsy confirmed the absence of cancer progression and showed the presence of vertebral crushing of L4-L5, which was probably due to an osteoporotic process. The patient had never received bisphosphonate therapy and refused it during α-emitting therapy with radium-223. The osteoporotic process, in association with metastatic bone disease, more easily leads to bone fractures that have an important impact on performance status, quality of life and prognosis quoad vitam in patients with advanced prostate cancer. Use of bisphosphonates or anti-RANKL antibody appears to be effective in improving bone mineral density. Notably, patients with multi-metastatic bone disease who undergo radium-223 therapy should be treated in conjunction with anti-osteoporotic therapy (bisphosphonates or anti-RANKL antibody) and adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Early recognition and differentiation of osteoporotic processes when determining the progression of cancer-associated bone disease is crucial in evaluating the response to radium-223 therapy and, consequently, for further therapeutic decision making.

Homologous recombination and DNA repair mutations in patients treated with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.||||||||Chemotherapy remains a cornerstone treatment in non-small cell lung cancer either in combination with checkpoint inhibitors or as subsequent therapy. Identifying molecular predictors of response allows for optimal treatment selection. We performed genomic analysis on tumor samples of patients treated with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel as part of a phase II trial to evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of mutations in DNA repair pathway in patients treated with this regimen.||||Next-generation sequencing libraries were produced using a capture-based targeted panel covering the coding exons of 278 genes on patients treated on clinical trial NCT00729612. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed as part of the clinical outcomes and correlated with mutation analysis.||||Of 63 patients enrolled, 25 patients had sufficient and acceptable DNA isolated from archival tumor samples for targeted sequencing. The most commonly altered pathways included DNA repair (DR) including Fanconi anemia and homologous recombination, JAK-STAT signaling, IGF-1, mTOR, and MAPK-ERK. Four patients with mutations in homologous recombination mutations had a shorter PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.54, 95% CI 1.2, 17.1, p = 0.026) and OS (HR = 6.3, 95% CI 1.8, 21.3, p = 0.003).||||In this analysis of patients with predominantly squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer treated with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel in a phase II trial, patients with mutations in homologous recombination pathways had shorter overall and progression-free survival.

Interference of hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid, hydroxyphenyllactic acid and tyrosine on routine serum and urine clinical chemistry assays; implications for biochemical monitoring of patients with alkaptonuria treated with nitisinone.||||||||We have assessed the effect of elevated concentrations of hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid (HPPA), hydroxyphenyllactic acid (HPLA) and tyrosine, on a range of chemistry tests in serum and urine to explore the potential for chemical interference on routine laboratory analyses in patients with alkaptonuria (AKU) treated with nitisinone and similarly implications for patients with hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1).||||HPPA, HPLA and tyrosine were added separately to pooled serum from subjects without AKU in a range of assays with Roche Modular chemistries. Effects on urine were assessed by changes in urine strip chemistries after mixing a positive control urine with various amounts of the test compounds and reading on a Siemens urine strip meter.||||No significant effect (p > 0.1) was observed up to 225 μmol/L of HPPA and HPLA, and up to 5000 μmol/L tyrosine, on any of the serum-based assays including those with peroxidase-coupled reaction systems of enzymatic creatinine, urate, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride. Both the monohydroxy HPPA, and the dihydroxy homogentisic acid (HGA), at increased urine concentrations typical of nitisinone-treated AKU and non-treated AKU respectively, did however show marked negative interference in strip assays for glucose and leucocytes; i.e. those with peroxide-linked endpoints. The effect of increased HPLA was less marked.||||In patients with AKU or on nitisinone treatment and HT-1 patients on nitisinone, urine strip chemistry testing should be used sparingly, if at all, to avoid false negative reporting. It is recommended that urine assays should be organised with a suitable specialist laboratory.

Further exclusion criteria were International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB grade 1 patients, follow-up time less than 3 months, receipt of pelvic irradiation or any form of systemic therapy (chemotherapy, aromatase inhibitor). Overall survival, disease-free survival, and pelvic recurrence-free survival were calculated with Kaplan-Meier methods. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyze factors associated with overall survival and disease-free survival.||||Among 131 consecutive patients identified, 111 (85%) patients met the inclusion criteria. The majority (98.2%) underwent lymph node dissection with ≥10 lymph nodes removed in 78.9%. With a median follow-up of 36 months (IQR 12-70 months), the 3-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and pelvic recurrence-free survival were 89.6%, 90.1%, and 92.8%, respectively. Histologic grade 3, older age, and lymphovascular invasion were not associated with inferior outcomes; however, lower uterine segment involvement (p=0.031), tumor size >4 cm (p=0.024), and <10 lymph nodes removed (p=0.032) were associated with reduced disease-free survival on multivariable analysis. Pelvic recurrence occurred in 12 (11%) patients, most often in the setting of synchronous distant disease (n=9), and was significantly more likely with lower uterine segment involvement.||||Among patients with stage IB grade 2-3 endometrial cancer treated with vaginal brachytherapy, the risk factors for recurrence (larger tumor size and lower uterine segment involvement) in conjunction with established risk factors (high grade, ≥50% myometrial invasion, and lymphovascular invasion) may identify a group of high-risk patients who might benefit from pelvic radiotherapy.

KIT and PDGFR-mutations were registered in all patients as well as the number of previous treatment regimens, patient's age as well as gender and the presence of contrast enhancement (vitality) in tumor. The lesion with the largest diameter was chosen and contoured using the spherical VOI tool. Inter-rater testing was performed by a second experienced radiologist. Regression and AUC analysis was performed.||||Ten variables could be confirmed to be significantly associated with disease progression. Of them, four textural parameters were significantly positively associated with disease progression and negatively with progression free survival (Glcm Id [grey-level co-occurrence matrix inverse difference], p = 0.012, HR 3.83; 95% CI 1.697-8.611, Glcm Idn [grey-level co-occurrence matrix inverse difference normalized], p = 0.045, HR 2.06, 95% CI 1.015-4.185, Glrlm [grey-level run length matrix] normalized, p = 0.005, HR 3.181; 95% CI 1.418-7.138 and Ngtdm [neighboring grey-tone difference matrix] coarseness, p < 0.001, HR 3.156, 95% CI 1.554-6.411). Single variables were shown to be significantly inferior to the combination of all variables. After 6 months, 90% of patients with 0-1 risk factors (group 1), 64.4% with 2-3 risk variables and 38.1% of patients presenting > 3 structural risk variables showed stable disease. Gclm Id, Gclm Idn and Glrlm non-uniformity were associated with the number of previous treatments, Glrlm non-uniformity also with tumor vitality (enhancement), whereas Gclm Idn and Ngtdm coarseness were associated with the number of tumor mutations.||||Some of the CT-textural features correlate with disease progression and the progressive free survival as well as with the number of gene mutations and the number of treatment regimens the patients were exposed to as well as with the tumor enhancement. All these features reflect tumor homogeneity.

Radiographic appearance of leptomeningeal disease in patients with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung carcinoma treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors: a case series.||||||||EGFR is frequently mutated in non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). Clinically available tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are effective in treating EGFR-mutant NSCLC. In this case series, we present five patients with TKI-treated EGFR-mutated NSCLC who developed leptomeningeal disease (LMD) lacking characteristic imaging findings. All five patients received TKIs prior to development of cytology-confirmed LMD. Clinical signs of LMD preceded radiographic evidence by 2-12 months. T790M, the most common resistance mutation to first-generation EGFR inhibitors, was identified in four cases. These cases illustrate that in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC, TKIs may effectively control LMD, creating a lag between onset of symptoms and observation of radiographic findings.

Real-World Adherence in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Treated with Trifluridine plus Tipiracil or Regorafenib.||||||||Trifluridine and tipiracil (FTD + TPI) and regorafenib (REG) are approved treatments for the treatment of refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This study assesses adherence and duration of therapy with FTD + TPI versus REG and explores the effect of sequencing on adherence.||||Adults diagnosed with mCRC were identified in the IQVIA Real-World Data Adjudicated Claims: U.S. database (October 2014-July 2017). The observation period spanned from the index date (first dispensing of FTD + TPI or REG) to the earliest of a switch to another mCRC agent, the end of continuous enrollment, or the end of data availability. Medication possession ratio (MPR), proportion of days covered (PDC), and persistence and time to discontinuation (gap ≥45 days) were compared between FTD + TPI and REG users and among switchers (FTD + TPI-to-REG vs. REG-to-FTD + TPI).|||| = .009).||||FTD + TPI users had significantly higher adherence and persistence, and patients who were treated with FTD + TPI before switching to REG also had higher adherence and persistence outcomes.||||Trifluridine plus tipiracil (FTD + TPI) and regorafenib (REG) prolong survival in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) but have different tolerability profiles. This study assessed real-world adherence to treatment with FTD + TPI versus REG and compared outcomes among patients who switched from FTD + TPI to REG and vice versa. FTD + TPI was associated with significantly higher medication adherence and longer time to discontinuation than REG. Patients treated with FTD + TPI prior to switching to REG also showed higher adherence outcomes. Findings could help inform decision making regarding the choice and sequencing of treatment with FTD + TPI versus REG in patients with mCRC.

Renal dysfunction in patients with radioactive iodine-refractory thyroid cancer treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors: A retrospective study.||||||||In 2014/2015, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were introduced as a secondary treatment for refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in Japan. While renal dysfunction is an adverse event of TKI, data on this adverse event in TKI-treated DTC remains insufficient. Here, we investigated renal function in patients undergoing TKI treatment for DTC and evaluated the efficacy of dose reduction/withdrawal for cases of renal dysfunction.A total of 73 cases of radioactive iodine-refractory DTC treated with sorafenib (n = 22) or lenvatinib (n = 51) were included. Patient data evaluated were TKI treatment period, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) before and after TKI therapy, incidence and degree (maximum value at time of TKI treatment) of proteinuria, and albumin levels before and after TKI therapy were compared.The mean ΔeGFR was -6.75% with lenvatinib and +5.90% with sorafenib. It was not significant (P = .15). The mean Δalbumin was -8.90% and -5.85% with lenvatinib and sorafenib, respectively; there was no significant difference between the lenvatinib and sorafenib groups (P = .77). According to our program of TKI dose reduction and withdrawal, all patients except 2 with diabetes were successfully continuing treatment.Overall, the present results demonstrated that renal function is negatively affected by long-term TKI treatment for RAI-refractory DTC. However, heightened proteinuria, decreased eGFR and albumin levels, and significant but apparently reversible renal dysfunction were more frequent with lenvatinib than sorafenib.

Role of multidimensional assessment of frailty in predicting outcomes in older patients with glioblastoma treated with adjuvant concurrent chemo-radiation.||||||||Our aim was to evaluate the impact of comorbidities, clinical and biological factors on outcomes in elderly GBM patients treated with surgery followed by concurrent radiation (RT) and Temozolomide (TMZ).||||Our sample includes 34 elderly patients with GBM who treated from January 2013 to December 2017. We collected data regarding age, extension of surgery, use of current medications, KPS, presenting symptoms, Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), Charlson Co-morbidity Index (CCI) and Frailty Index (FI). All of these parameters, measured before the start of RT-TMZ, were linked to clinical outcomes.||||With a median follow-up of 9.7 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 12.1 months and 1-year OS was 50%. In univariable analysis high KPS and total surgery were significantly associated with better OS. Also PNI, CCI and FI were a significant predictors of OS. At multivariate analysis KPS, type of surgery and FI remained a significant predictors of OS and, based on these parameters, we generated a prognostic score that, dividing patients into three risk categories, has proven to be a survival predictor, with an increase of the risk of death by 2.2 times for each increment of the score (HR 2.2, p = .0004).||||The appropriate management of elderly cancer patients with GBM is an important concern in oncology. Our data suggest that in elderly patients in good clinical conditions and with a low FI score, extensive surgery, when feasible without adding neurological impairment, followed by adjuvant RT-TMZ, should be considered.

Serum profile of transferrin isoforms in rheumatoid arthritis treated with biological drugs.||||||||In the chronic inflammation process in the course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), many alterations in the expression of plasma proteins, as well as their posttranslational modifications (including glycosylation) can occur. Taking into account the disturbances in protein glycosylation and the emerging new treatment regimens, the aim of this study was to assess the serum profile of transferrin isoforms in RA patients treated with biological drugs.||||The study included 20 patients (16 females and 4 males; mean age: 53.4 years; range: 24-67) with rheumatoid arthritis treated with rituximab. Serum samples were taken 3 times: before and 3 and 6 months during treatment. The isoforms of transferrin were separated by capillary electrophoresis (MINICAP electrophoretic system, Sebia, France) into five major fractions: asialo-, disialo-, trisialo-, tetrasialo- and pentasialotransferrin. The results were calculated as relative concentrations of each fraction.||||The median trisialotransferrin relative concentrations after 3 and 6 months treatment (4.40% and 4.10%, respectively) were significantly higher (p = 0.013, p = 0.009, respectively) than before treatment (3.50%). The levels of serum pentasialotransferrin were also increased 3 and 6 months following treatment (16.5% and 17.7%, p = 0.005 and p = 0.006, respectively) as compared to those before therapy (14.5%), while tetrasialotransferrin concentrations were lower (80.3% and 78.4%, p = 0.009 and p = 0.008, respectively) than before treatment (81.5%). Trisialotransferrin relative concentration correlated with Hb (p = 0.019), whereas pentasialotransferrin with PLT (p = 0.036) after treatment.||||This study indicates that treatment with rituximab of RA patients alters the serum profile of transferrin isoforms. Tri-, tetra- and pentasialotransferrin relative concentrations measurements can be a useful tool to monitor therapy.

Severe distal muscle involvement and mild sensory neuropathy in a boy with infantile onset Pompe disease treated with enzyme replacement therapy for 6 years.||||||||Enzyme replacement therapy in infantile onset Pompe disease has led to a new phenotype with features not known in the pre-enzyme replacement therapy era. We investigated the origin of a rapidly emerging and severe weakness of the foot dorsiflexors in a 7-year-old boy after 6.5 years of enzyme replacement therapy. Electroneurography yielded normal findings except low compound muscle action potentials of the extensor digitorum brevis muscles after stimulation of the peroneal nerves. Electromyography of the tibial muscle demonstrated a myopathic pattern. Tibial muscle, sural nerve, and skin biopsy showed a myopathy with empty and glycogen containing vacuoles, a mild loss of myelinated and unmyelinated axons, and a moderately reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density. These findings provide evidence for a severe distal muscle involvement and a mild sensory neuropathy evolving during the course of disease after long-term enzyme replacement therapy, thereby expanding the new emerging phenotype of infantile onset Pompe disease.

Clinical Patterns and Linear Growth in Children with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, an 11-Year Experience.||||||||An important goal in treating children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is to achieve a normal final adult height (FH). The aim of this study was to describe the clinical presentations and evaluate linear growth and possible factors affecting it in children with CAH.||||This is a retrospective study of 56 patients with CAH followed up in a tertiary center for 11 years. Patient's data including demographics, clinical, anthropometric, and laboratory information at presentation and during follow-up period were collected from medical records.||||Fifty-six children (31 females) with CAH were seen at KAMC-Jeddah over 11-year period and 91% were 21-hydroxylase deficient. Of these, 46.4% had hyponatremia and 28.6% had hyperkalemia (21.4% had hyponatremia and hyperkalemia) at presentation. Positive family history was documented in 53.6%. Ambiguous genitalia were present in 72% of females and the majority required corrective surgery. Males had significantly decreased HtSDS versus females and females had significantly higher body mass index. The HtSDS of children who had had higher 17OHP or salt-losing crisis during treatment was significantly lower than those who had normal 17OHP and those who did not have salt-losing crisis, respectively.||||The final height outcome in our patients with CAH treated with glucocorticoids is lower than the population norm. Proper control of the disease clinically and biochemically through strict compliance to medical therapy as well as close clinical and laboratory monitoring is an important key to achieve normal final adult height in these patients. Side effects, including overweight, obesity, and hypertension are true risk associations and need timely diagnosis and early management.

Patients were prescribed ENZA or AA+P at the treating physician's discretion. Computerized tests of 4 cognitive domains (Cogstate), patient-reported outcomes (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 [EORTC QLQ-30], Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue [FACIT-Fatigue], Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function [FACT-Cog]), and patient/caregiver surveys were assessed at baseline and 2 months. Safety data were collected.||||Of 100 treated patients, 92 were evaluable (46/arm). Baseline characteristics were similar, with mild cognitive impairment observed in ∼20% of patients. The FACIT-Fatigue demonstrated a statistically significant worsening from baseline of -4.00 (95% confidence interval, -6.61 to -1.39) for ENZA compared with AA+P, -0.01 (95% confidence interval, -2.40 to 2.38). Overall, more adverse events (AEs) and more AEs of fatigue were reported with ENZA versus AA+P (52% vs. 36% and 26% vs. 8%, respectively). Grade 3/4 AEs were similar (4% vs. 6%). Unique neuropsychiatric AEs reported with ENZA included amnesia, cognitive disorders, memory impairment, and confusional state; those for AA+P included cerebrovascular accident, presyncope, and spinal cord compression. Clinically meaningful cognitive decline was seen in 4 patients on ENZA versus 1 patient on AA+P. However, the overall mean changes from baseline for the Cogstate tests, the EORTC QLQ-C30, and the FACT-Cog assessment were similar and showed no meaningful change. Caregiver survey responses noted more fatigue with ENZA and more moodiness with AA+P compared with patient responses.||||Although baseline values were similar, more fatigue and neurocognitive differences were observed with ENZA compared with AA+P.

Total 43 patients (23 women; mean age 56 years) with normal baseline liver function tests (LFTs), availability of baseline (pre-chemotherapy) and first follow-up CT (median 1.7 months, interquartile range (IQR) 1.5-2.5) performed during chemotherapy were included. Two single-slice ROI of right and left liver lobe were obtained on baseline and first follow-up CT for TA. Texture features [mean, entropy, kurtosis, skewness, mean of positive pixel, standard deviation (SD)] were extracted using a commercially available software (TexRAD; Feedback Medical Ltd, Cambridge, UK). Changes in texture parameters between baseline and follow-up CT were evaluated with Wilcoxon signed-rank test for patients with and without LFT elevation during chemotherapy.||||Patients with LFT elevation (n = 34; 79%) showed significantly different mean, entropy, skewness, and SD (p values range 0.007-0.047) between baseline and first follow-up CT. No significant changes in features were observed in patients without LFT elevation (n = 9; 21%). In 19 patients (56%), first follow-up CT was performed before elevation of LFTs was observed.||||This proof-of-concept study shows that there are early changes in liver texture on first follow-up CT in patients with LFT elevation during 5-FU-based chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. In more than 50% of cases, these changes occur before LFT elevation becomes evident on blood tests.

Most patients had a digestive tract cancer (colorectal: 22%; upper digestive tract: 23%). We identified 1742 PDIs; 76.5% of patients had ≥1 PDI; 13% of the PDIs involved an ANA. In a multivariate analysis, cardiovascular disorders (ischemic heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and/or arterial hypertension) were independently associated with PDIs (p < .001, after adjustment for polypharmacy and tumor site/stage). A high number of PDIs between two daily medications was independently associated with the risk of unplanned hospitalization (adjusted-odds ratio [95% confidence interval] per PDI: 1.05 [1.00;1.11], p = .05), while polypharmacy was not.||||Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities were more likely to have a PDI. A higher number of PDIs may be an independent risk factor for early unplanned hospitalization.

Real world survey of hydrogen-controlled cancer: a follow-up report of 82 advanced cancer patients.||||||||Advanced cancer treatment is a huge challenge and new ideas and strategies are required. Hydrogen exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that may be exploited to control cancer, the occurrence and progression of which is closely related to peroxidation and inflammation. We conducted a prospective follow-up study of 82 patients with stage III and IV cancer treated with hydrogen inhalation using the "real world evidence" method. After 3-46 months of follow-up, 12 patients died in stage IV. After 4 weeks of hydrogen inhalation, patients reported significant improvements in fatigue, insomnia, anorexia and pain. Furthermore, 41.5% of patients had improved physical status, with the best effect achieved in lung cancer patients and the poorest in patients with pancreatic and gynecologic cancers. Of the 58 cases with one or more abnormal tumor markers elevated, the markers were decreased at 13-45 days (median 23 days) after hydrogen inhalation in 36.2%. The greatest marker decrease was in achieved lung cancer and the lowest in pancreatic and hepatic malignancies. Of the 80 cases with tumors visible in imaging, the total disease control rate was 57.5%, with complete and partial remission appearing at 21-80 days (median 55 days) after hydrogen inhalation. The disease control rate was significantly higher in stage III patients than in stage IV patients (83.0% and 47.7%, respectively), with the lowest disease control rate in pancreatic cancer patients. No hematological toxicity was observed although minor adverse reactions that resolved spontaneously were seen in individual cases. In patients with advanced cancer, inhaled hydrogen can improve patients' quality-of-life and control cancer progression. Hydrogen inhalation is a simple, low-cost treatment with few adverse reactions that warrants further investigation as a strategy for clinical rehabilitation of patients with advanced cancer. The study protocol received ethical approval from the Ethics Committee of Fuda Cancer Hospital of Jinan University on December 7, 2018 (approval number: Fuda20181207).

Use, effectiveness and tolerability of budesonide-MMX in ulcerative colitis: A real-life experience.||||||||Budesonide-MMX has an established role in the management of relapsing mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. Data regarding effectiveness and tolerability in real-life clinical practice are limited.||||The aim of this study was to assess the use of budesonide-MMX in ulcerative colitis, as well as short-term effectiveness and tolerability in real-life practice.||||We conducted a retrospective study of adult patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis treated with budesonide-MMX at four tertiary inflammatory bowel disease centres in Italy from June 2016 to February 2018. Demographic and clinical features of patients, the use of budesonide-MMX, disease course and concomitant therapy were recorded. The primary outcome assessed was clinical remission at 2 months.||||A total of 82 patients with active mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis were included in the study with a mean age of 45.9 years and a median partial Mayo Score of 4 (interquartile range 3-5). A total of 41 patients were male. Overall, 36 had extensive colitis, 38 left-sided colitis and eight proctitis. Treatments at the time of inclusion included 10 patients receiving biologic therapy, seven azathioprine and 54 mesalazine or salazopyrin. The main reasons for the addition of budesonide-MMX were clinical relapse (47.5%) or inadequate response to current therapy (39.0%). In total, 50% of patients achieved clinical remission, whereas 9.8% had clinical improvement. No response was noted in 40.2% of subjects. Using multivariate binary logistic regression, a moderate degree of activity was the main independent predictor of non-response. Eight significant adverse effects were reported in six patients with three discontinuing treatment.||||In real-life clinical practice, budesonide-MMX is commonly used in combination with other therapies, both for acute disease flares and for partial response to therapy.

Effectiveness of three different luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists in the chemical castration of patients with prostate cancer: Goserelin versus triptorelin versus leuprolide.||||||||To investigate the changes in testosterone levels and rates of chemical castration following androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) with goserelin, triptorelin, and leuprolide.||||We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 125 patients with prostate cancer treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists between January 2009 and December 2015. Changes in testosterone concentration during 9 months of ADT with goserelin 11.34 mg, triptorelin 11.25 mg, and leuprolide 11.25 mg were analyzed using a mixed model. The number of patients with serum testosterone below castration levels defined as various values (<50 ng/dL, <20 ng/dL, or <10 ng/dL) at 3, 6, and 9 months were also evaluated.||||Of the 125 patients, 59 received goserelin, 44 received triptorelin, and 22 received leuprolide, respectively. The lowest mean testosterone levels during 9 months of treatment were achieved in patients treated with triptorelin, followed by those treated with leuprolide, and then by those treated with goserelin (p=0.001). Significant differences in chemical castration levels were observed only at <10 ng/dL, with 54.2% of goserelin, 93.2% of triptorelin, and 86.4% of leuprolide treated patients (p<0.001).||||Three LHRH agonists showed comparable efficacy for achieving castration when the castration threshold was 50 or 20 ng/dL. However, triptorelin was the most potent LHRH agonist, achieving the lowest mean testosterone levels and the highest rate of chemical castration at <10 ng/dL testosterone.

Proton Pump Inhibitors Modulate Transport Of Doxorubicin And Its Liposomal Form Into 2D And 3D Breast Cancer Cell Cultures.||||||||The purpose of our study was to evaluate the influence of two PPIs (omeprazole (OME) and lansoprazole (LANSO)) on weakly basic anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) delivery to monolayer-cultured 4T1 murine breast cancer cells and tumor spheroids.||||The effect of PPIs on cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay. 3D cell cultures (spheroids) were formed using 3D bioprinting method. DOX and PLD penetration into cancer cells and spheroids at pH 6.0 and 7.4 was assessed using fluorescence microscopy.||||Both OME and LANSO did not reduce the viability of 4T1 cells at 100 μM and lower concentrations, and therefore, in further experiments, 100 μM of PPIs was used. At pH 7.4, both tested PPIs did not enhance DOX (5 µM) and PLD (concentration corresponding to 5 µM DOX) delivery into 2D cell cultures. However, in acidic conditions, both PPIs increased the amount of drug in cancer cells and their nucleus. At physiological pH they were not effective at improving DOX delivery into spheroids, but after 2 hrs of incubation, OME slightly increased PLD delivery into edge and middle zones. At pH 6.0, both tested PPIs significantly enhanced DOX and PLD transport into spheroids, but the positive effect on delivery was observed only within the first 4 hrs of incubation.||||Both OME and LANSO increased DOX and PLD penetration into monolayer-cultured cells at acidic conditions but did not show a positive effect on drug delivery at physiological pH. Also, pretreatment with tested PPIs slightly increased DOX and PLD delivery in the edge and middle zones of tumor spheroids. Thus, OME and LANSO are promising transport modulators of weakly basic drugs.

Cardiovascular Outcomes Associated With Clinical Use of Citalopram and Omeprazole: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study.||||||||Background Recent studies have raised concerns about the reduced efficacy of citalopram when used concurrently with proton pump inhibitors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the associations between clinical use of citalopram and omeprazole and the risk of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in an Asian population. Methods and Results A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan dated from 2000 to 2013. The study cohorts comprised 3882 patients with citalopram use alone, 31 090 patients with omeprazole use alone, and 405 patients with concomitant use of citalopram and omeprazole (as the exposed cohort), and 141 508 patients received treatment with antidepressants without the risk of SCA and/or proton pump inhibitors other than omeprazole (as the comparison cohort). The primary outcome was the occurrence of SCA. The hazard ratios and 95% CIs derived from the time-dependent Cox regression model were used to assess the association between the proposed drug treatments and risk of SCA. The adjusted hazard ratios of SCA was 1.32 (95% CI, 1.17-1.50) for citalopram use alone, 1.08 (95% CI, 0.98-1.20) for omeprazole use alone, and 2.23 (95% CI, 1.79-2.78) for concomitant use of citalopram and omeprazole. The cumulative incidence of SCA over the Kaplan-Meier curves was more pronounced in patients with concomitant use of citalopram and omeprazole than those treated with citalopram alone and omeprazole alone. Conclusions This cohort study demonstrated use of citalopram and omeprazole either in isolation use or in concomitant use to be at increased risk for SCA.

Metronidazole-Induced Pancreatitis: Is There Underrecognition? A Case Report and Systematic Review of the Literature.||||||||Acute pancreatitis (AP) is the most common cause of gastroenterological hospitalization in the USA, with a mortality ranging from 5 to 20%. Up to 80% of cases are caused by cholelithiasis and alcohol abuse. Less common etiologies that need to be explored include hypertriglyceridemia, trauma, ERCP, infections, and drugs. A number of medications are known to cause acute pancreatitis, with 0.3-1.4% of all cases of pancreatitis being drug induced (DIP). Here, we present a case of metronidazole-induced acute pancreatitis.|||| colitis. Lipase was > 396, and CT abdomen revealed peripancreatic fat stranding. She was diagnosed with AP, metronidazole was suspected to be responsible and hence stopped, and supportive management initiated. Her symptoms improved rapidly, and pancreatic enzymes normalized within 2 days. Of note, she had had an episode of acute pancreatitis 3 years ago, also following metronidazole use, with resolution at discontinuation of the drug. She had concurrently been on omeprazole during both episodes.||||Metronidazole is a commonly used antibiotic and is infrequently reported as a cause of DIP. Our review suggests the possibility of a dose-response and duration-response effect between metronidazole use and occurrence of pancreatitis. The most common presenting symptom and sign was moderate to severe epigastric pain and tenderness, accompanied by nausea/vomiting. Symptoms usually start within 2-7 days of starting the medication and usually resolve 2-5 days after discontinuation of therapy and pancreatitis treatment. The most common causative dose was 1-1.5 g/day. Our review also supports findings by Norgaard et al. suggesting that concurrent use of omeprazole potentiates the risk of metronidazole-induced pancreatitis.||||Metronidazole is a commonly used antibiotic that may cause metronidazole-induced pancreatitis, especially if patients are concurrently taking PPIs. Awareness needs to be raised amongst clinicians regarding this association, in order to correctly identify etiology of pancreatitis and discontinue metronidazole promptly when suspected as the causative factor.

Proton pump inhibitors can reverse the YAP mediated paclitaxel resistance in epithelial ovarian cancer.||||||||Several reports indicated that the expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP) was associated with multi-drug resistance. Acidic microenvironment increased by the overexpression of vacuolar-ATPase (V-ATPase) was also observed in tumor growth and drug resistance. We hypothesize that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), currently used in the anti-acid treatment of peptic disease, could inhibit the acidification of the tumor microenvironment and increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to cytotoxic agents. Thus, our objective is to explore the reversal of drug resistance by the inhibition of YAP through specific PPIs in the epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) cells. .||||We found that V-ATPase D1 was a positive regulator of YAP. Sub-lethal doses of the proton pump inhibitor esomeprazole (EMSO) in combination with paclitaxel (PTX) increased the PTX sensitivity in PTX-resistant EOC cells, as compared to PTX single treatments by inhibiting YAP and reserving pH gradient created by the V-ATPase D1. Moreover, sub-lethal doses of EMSO combined with PTX decreased autophagy and improved caspases independent apoptosis of PTX-resistant EOC cells.||||These results suggested that sub-lethal doses of esomeprazole reverse YAP-mediated PTX resistance through the inhibiting of both YAP expression and acidic tumor microenvironment created by the V-ATPase D1. Therefore, we think the use of PPIs represents a promising strategy to improve the effectiveness of anti-EOC.

Rowell's Syndrome Triggered by Omeprazole.||||||||Dear Editor, Rowell's syndrome is a rare disease, characterized by the appearance of erythema multiforme (EM)-like lesions in patients with lupus erythematosus. It was initially reported by Rowell (1) in 1963 and its existence as a separate clinical entity is currently under debate (2,3). A few cases may have been induced by drugs such as systemic antimycotics, antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and more recently proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). CASE REPORT We present the case of a 67-year-old woman with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) and EM-like lesions who fulfilled all the criteria for Rowell's syndrome. The patient had lupus arthritis for two years and was treated with oral methylprednisolone 8 mg/day and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg/day. She started receiving 20 mg of omeprazole daily for gastroprotection. The patient also had arterial hypertension with no current treatment, osteoporosis, and an L1 vertebral fracture. The dermatological examination revealed multiple erythematous infiltrated plaques involving mainly the sun-exposed areas (neck, chest, upper back, and shoulders). Cutaneous lesions had an annular or target pattern and a tendency to form hemorrhagic crusts and scales at the margins (Figure 1, A). The mucous membranes were unaffected. Histological examination (hematoxylin and eosin ×200) found epidermal atrophy, vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer, and sparse perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the dermis - features corresponding to lupus erythematosus (Figure 2, A). Single eosinophilic necrotic keratinocytes characteristic for erythema multiforme were observed in the epidermis (Figure 2, B). Direct immunofluorescence (IF) from lesional skin showed granular deposits of C3 on the dermo-epidermal junction. Lupus band test from sun-protected, nonlesional skin was negative. On indirect IF a speckled pattern antinuclear antibodies (ANA) with >1:1280 titers were detected. Anti-Ro (>200 U/mL) and anti-La (>200 U/mL) antibodies were also positive. The blood cell count and differential analysis were within reference ranges. The 24-hour urine protein test showed a non-significant proteinuria - 0.36 g/24h. Photo-testing was impossible considering the extent of the skin lesions. The therapeutic approach consisted of increasing the hydroxychloroquine dose to 400 mg/day, substituting PPI with famotidine 20 mg/day p.o. and ceftriaxone 2 g/day for the superinfection with Ps. aeruginosa, which led to a clinical improvement (Figure 1, B). The methylprednisolone dose remained unchanged due to already existing severe adverse effects. DISCUSSION The diagnosis was based on Zeitouni et al.'s classification (4). The three main criteria are as follows: lupus erythematosus, EM-like lesions, and speckled pattern of ANA. Our patient met all three major and one minor criteria, namely the presence of anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. As for the other minor criteria, RF was negative and no chilblains were found. Although there was a continuous time lapse (more than 1 year) between the initiation of omeprazole intake and the diagnosis of Rowell's syndrome, we suggest that the connection is probable. For instance, the latency differs depending on the incriminated medication in drug induced SCLE. Longer periods are reported for diuretics and calcium blockers, while the time interval is shorter for chemotherapeutic drugs and antimycotics (5). Our suspicions were further confirmed by the fact that the lesions improved promptly within a month after discontinuation of omeprazole and doubling the dose of hydroxychloroquine. PPIs are reported to be a major cause of drug-induced SCLE (6,7). According to Laurinaviciene et al., the most common drugs involved are PPIs, thiazide diuretics, antifungals, chemotherapeutics, statins, and antiepileptics (6). However, very few cases of Rowell's syndrome are found to be drug-related. The culprit drugs include: oral terbinafine (8,9), norfloxacin (10), sodium valproate (11) and esomeprazole (12) (Table 1). CONCLUSION Despite the common clinical and immunological features shared between SCLE, drug-induced SCLE and EM, Rowell's syndrome seems to be a separate entity rather than a coincidental association. Finally, according to our knowledge this case would be the second of Rowell's syndrome due to PPIs.

The implication of the crosstalk of Nrf2 with NOXs, and HMGB1 in ethanol-induced gastric ulcer: Potential protective effect is afforded by Raspberry Ketone.||||||||Ethanol consumption is one of the common causative agents implicated in gastric ulcer development. Oxidative stress plays a major role in the induction and development of gastric ulceration. NADPH oxidases (NOXs) and Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) are key players in ethanol-induced ulcers. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a ubiquitous nuclear protein, mediates various inflammation functions. However, the role of HMGB1 in ethanol-induced gastric ulcer is not yet elucidated. Raspberry Ketone (RK) is a natural phenolic compound with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In the present study, absolute ethanol (7.5 ml/kg) was used to induce gastric ulceration in rats. Raspberry Ketone (RK) (50 mg/kg) was given orally one hour before the administration of absolute ethanol. Interestingly, ethanol-induced gastric ulcer was associated with Nrf2 downregulation, which was correlated with NOX-1, 2 NOX-4, and HMGB1 upregulation, and was significantly reversed by RK pre-treatment. RK pre-treatment provided 80% gastroprotection. Gastroprotective properties of RK were mediated via antioxidant, anti-inflammatory (suppression of NF-kB and tumor necrosis factor-α), and antiapoptotic activities (reduction of Bax/Bcl2 ratio). Gastroprotective properties of RK were confirmed by histopathological examination. In conclusion, this study is the first to provide evidence to the role of HMGB1 in ethanol-induced gastric ulcer, and the crosstalk of Nrf2, NOXs and HMGB1. It also demonstrates that RK represents a promising gastroprotective activity comparable to omeprazole.

A bis-resorcinol resveratrol congener prevents indomethacin-induced gastric ulceration by inhibiting TNF-α as well as NF-κB and JNK pathways.||||||||-3,3',5,5'-tetrahydroxystilbene (designated as HST-1) against indomethacin (IND)-induced stomach ulceration has been established using a mice model. HST-1 reversed the adverse effects of IND on several inflammatory (myeloperoxidase, cytokines, adhesion molecules etc.) and ulcer-healing (cyclooxygenases, prostaglandin, growth factors and their receptors etc.) parameters in mice. More importantly, HST-1 down-regulated TNF-α and the TNF-α-mediated activation of NF-κB and JNK/MAPK pathways that are the key determinants in the IND-gastropathy. The effect of HST-1 on all these factors was significantly better than that of Resv, misoprostol, and omeprazole. HST-1 also did not induce small intestinal mucosal injury, unlike some of the proton pump inhibitors. On the other hand, Resv reduced activation of the prosurvival ERK1/2 pathway that may explain its contraindicative property in the gastrointestinal tract.

Concomitant use of drugs known to cause interactions with oral antiplatelets-polypharmacy in acute coronary syndrome outpatients in Finland.||||||||Use of oral antiplatelets (OAPs) is essential for preventing thrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Effects of clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor may be enhanced due to pharmacodynamic interactions, but as CYP substrates, they are prone to pharmacokinetic interactions too. The aim was to study polypharmacy in ACS patients following hospital discharge.||||This observational drug utilization study linked patient-level data from nationwide registers. The study population consisted of adult ACS patients discharged from Finnish hospitals in 2009-2013. Logistic regression was used to model the probability of drug-drug interactions with odd ratios for predefined predictors such as age, gender, and ACS type.||||In the cohort of 54,416 ACS patients, 91% of those treated with OAP received clopidogrel. Of clopidogrel-treated patients, 12% purchased warfarin at least once while on clopidogrel treatment. Old age, male sex, ST-elevation myocardial infarction as index event, and a history of previous ACS events were associated with an increased risk of warfarin-OAP interaction (p < 0.001 for all). Ibuprofen, and serotonergic drugs tramadol, citalopram, and escitalopram were the next most common drugs causing pharmacodynamic interactions. In general, concomitant use of drugs known to cause pharmacokinetic interactions was rare, but both esomeprazole and omeprazole were prescribed in more than 6% of clopidogrel-treated patients.||||Warfarin and ibuprofen were the most commonly used concomitant medications causing pharmacodynamic interactions and potentially increasing the risk of bleeding in OAP-treated patients. Esomeprazole and omeprazole were used in clopidogrel-treated patients although there are alternatives available for gastric protection.

Short-Term Proton Pump Inhibitor Use and Hepatic Encephalopathy Risk in Patients with Decompensated Cirrhosis.||||||||A window period of approximately 3-6 months is usually adopted in studies that evaluate hepatic encephalopathy (HE) risk in proton pump inhibitor (PPI) users. However, HE risk after short-term PPI exposure remains unclear. We explored the effect of short-term PPI exposure using a case-crossover study design.||||Records of patients with decompensated cirrhosis who had received an HE diagnosis were retrieved from the National Health Insurance Research Database. PPI use rates were compared for case and control with window periods of 7, 14, and 28 days. The adjusted self-matched odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) from a conditional logistic regression model were used to determine the association between PPI use and HE risk.||||Overall, 13 195 patients were analyzed. The adjusted OR for HE risk after PPI exposure was 3.13 (95% CI = 2.33-4.20) for the 7-day window, 4.77 (95% CI = 3.81-5.98) for the 14-day window, and 5.60 (95% CI = 4.63-6.78) for the 28-day window. All PPI categories, except omeprazole and pantoprazole, were associated with an increased HE risk. Irrespective of other precipitating factors, such as recent gastrointestinal bleeding or infection, PPI significantly increased HE risk.||||Short-term PPI use is significantly associated with HE in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Physicians should use PPI in these patients for appropriate indications, and carefully monitor signs of HE even after short-term exposure. Owing to the limitations of retrospective design in the current study, further study is warranted to confirm our findings.

Patients were divided into two groups (low or high melanocytic nevi count), and multivariate analysis was performed with regards to the presence and number of melanocytic nevi and drug assumption. A positive association between the use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy (P = 0.012) and a high melanocytic nevi count was found through multivariate analysis, after adjusting for sex, age and multiple confounding factors, such as freckles, phototype and a reported history of sun exposure and sunburns. Further prospective studies are necessary to establish whether women using oral contraceptives or on hormone replacement therapy should undergo periodic monitoring of pigmented lesions.

A total of 330 patients with chronic gastritis who were confirmed of H. pylori infection were enrolled in this study. 290 of them were initially treated patients and the 40 remained were patients with retreatment. Eradication assessment was performed at least four weeks after the completion of eradication therapy. Results showed that the eradication rates of the ilaprazole group and esomeprazole group were 91.4 % and 88.4 % for per-protocol (PP) analysis (p=0.41) and 89.0 % and 86.2 % for intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (p=0.48) in initially treated patients. Meanwhile, they were 75.0 % and 72.2 % for PP analysis (p=0.85) and 75.0 % and 70.0 % for ITT analysis (p=0.72) in patients with retreatment. The differences were not statistically significant. There was also no significant difference in safety between the two drugs. A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that demographic factors such as age, gender, alcohol, smoking, coronary heart disease (CHD), hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM) did not affect eradication rates. However, patients with higher DOB values and patients with atrophic gastritis had significantly lower eradication rates than patients with lower DOB values and with non-atrophic gastritis whether the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in eradication regimens was ilaprazole or esomeprazole. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the efficacy and safety of ilaprazole and esomeprazole were not significantly different both in initial treatment regimen and retreatment regimen of H. pylori infection in chronic gastritis and DOB values and type of chronic gastritis were to be independent risk factors for eradication failure. In addition, we discovered that a new quadruple regimen containing furazolidone and minocycline which achieved good efficacy and safety can be a promising option for retreatment of H. pylori infection.

Rowell's Syndrome Triggered by Omeprazole.||||||||Dear Editor, Rowell's syndrome is a rare disease, characterized by the appearance of erythema multiforme (EM)-like lesions in patients with lupus erythematosus. It was initially reported by Rowell (1) in 1963 and its existence as a separate clinical entity is currently under debate (2,3). A few cases may have been induced by drugs such as systemic antimycotics, antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and more recently proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). CASE REPORT We present the case of a 67-year-old woman with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) and EM-like lesions who fulfilled all the criteria for Rowell's syndrome. The patient had lupus arthritis for two years and was treated with oral methylprednisolone 8 mg/day and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg/day. She started receiving 20 mg of omeprazole daily for gastroprotection. The patient also had arterial hypertension with no current treatment, osteoporosis, and an L1 vertebral fracture. The dermatological examination revealed multiple erythematous infiltrated plaques involving mainly the sun-exposed areas (neck, chest, upper back, and shoulders). Cutaneous lesions had an annular or target pattern and a tendency to form hemorrhagic crusts and scales at the margins (Figure 1, A). The mucous membranes were unaffected. Histological examination (hematoxylin and eosin ×200) found epidermal atrophy, vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer, and sparse perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the dermis - features corresponding to lupus erythematosus (Figure 2, A). Single eosinophilic necrotic keratinocytes characteristic for erythema multiforme were observed in the epidermis (Figure 2, B). Direct immunofluorescence (IF) from lesional skin showed granular deposits of C3 on the dermo-epidermal junction. Lupus band test from sun-protected, nonlesional skin was negative. On indirect IF a speckled pattern antinuclear antibodies (ANA) with >1:1280 titers were detected. Anti-Ro (>200 U/mL) and anti-La (>200 U/mL) antibodies were also positive. The blood cell count and differential analysis were within reference ranges. The 24-hour urine protein test showed a non-significant proteinuria - 0.36 g/24h. Photo-testing was impossible considering the extent of the skin lesions. The therapeutic approach consisted of increasing the hydroxychloroquine dose to 400 mg/day, substituting PPI with famotidine 20 mg/day p.o. and ceftriaxone 2 g/day for the superinfection with Ps. aeruginosa, which led to a clinical improvement (Figure 1, B). The methylprednisolone dose remained unchanged due to already existing severe adverse effects. DISCUSSION The diagnosis was based on Zeitouni et al.'s classification (4). The three main criteria are as follows: lupus erythematosus, EM-like lesions, and speckled pattern of ANA. Our patient met all three major and one minor criteria, namely the presence of anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. As for the other minor criteria, RF was negative and no chilblains were found. Although there was a continuous time lapse (more than 1 year) between the initiation of omeprazole intake and the diagnosis of Rowell's syndrome, we suggest that the connection is probable. For instance, the latency differs depending on the incriminated medication in drug induced SCLE. Longer periods are reported for diuretics and calcium blockers, while the time interval is shorter for chemotherapeutic drugs and antimycotics (5). Our suspicions were further confirmed by the fact that the lesions improved promptly within a month after discontinuation of omeprazole and doubling the dose of hydroxychloroquine. PPIs are reported to be a major cause of drug-induced SCLE (6,7). According to Laurinaviciene et al., the most common drugs involved are PPIs, thiazide diuretics, antifungals, chemotherapeutics, statins, and antiepileptics (6). However, very few cases of Rowell's syndrome are found to be drug-related. The culprit drugs include: oral terbinafine (8,9), norfloxacin (10), sodium valproate (11) and esomeprazole (12) (Table 1). CONCLUSION Despite the common clinical and immunological features shared between SCLE, drug-induced SCLE and EM, Rowell's syndrome seems to be a separate entity rather than a coincidental association. Finally, according to our knowledge this case would be the second of Rowell's syndrome due to PPIs.

DOX and PLD penetration into cancer cells and spheroids at pH 6.0 and 7.4 was assessed using fluorescence microscopy.||||Both OME and LANSO did not reduce the viability of 4T1 cells at 100 μM and lower concentrations, and therefore, in further experiments, 100 μM of PPIs was used. At pH 7.4, both tested PPIs did not enhance DOX (5 µM) and PLD (concentration corresponding to 5 µM DOX) delivery into 2D cell cultures. However, in acidic conditions, both PPIs increased the amount of drug in cancer cells and their nucleus. At physiological pH they were not effective at improving DOX delivery into spheroids, but after 2 hrs of incubation, OME slightly increased PLD delivery into edge and middle zones. At pH 6.0, both tested PPIs significantly enhanced DOX and PLD transport into spheroids, but the positive effect on delivery was observed only within the first 4 hrs of incubation.||||Both OME and LANSO increased DOX and PLD penetration into monolayer-cultured cells at acidic conditions but did not show a positive effect on drug delivery at physiological pH. Also, pretreatment with tested PPIs slightly increased DOX and PLD delivery in the edge and middle zones of tumor spheroids. Thus, OME and LANSO are promising transport modulators of weakly basic drugs.

A comparative study on the possible protective effect of esomeprazole, spirulina, wheatgrass on indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer in male albino rats.||||||||Gastric ulcer is a common problem affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Spirulina and wheatgrass are natural substances that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. The aim of the Work was to elucidate the possible protective role of spirulina and wheatgrass versus standard treatment esomeprazole on indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer in adult male albino rats. Eighty adult male albino rats were divided into eight groups: group I (the control group), group II that received indomethacin (100 mg/kg orally), group III that received esomeprazole (20 mg/kg orally), group IV that received spirulina (1000 mg/kg orally), group V that received wheatgrass (1000 mg/kg orally), group VI that received indomethacin (100 mg/kg) + esomeprazole (20 mg/kg), group VII that received indomethacin (100 mg/kg) + spirulina (1000 mg/kg) and group VIII that received indomethacin (100 mg/kg) + wheatgrass (1000 mg/kg). Six hours after indomethacin treatment, all rats were anesthetized and their stomachs obtained for measures of gastric acidity, pepsin activity, mucin content, gastrin, ulcer index, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), tumor necrosis factor -α (TNF-α), interleukin-8 (IL8), proapoptotic protein (Bax). Histological (using H&E stain, PAS reaction) and immunohistochemical (using anti Ki67 immunostain) techniques were performed. Western immunoblot analysis for heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) was also done. Moreover, a morphometric study was done for area% of positive immunoreactive cells for Ki67 and optical density and area% of PAS reaction. All performed measurements were followed by statistical analysis. Indomethacin induced loss of normal architecture of gastric mucosa with sloughing of surface epithelium and inflammatory cellular infiltration. It also led to a significant increase in gastric acidity, inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-8), pro-apoptotic protein Bax and a significant decrease in TAC levels and HSP-70 expression. There was also a significant decrease in area% of Ki67 immunoreactivity and area% and optical density of PAS reaction as compared with the control group and other pre-treated rats. These disturbed parameters were associated with increased ulcer index. In pre-treatment groups, the structure of the mucosa was similar to control with marked improvement in the biochemical assay. In conclusion, Spirulina and wheatgrass can partly protect the gastric mucosa against indomethacin-induced damage to a degree similar to that of the classical treatment esomeprazole.

STW 5 is effective against nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induced gastro-duodenal lesions in rats.||||||||Proton pump inhibitors are often used to prevent gastro-intestinal lesions induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, they are not always effective against both gastric and duodenal lesions and their use is not devoid of side effects.||||To explore the mechanisms mediating the clinical efficacy of STW 5 in gastro-duodenal lesions induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), exemplified here by diclofenac, in a comparison to omeprazole.||||Gastro-duodenal lesions were induced in rats by oral administration of diclofenac (5 mg/kg) for 6 successive days. One group was given concurrently STW 5 (5 mL/kg) while another was given omeprazole (20 mg/kg). A day later, animals were sacrificed, stomach and duodenum excised and divided into 2 segments: One for histological examination and one for measuring inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukins-1β and 10), oxidative stress enzyme (heme oxygenase-1) and apoptosis regulator (B-cell lymphoma 2).||||Diclofenac caused overt histological damage in both tissues, associated with parallel changes in all parameters measured. STW 5 and omeprazole effectively prevented these changes, but STW 5 superseded omeprazole in protecting against histological damage, particularly in the duodenum.||||The findings support the therapeutic usefulness of STW 5 and its superiority over omeprazole as adjuvant therapy to NSAIDs to protect against their possible gastro-duodenal side effects.

Esophageal hypersensitivity and acid contribute to the disease. However, the exact underlying mechanism of action remains unclear. In this study, we observed the effect of HWJND on esophageal morphology in a rat model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced visceral hypersensitivity followed by acid exposure. Esophageal morphology was assessed by measuring the extent of dilated intercellular spaces (DIS), desmosome disruption, and mitochondrial fragmentation. HWJND in low, moderate, and high doses relieved DIS and desmosome disruption in esophageal epithelium compared with model group (P&lt;0.05 for all doses). In addition, HWJND in high dose protected mitochondria from fragmentation (P&lt;0.05). Other findings suggest that DIS and mitochondrial fragmentation are independent events, and that omeprazole protects mitochondria. Overall, HWJND significantly resists esophageal morphology changes in OVA-induced and acid exposure rat model.

Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of oral gabapentin on the improvement of GI symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD) resistant to conventional treatments.||||In a double-blind clinical trial, 126 patients with FD resistant to conventional treatments, referred to gastroenterology clinic of Hajar Hospital of Shahrekord in 2017-2018, were randomly assigned to two groups; patients in the control group received omeprazole alone, and the case group received omeprazole plus gabapentin. The severity of GI symptoms was recorded and evaluated by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) questionnaire before and after treatment (4 weeks).|||| = 0.036). It also found that gabapentin, as an adjunctive drug, plus omeprazole could play a significant role in GI symptom improvement, such as pain, reflux, and indigestion.||||Gabapentin as an adjunctive drug could be more effective in reducing the severity of GI symptoms in patients with dyspepsia, especially neurological symptoms (such as pain, reflux, and indigestion).

Drug consumption and melanocytic nevi: correlation between oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy and a high melanocytic nevi count.||||||||The prolonged use of drugs such as beta-blockers, acetylsalicylic acid, omeprazole, statins, oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy might have some role in melanocytic nevi development and be ultimately linked to melanoma risk. Aims of the study were to evaluate a possible association between the above-mentioned drugs and features such as number and atypia of melanocytic nevi in long-term users. We retrospectively looked at pharmacological, clinical and dermoscopic records of 1321 patients that attended our unit for routine mole check between January 2013 and January 2018. Patients were divided into two groups (low or high melanocytic nevi count), and multivariate analysis was performed with regards to the presence and number of melanocytic nevi and drug assumption. A positive association between the use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy (P = 0.012) and a high melanocytic nevi count was found through multivariate analysis, after adjusting for sex, age and multiple confounding factors, such as freckles, phototype and a reported history of sun exposure and sunburns. Further prospective studies are necessary to establish whether women using oral contraceptives or on hormone replacement therapy should undergo periodic monitoring of pigmented lesions.

Methyl palmitate (MP) has demonstrated marked hepato-, cardio- and pulmonary protective features; however, its effects on ethanol-induced gastric injury have not been studied. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential gastroprotective activity of MP against ethanol-evoked gastric mucosal damage in rats and associated molecular mechanisms, for example, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and phosphoinositide 3 kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathways. The rat stomachs were examined in terms of the inflammatory, oxidative, and apoptotic perturbations. Current data demonstrated that pretreatment with MP attenuated the gross gastric damage, scores of ulcer index, area of mucosal lesions and histopathology outcomes; actions which were similar to the reference antiulcer omeprazole. MP inhibited NF-κB expression, its nuclear translocation, and the expression of its downstream signals, for example, tumor necrosis factor-α and myeloperoxidase besides restoration of interleukin-10 levels. Western blot analysis revealed that MP counteracted the disruption of MAPKs signaling via lowering p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 (p-JNK1/2) expression and restoring the phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2) levels without affecting p-p38MAPK levels. Additionally, MP improved the antioxidant milieu via diminishing lipid peroxides and enhancing glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, total antioxidant capacity and mucosal nitric oxide. In the context of apoptosis, MP inhibited the cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) and Bax protein expression with upregulating B cell lymphoma-2 expression (Bcl-2), thus, promoting gastric cellular survival. This was confirmed by MP activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway manifested by enhanced expression of PI3K p110α and p-AKT. Together, the present findings report the gastroprotective actions of MP mediated via its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic actions. The underlying molecular mechanisms involve, at least partly, the modulation of MAPKs, NF-κB and PI3K/AKT transduction.

Occupational Airborne Contact Dermatitis Caused by Omeprazole.||||||||Airborne contact dermatitis (ACD) is a frequent condition, and there has been increasing recognition of the occupational origin of airborne contact dermatitis. ACD caused by drugs is often occupation-related and occurs mainly in healthcare workers who use the drugs for therapeutic aims and employees of pharmaceutical industries involved in the production of the drugs (1). Omeprazole (OM) is a proton pump inhibitor from the benzimidazole group used for treatment of gastric acid-related disorders (2). A 52-years-old female chemist had been working in a pharmaceutical company for 20 years. When working in the laboratory, she wore protective latex-free gloves, a mask, and glasses. Skin lesions started 6 months after she had started working in an analytic laboratory with omeprazole and azithromycin. Whenever omeprazole was being manufactured, the patient presented with eczema with scaling on the eyelids, face, and neck, with the hands subsequently being affected as well. The patient's skin lesions cleared during holidays and sick leave and worsened when she was working in omeprazole production. Topical corticosteroids were applied, which resulted in temporally regression of skin symptoms. We performed patch tests with the baseline series (Chemotechnique Diagnostics, Vellinge, Sweden, and Imunološki zavod, Zagreb, Croatia) to materials in the patient's workplace and a lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) to omeprazole. All tests were negative, except the patch test to OM which showed a positive reaction (+) to 0.1% OM in saline solution on day (D) 2 and D3 and positive reaction (+) to 0.5% OM in saline solution on D2 and ++ on D3 (Figure 1). Hausen et al. performed experimental animal studies in which they concluded that OM and other proton pump inhibitors constitute a high-sensitizing-potential group (3). However, when administrated, orally or parenterally, the frequency of contact sensitization was low (3). Although direct contact with the skin was not always present, distribution of the dust containing OM through the air and deposition on exposed areas may result in ACD. The first two occupational cases of ACD caused by OM among pharmaceutical workers were reported in 1986 (4). Since then, ACD caused by OM in an occupational setting has been reported occasionally (2,4-6). Other proton pump inhibitors such as lansoprazole and pantoprazole have less pronounced potential to cause ACD (7,8). Ghatan et al. conducted a study in 2014 in an occupational setting with 97 workers and reported 31 positive LTT tests and 28 positive patch tests; these results confirm a high risk of sensitization to OM from occupational exposure (6). Although direct contact with the skin is not always present, it is important to bear in mind that distribution of dust containing OM through the air and deposition on exposed areas may result in ACD.

Proton pump inhibitors attenuate myofibroblast formation associated with thyroid eye disease through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.||||||||Thyroid eye disease (TED) can lead to scar formation and tissue remodeling in the orbital space. In severe cases, the scarring process leads to sight-threatening pathophysiology. There is no known effective way to prevent scar formation in TED patients, or to reverse scarring once it occurs. In this study, we show that the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), esomeprazole and lansoprazole, can prevent transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-mediated differentiation of TED orbital fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, a critical step in scar formation. Both PPIs prevent TGFβ-induced increases in alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), calponin, and collagen production and reduce TED orbital fibroblast cell proliferation and migration. Esomeprazole and lansoprazole exert these effects through an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-dependent pathway that includes reducing β-catenin/Wnt signaling. We conclude that PPIs are potentially useful therapies for preventing or treating TED by reducing the myofibroblast accumulation that occurs in the disease.

Proton pump inhibitors block iron absorption through direct regulation of hepcidin via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated pathway.||||||||Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been used worldwide to treat gastrointestinal disorders. A recent study showed that long-term use of PPIs caused iron deficiency; however, it is unclear whether PPIs affect iron metabolism directly. We investigated the effect of PPIs on the peptide hepcidin, an important iron regulatory hormone. First, we used the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database and analyzed the influence of PPIs. We found that PPIs, as well as H2 blockers, increased the odds ratio of iron-deficient anemia. Next, HepG2 cells were used to examine the action of PPIs and H2 blockers on hepcidin. PPIs augmented hepcidin expression, while H2 blockers did not. In fact, the PPI omeprazole increased hepcidin secretion, and omeprazole-induced hepcidin upregulation was inhibited by gene silencing or the pharmacological inhibition of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. In mouse experiments, omeprazole also increased hepatic hepcidin mRNA expression and blood hepcidin levels. In mice treated with omeprazole, protein levels of duodenal and splenic ferroportin decreased. Taken together, PPIs directly affect iron metabolism by suppressing iron absorption through the inhibition of duodenal ferroportin via hepcidin upregulation. These findings provide a new insight into the molecular mechanism of PPI-induced iron deficiency.

Rowell's Syndrome Triggered by Omeprazole.||||||||Dear Editor, Rowell's syndrome is a rare disease, characterized by the appearance of erythema multiforme (EM)-like lesions in patients with lupus erythematosus. It was initially reported by Rowell (1) in 1963 and its existence as a separate clinical entity is currently under debate (2,3). A few cases may have been induced by drugs such as systemic antimycotics, antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and more recently proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). CASE REPORT We present the case of a 67-year-old woman with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) and EM-like lesions who fulfilled all the criteria for Rowell's syndrome. The patient had lupus arthritis for two years and was treated with oral methylprednisolone 8 mg/day and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg/day. She started receiving 20 mg of omeprazole daily for gastroprotection. The patient also had arterial hypertension with no current treatment, osteoporosis, and an L1 vertebral fracture. The dermatological examination revealed multiple erythematous infiltrated plaques involving mainly the sun-exposed areas (neck, chest, upper back, and shoulders). Cutaneous lesions had an annular or target pattern and a tendency to form hemorrhagic crusts and scales at the margins (Figure 1, A). The mucous membranes were unaffected. Histological examination (hematoxylin and eosin ×200) found epidermal atrophy, vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer, and sparse perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the dermis - features corresponding to lupus erythematosus (Figure 2, A). Single eosinophilic necrotic keratinocytes characteristic for erythema multiforme were observed in the epidermis (Figure 2, B). Direct immunofluorescence (IF) from lesional skin showed granular deposits of C3 on the dermo-epidermal junction. Lupus band test from sun-protected, nonlesional skin was negative. On indirect IF a speckled pattern antinuclear antibodies (ANA) with >1:1280 titers were detected. Anti-Ro (>200 U/mL) and anti-La (>200 U/mL) antibodies were also positive. The blood cell count and differential analysis were within reference ranges. The 24-hour urine protein test showed a non-significant proteinuria - 0.36 g/24h. Photo-testing was impossible considering the extent of the skin lesions. The therapeutic approach consisted of increasing the hydroxychloroquine dose to 400 mg/day, substituting PPI with famotidine 20 mg/day p.o. and ceftriaxone 2 g/day for the superinfection with Ps. aeruginosa, which led to a clinical improvement (Figure 1, B). The methylprednisolone dose remained unchanged due to already existing severe adverse effects. DISCUSSION The diagnosis was based on Zeitouni et al.'s classification (4). The three main criteria are as follows: lupus erythematosus, EM-like lesions, and speckled pattern of ANA. Our patient met all three major and one minor criteria, namely the presence of anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. As for the other minor criteria, RF was negative and no chilblains were found. Although there was a continuous time lapse (more than 1 year) between the initiation of omeprazole intake and the diagnosis of Rowell's syndrome, we suggest that the connection is probable. For instance, the latency differs depending on the incriminated medication in drug induced SCLE. Longer periods are reported for diuretics and calcium blockers, while the time interval is shorter for chemotherapeutic drugs and antimycotics (5). Our suspicions were further confirmed by the fact that the lesions improved promptly within a month after discontinuation of omeprazole and doubling the dose of hydroxychloroquine. PPIs are reported to be a major cause of drug-induced SCLE (6,7). According to Laurinaviciene et al., the most common drugs involved are PPIs, thiazide diuretics, antifungals, chemotherapeutics, statins, and antiepileptics (6). However, very few cases of Rowell's syndrome are found to be drug-related. The culprit drugs include: oral terbinafine (8,9), norfloxacin (10), sodium valproate (11) and esomeprazole (12) (Table 1). CONCLUSION Despite the common clinical and immunological features shared between SCLE, drug-induced SCLE and EM, Rowell's syndrome seems to be a separate entity rather than a coincidental association. Finally, according to our knowledge this case would be the second of Rowell's syndrome due to PPIs.

Evaluating the Effect of Oral Gabapentin on the Improvement of Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Patients with Functional Dyspepsia Resistant to Conventional Treatments.||||||||Dyspepsia is one of the most common gastrointestinal (GI) problems and is more prevalent in adults. Environmental hypersensitivity and anxiety and depression are among the factors that can cause this disease. In this regard, gabapentin as a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) analog used in the treatment of neuropathic pain and may be effective in controlling the symptoms of GI disorders. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of oral gabapentin on the improvement of GI symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD) resistant to conventional treatments.||||In a double-blind clinical trial, 126 patients with FD resistant to conventional treatments, referred to gastroenterology clinic of Hajar Hospital of Shahrekord in 2017-2018, were randomly assigned to two groups; patients in the control group received omeprazole alone, and the case group received omeprazole plus gabapentin. The severity of GI symptoms was recorded and evaluated by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) questionnaire before and after treatment (4 weeks).|||| = 0.036). It also found that gabapentin, as an adjunctive drug, plus omeprazole could play a significant role in GI symptom improvement, such as pain, reflux, and indigestion.||||Gabapentin as an adjunctive drug could be more effective in reducing the severity of GI symptoms in patients with dyspepsia, especially neurological symptoms (such as pain, reflux, and indigestion).

Protective effects and potential underlying mechanisms of sodium copper chlorophyllin against ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in mice.||||||||In study, we aimed to determine the mechanisms underlying the gastroprotective effects of sodium copper chlorophyllin (SCC) against ethanol-induced gastric ulcer injury in mice. First, the gastroprotective effects of SCC against gastric ulcer induced by ethanol were assessed. Then, biochemical, histopathological, immunohistochemistry assays, and western blot analysis were conducted to determine the possible mechanisms of action underlying the effects of SCC. Compared to the effects of omeprazole (OME) in a confirmed mouse model of ethanol-induced gastric ulcer injury, treatment with various doses of SCC resulted in up-regulation of Bcl-2 and down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Significant decreases in the levels of the malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and NO in the gastric tissues were observed. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokine analysis revealed that SCC treatment inhibited the expressions of TNF-α and IL-6, greatly reduced the phosphorylation level of IκB, and repressed the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65, which demonstrated that SCC inhibited the activation of the NF-κB pathway. The present findings suggest that the protective effects of SCC may be beneficial as a potential preventive and therapeutic agent for gastric ulcer through the NF-κB pathway. Taken together, SCC administration significantly decreased the levels of MPO, NO, and MDA in gastric tissue and exerted a powerful anti-inflammatory activity as demonstrated by reduction in the secretions of proinflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and TNF-α in the serum of mice exposed to ethanol.

Prodigiosins from a marine sponge-associated actinomycete attenuate HCl/ethanol-induced gastric lesion via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.||||||||Gastric ulcer is sores that form in the stomach mucosal layer because of erosion caused by high acid secretion and excessive use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Prodigiosins (PdGs) are red-pigmented secondary metabolites produced by bacteria, including actinomycetes. Butylcycloheptylprodigiosin (1) and undecylprodigiosin (2) were identified and isolated from a crude extract of the actinomycete RA2 isolated from the Red Sea Sponge Spheciospongia mastoidea. Chemical structure of 1 and 2 was determined by NMR and mass spectroscopy. Although their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are known, their effect on gastric lesion is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate gastroprotective effects of PdGs against HCl/ethanol-induced gastric lesion in rats. Oral pretreatment with PdGs (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg) attenuated severity of HCl/ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury, as evidenced by decreases in gastric lesion index scores, ulceration area, histopathologic abnormality, and neutrophil infiltration. These effects were comparable to those of omeprazole, a standard anti-gastric ulcer agent. HCl/ethanol-induced gastric erosions was associated with tremendous increases in lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide, and pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators (myeloperoxidase, interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and cyclooxygenase-2), and with significant decreases in enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant activities. However, PdGs ameliorated gastric inflammation and oxidative stress by downregulating nuclear factor kappa B and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and upregulating heme oxygenase-1 expression. PdGs prevented gastric mucosal apoptosis by downregulating Bax and caspase-3 expression and upregulating Bcl-2 expression, thereby increasing prostaglandin E2 production. Our results suggested that PdGs exerted gastroprotective effects by decreasing the levels of inflammatory mediators, apoptotic markers, and antioxidants.

Tamoxifen and bone morphogenic protein-7 modulate fibrosis and inflammation in the peritoneal fibrosis model developed in uremic rats.||||||||Peritoneal fibrosis (PF) represents a long-term complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD), affecting peritoneal membrane (PM) integrity and function. Understanding the mechanisms underlying PF development in an uremic environment aiming alternative therapeutic strategies for treating this process is of great interest. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of tamoxifen (TAM) and recombinant BMP7 (rBMP7) in an experimental model of PF developed in uremic rats.||||To mimic the clinical situation of patients on long-term PD, a combo model, characterized by the combination of PF and CKD with severe uremia, was developed in Wistar rats. PF was induced by intraperitoneal (IP) injections of chlorhexidine gluconate (CG), and CKD was induced by an adenine-rich diet. Uremia was confirmed by severe hypertension, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN> 120 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (> 2 mg/dL). Uremic rats with PF were treated with TAM (10 mg/Kg by gavage) or BMP7 (30 μg/Kg, IP). Animals were followed up for 30 days.||||CG administration in uremic rats induced a striking increase in PM thickness, neoangiogenesis, demonstrated by increased capillary density, and failure of ultrafiltration capacity. These morphological and functional changes were blocked by TAM or rBMP7 treatment. In parallel, TAM and rBMP7 significantly ameliorated the PM fibrotic response by reducing α-SMA, extracellular matrix proteins and TGF-ß expression. TAM or rBMP7 administration significantly inhibited peritoneal Smad3 expression in uremic rats with PF, prevented Smad3 phosphorylation, and induced a remarkable up-regulation of Smad7, an intracellular inhibitor of TGFβ/Smad signaling, contributing to a negative modulation of profibrotic genes. Both treatments were also effective in reducing local inflammation, possibly by upregulating IκB-α expression in the PM of uremic rats with PF. In vitro experiments using primary peritoneal fibroblasts activated by TGF-ß confirmed the capacity of TAM or rBMP7 in blocking inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1ß expression.||||In conclusion, these findings indicate important roles of TGF-ß/Smad signaling in PF aggravated by uremia, providing data regarding potential therapeutic approaches with TAM or rBMP7 to block this process.

It remains unclear how TMEM16A overexpression plays a role in carcinogenesis in breast cancer. In this study, we found that high TMEM16A expression in combination with high EGFR or STAT3 expression was significantly associated with shorter overall survival in ER-positive breast cancer patients without tamoxifen treatment, and longer overall survival in patients with tamoxifen treatment. EGFR/STAT3 signaling activation by EGF promoted TMEM16A expression, and TMEM16A overexpression activated EGFR/STAT3 signaling in breast cancer cells. Both in vitro and in animal studies showed that TMEM16A overexpression promoted, and TMEM16A knockdown inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. In addition, TMEM16A overexpression-induced cell proliferation was blocked by EGFR/STAT3 inhibitors, and TMEM16A knockdown reduced EGF-induced proliferation and tumorigenesis in breast cancer. Furthermore, inhibition of TMEM16A channel function effectively reduced breast cancer cell proliferation, especially in combination with EGFR inhibitors. Our findings identify a mutual activation loop between TMEM16A and EGFR/STAT3 signaling, which is important for breast cancer proliferation and growth. TMEM16A inhibition may represent a novel therapy for EGFR-expressing breast cancer.

Assessment of Long-term Distant Recurrence-Free Survival Associated With Tamoxifen Therapy in Postmenopausal Patients With Luminal A or Luminal B Breast Cancer.||||||||Patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer have a long-term risk for fatal disease. However, the tumor biological factors that influence the long-term risk and the benefit associated with endocrine therapy are not well understood.||||To compare the long-term survival from tamoxifen therapy for patients with luminal A or luminal B tumor subtype.||||Secondary analysis of patients from the Stockholm Tamoxifen (STO-3) trial conducted from 1976 to 1990, which randomized postmenopausal patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer to receive adjuvant tamoxifen or no endocrine therapy. Tumor tissue sections were assessed in 2014 using immunohistochemistry and Agilent microarrays. Only patients with luminal A or B subtype tumors were evaluated. Complete long-term follow-up data up to the end of the STO-3 trial on December 31, 2012, were obtained from the Swedish National registers. Data analysis for the secondary analysis was conducted in 2017 and 2018.||||Patients were randomized to receive at least 2 years of tamoxifen therapy or no endocrine therapy; patients without recurrence who reconsented were further randomized to 3 additional years of tamoxifen therapy or no endocrine therapy.||||Distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI) by luminal A and luminal B subtype and trial arm was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analyses and time-dependent flexible parametric models to estimate time-varying hazard ratios (HRs) that were adjusted for patient and tumor characteristics.||||In the STO-3 treated trial arm, 183 patients had luminal A tumors and 64 patients had luminal B tumors. In the untreated arm, 153 patients had luminal A tumors and 62 had luminal B tumors. Age at diagnosis ranged from 45 to 73 years. A statistically significant difference in DRFI by trial arm was observed (log rank, P < .001 [luminal A subtype, n = 336], P = .04 [luminal B subtype, n = 126]): the 25-year DRFI for luminal A vs luminal B subtypes was 87% (95% CI, 82%-93%) vs 67% (95% CI, 56%-82%) for treated patients, and 70% (95 % CI, 62%-79%) vs 54% (95% CI, 42%-70%) for untreated patients, respectively. Patients with luminal A tumors significantly benefited from tamoxifen therapy for 15 years after diagnosis (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.35-0.94), and those with luminal B tumors benefited from tamoxifen therapy for 5 years (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.24-0.59).||||Patients with luminal A subtype tumors had a long-term risk of distant metastatic disease, which was reduced by tamoxifen treatment, whereas patients with luminal B tumors had an early risk of distant metastatic disease, and tamoxifen benefit attenuated over time.

Combinatorial screening of a panel of FDA-approved drugs identifies several candidates with anti-Ebola activities.||||||||Ebola virus (EBOV), pathogen of Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF), is an enveloped filamental RNA virus. Recently, the EHF crisis occurred in the Democratic Republic of the Congo again highlights the urgency for its clinical treatments. However, no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutics are currently available. Drug repurposing screening is a time- and cost-effective approach for identifying anti-EBOV therapeutics. Here, by combinatorial screening using pseudovirion and minigenome replicon systems we have identified several FDA-approved drugs with significant anti-EBOV activities. These potential candidates include azithromycin, clomiphene, chloroquine, digitoxin, epigallocatechin-gallate, fluvastatin, tetrandrine and tamoxifen. Mechanistic studies revealed that fluvastatin inhibited EBOV pseudovirion entry by blocking the pathway of mevalonate biosynthesis, while the inhibitory effect of azithromycin on EBOV maybe due to its intrinsic cationic amphiphilic structure altering the homeostasis of later endosomal vesicle similar as tamoxifen. Moreover, based on structure and pathway analyses, the anti-EBOV activity has been extended to other family members of statins, such as simvastatin, and multiple other cardiac glycoside drugs, some of which exhibited even stronger activities. More importantly, in searching for drug interaction, we found various synergy between several anti-EBOV drug combinations, showing substantial and powerful synergistic against EBOV infection. In conclusion, our work illustrates a successful and productive approach to identify new mechanisms and targets for treating EBOV infection by combinatorial screening of FDA-approved drugs.

Clinical and biological impact of miR-18a expression in breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.||||||||The analysis of breast cancer residual tumors after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCT) may be useful for identifying new biomarkers. MicroRNAs are known to be involved in oncogenic pathways and treatment resistance of breast cancer. Our aim was to determine the role of miR-18a, a member of the miR-17-92a cluster, in breast cancer behavior and outcome after nCT.||||Pre- and post-nCT tumor miR-18a expression was retrospectively assessed by qRT-PCR in 121 patients treated with nCT and was correlated with survival outcomes and with clinical and pathological characteristics. Breast cancer-derived MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were transfected with miR-18a and anti-miR-18a to evaluate the biological effects of this molecule. In addition, whole-transcriptome expression analysis was performed.||||High miR-18a expression in post-nCT residual tumors was found to be associated with a significantly worse overall survival [hazard ratio (HR): 2.80, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-7.76] and a strong trend towards a poorer disease-free survival (HR: 2.44, 95% CI: 0.99-5.02) compared to low miR-18a expressing post-nCT residual tumors. Clinical and experimental data were found to be in conformity with the proliferative effects of miR-18a, which showed a significant correlation with Ki67 and MYBL2 expression, both in pre- and post-nCT tumors and in public databases. In vitro analysis of the role of miR-18a in breast cancer-derived cell lines showed that a high expression of miR-18a was associated with a low expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), a decreased sensitivity to tamoxifen and an enrichment in luminal B and endocrine resistance gene expression signatures.||||From our data we conclude that post-nCT miR-18a expression in breast cancer serves as a negative prognostic marker, especially in luminal tumors. Clinical, in vitro and in silico data support the role of miR-18a in breast cancer cell proliferation and endocrine resistance and suggest its potential utility as a biomarker for additional adjuvant treatment in patients without a pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant therapy.

Evaluating the Anti-cancer Efficacy of a Synthetic Curcumin Analog on Human Melanoma Cells and Its Interaction with Standard Chemotherapeutics.|||||||| (turmeric) and has been shown to possess anti-cancer activity. However, due to its poor bioavailability and stability, natural curcumin is not an effective cancer treatment. We tested synthetic analogs of curcumin that are more stable. One of these derivatives, Compound A, has shown significant anti-cancer efficacy in colon, leukemia, and triple-negative inflammatory breast cancer cells. However, the effects of Compound A against melanoma cells have not been studied before. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrated the efficacy of Compound A for the selective induction of apoptosis in melanoma cells and its interaction with tamoxifen, taxol, and cisplatin. We found that Compound A induced apoptosis selectively in human melanoma cells by increasing oxidative stress. The anti-cancer activity of Compound A was enhanced when combined with tamoxifen and the combination treatment did not result in significant toxicity to noncancerous cells. Additionally, Compound A did not interact negatively with the anti-cancer activity of taxol and cisplatin. These results indicate that Compound A could be developed as a selective and effective melanoma treatment either alone or in combination with other non-toxic agents like tamoxifen.

Myeloid Cell-Derived HB-EGF Drives Tissue Recovery After Pancreatitis.||||||||Pancreatitis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and is a risk factor for pancreatic tumorigenesis. Upon tissue damage, an inflammatory response, made up largely of macrophages, provides multiple growth factors that promote repair. Here, we examine the molecular pathways initiated by macrophages to promote pancreas recovery from pancreatitis.|||| mice followed by tamoxifen treatment.||||Macrophages infiltrating the pancreas in experimental pancreatitis make high levels of HB-EGF. Both depletion of myeloid cells and ablation of myeloid cell HB-EGF delayed recovery from experimental pancreatitis, resulting from a decrease in cell proliferation and an increase in apoptosis. Mechanistically, ablation of myeloid cell HB-EGF impaired epithelial cell DNA repair, ultimately leading to cell death. Soluble HB-EGF induced EGFR nuclear translocation and methylation of histone H4, facilitating resolution of DNA damage in pancreatic acinar cells in vitro. Consistent with its role as the primary receptor of HB-EGF, in vivo ablation of EGFR from pancreatic epithelium during recovery from pancreatitis resulted in accumulation of DNA damage.||||By using novel conditional knockout mouse models, we determined that HB-EGF derived exclusively from myeloid cells induces epithelial cell proliferation and EGFR-dependent DNA repair, facilitating pancreas healing after injury.

The FBXW2-MSX2-SOX2 axis regulates stem cell property and drug resistance of cancer cells.||||||||SOX2 is a key transcription factor that plays critical roles in maintaining stem cell property and conferring drug resistance. However, the underlying mechanisms by which SOX2 level is precisely regulated remain elusive. Here we report that MLN4924, also known as pevonedistat, a small-molecule inhibitor of neddylation currently in phase II clinical trials, down-regulates SOX2 expression via causing accumulation of MSX2, a known transcription repressor of SOX2 expression. Mechanistic characterization revealed that MSX2 is a substrate of FBXW2 E3 ligase. FBXW2 binds to MSX2 and promotes MSX2 ubiquitylation and degradation. Likewise, FBXW2 overexpression shortens the protein half-life of MSX2, whereas FBXW2 knockdown extends it. We further identified hypoxia as a stress condition that induces VRK2 kinase to facilitate MSX2-FBXW2 binding and FBXW2-mediated MSX2 ubiquitylation and degradation, leading to SOX2 induction via derepression. Biologically, expression of FBXW2 or SOX2 promotes tumor sphere formation, which is blocked by MSX2 expression. By down-regulating SOX2 through inactivation of FBXW2 E3 ligase, MLN4924 sensitizes breast cancer cells to tamoxifen in both in vitro and in vivo cancer cell models. Thus, a negative cascade of the FBXW2-MSX2-SOX2 axis was established, which regulates stem cell property and drug resistance. Finally, an inverse correlation of expression was found between FBXW2 and MSX2 in lung and breast cancer tissues. Collectively, our study revealed an anticancer mechanism of MLN4924. By inactivating FBXW2, MLN4924 caused MSX2 accumulation to repress SOX2 expression, leading to suppression of stem cell property and sensitization of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen.

Cardiometabolic Effects of Endocrine Treatment of Estrogen Receptor-Positive Early Breast Cancer.||||||||Estrogen receptor-positive early breast cancer is common and has a relatively good prognosis. It shares risk factors with cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular disease is an important competing cause of mortality. Adjuvant endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitors (requiring concomitant ovarian suppression in premenopausal women) or selective estrogen receptor modulators (usually tamoxifen) exert oncologic benefits by respectively inhibiting estradiol synthesis or breast estrogen receptor signaling. Aromatase inhibitors cause systemic estradiol depletion. Tamoxifen has mixed agonistic/antagonistic effects in a tissue-dependent fashion. Given that estrogens modulate cardiometabolic risk, a review of the effects of endocrine therapy on cardiometabolic outcomes is pertinent. The current, but limited, evidence suggests that tamoxifen treatment, although associated with increases in body fat, hepatic steatosis, serum triglycerides, and diabetes risk, modestly reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) and may have favorable effects on markers of subclinical atherosclerosis. Tamoxifen is associated with either no effect on, or a reduction in, cardiovascular events, and it is associated with an increase in venous thromboembolic events. Aromatase inhibitors, although fewer studies are available and often confounded by comparison with tamoxifen, have not been consistently associated with adverse changes in cardiometabolic risk factors or increases in cardiovascular events. Further clinical trials designed to evaluate cardiometabolic outcomes are needed to more accurately determine the effects of endocrine therapy on cardiovascular risks, to inform individualized decisions regarding choice and duration of endocrine therapy, and to implement evidence-based strategies to mitigate cardiometabolic risks. In the meantime, although breast cancer-specific evidence for benefit of lifestyle measures is available and recommended routinely, proactive monitoring and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors should follow general population recommendations.

Regulation of estrogen signaling and breast cancer proliferation by an ubiquitin ligase TRIM56.||||||||Breast cancer ranks no. 1 in women cancer worldwide, while 60-70% are estrogen receptor alpha positive. The estrogen selective modulators, such as tamoxifen, become the effective drugs for controlling ER alpha breast cancer progression. However, tamoxifen resistance will develop during long-time treatment and cancer progression. Thus, further understanding of ER alpha signaling becomes necessary for the improvement of breast cancer therapy. Here, we identify TRIM56 as a novel regulatory factor in ER alpha signaling. TRIM56 expression is positively correlated with ER alpha and PR in breast cancer samples and is related to poor prognosis in endocrine therapy patients. TRIM56 depletion significantly decreases ER alpha signaling activity and ER-alpha-positive breast cancer proliferation in vitro and in vivo. TRIM56 associates with AF1 domain of ER alpha via its WD40 domain in the cytoplasm. TRIM56 prolongs ER alpha protein stability, possibly through targeting ER alpha K63-linked ubiquitination. In conclusion, our study reveals an interesting posttranslational mechanism between TRIM56 and ER alpha in breast cancer progression. Targeting TRIM56 could be a promising approach for ER-alpha-positive breast cancer.

Plasma endoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen levels in CYP2D6(C100T) carrying breast cancer patients and association with serum cholesterol.||||||||Breast cancer patients with high cholesterol biosynthesis signature had poorer therapeutic outcome. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 is crucial in the oxidation of tamoxifen to generate active metabolites, 4-hydroxytamoxifen and endoxifen. CYP2D6 variants with C100T substitution encode null or poor functional proteins. This study aims to examine the association of C100T genotypes and serum lipid levels with plasma drug levels in patients. Plasma tamoxifen concentration was positively associated with serum triglyceride concentration, adjusting for age and C100T genotype. Overweight (body mass index >24.0) patients with high serum cholesterol (≥200 mg/dL) had increased risks of ineffective endoxifen levels (<5.97 ng/mL). Compared to the low-cholesterol group, the high-cholesterol group had a lower 4-hydroxytamoxifen or endoxifen level in T/T carriers. In T/T carriers, the high-cholesterol group had an increased risk of an ineffective endoxifen level. Metastasis, hot flash/flushing, and high alanine transaminase did not relate to plasma 4-hydroxytamoxifen or endoxifen levels. Results indicate that C100T and high serum cholesterol are risk factors of ineffective endoxifen levels in Taiwanese breast cancer patients. These findings warrant further studies of a large hypercholesterolemic population to examine the outcome of increased doses of tamoxifen.

Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II protects against cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury.||||||||The chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) plays essential roles in organogenesis of embryos. Recently COUP-TFII is also implicated in several diseases in adults. Here we focus on the role of COUP-TFII in cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). COUP-TFII was the most abundantly expressed in the kidney among organs. Male tamoxifen-inducible COUP-TFII-knockout mice or control mice were intraperitoneally treated with 30 mg/kg body weight of cisplatin at 12 weeks old to induce AKI. The kidney samples were subject to morphological studies, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR. Serum levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were measured. Administration of cisplatin induced a more severe AKI in adult COUP-TFII-knockout mice. An increase in dead cells in both the proximal tubules and thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (TAL) was observed in the knockout mouse kidney. The expression levels of COUP-TFII decreased in the TAL by cisplatin administration. There was no difference in the expression levels of transporter mRNAs responsible for cellular cisplatin uptake between control and knockout mouse kidney. COUP-TFII-knockout mice and COUP-TFII-depleted cells exhibited an elevation in TNF-α levels, suggesting the involvement of the TNF-α pathway. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that COUP-TFII was enriched in the potential binding site, suggesting that COUP-TFII might directly suppress the TNF-α gene at transcriptional level. These results indicate the involvement of COUP-TFII in the pathophysiology of AKI and COUP-TFII may be a potential therapeutic target for AKI.

Immature O-glycans recognized by the macrophage glycoreceptor CLEC10A (MGL) are induced by 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen, oxidative stress and DNA-damage in breast cancer cells.||||||||Ligands of the C-type lectin CLEC10A such as Tn and sialyl-Tn representing early intermediates of O-glycosylation are hallmarks of many human malignancies. A variety of regulatory mechanisms underlying their expression are being discussed.||||CLEC10A ligands were detected in various tissues and cells using the recombinant glycan-binding domain of CLEC10A. In normal breast and endometrium, presence of ligands was correlated to the female cycle. Estrogen- and stress dependent induction of CLEC10A ligands was analyzed in MCF7 and T47D cells exposed to 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (Tam), zeocin and hydrogen peroxide. The expression and localization of CLEC10A ligands was analyzed by Western blot and immunofluorescence. In breast cancer patients CLEC10A ligand expression and survival was correlated by Kaplan-Meyer analysis.||||We observed binding of CLEC10A in normal endometrial and breast tissues during the late phase of the female hormonal cycle suggesting a suppressive effect of female sex hormones on CLEC10A ligand expression. Accordingly, CLEC10A ligands were induced in MCF7- and T47D breast cancer cells after Tam treatment and accumulated on the cell surface and in the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Phagocytosis experiments indicate that macrophages preferentially internalize CLEC10A ligands coated beads and Tam treated MCF7 cells. CLEC10A ligands were also expressed after the addition of zeocin and hydrogen-peroxide. Each substance induced the production of ROS indicating reactive oxygen species as a unifying mechanism of CLEC10A ligand induction. Mechanistically, increased expression of GalNAc-transferase 6 (GalNT6) and translocation of GalNT2 and GalNT6 from cis- towards trans-Golgi compartment was observed, while protein levels of COSMC and T-synthase remained unaffected. In breast cancer patients, positivity for CLEC10A staining in tumor tissues was associated with improved outcome and survival.||||CLEC10A ligands are inducible by hormone depletion, 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen and agents inducing DNA damage and oxidative stress. Our results indicate that CLEC10A acts as a receptor for damaged and dead cells and may play an important role in the uptake of cell debris by macrophages and dendritic cells.

Increased expression of the HDAC9 gene is associated with antiestrogen resistance of breast cancers.||||||||Estrogens play a pivotal role in breast cancer etiology, and endocrine therapy remains the main first line treatment for estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα)-positive breast cancer. ER are transcription factors whose activity is finely regulated by various regulatory complexes, including histone deacetylases (HDACs). Here, we investigated the role of HDAC9 in ERα signaling and response to antiestrogens in breast cancer cells. Various Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF7) breast cancer cell lines that overexpress class IIa HDAC9 or that are resistant to the partial antiestrogen 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (OHTam) were used to study phenotypic changes in response to ER ligands by using transcriptomic and gene set enrichment analyses. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed using public transcriptomic datasets from human breast cancer biopsies. In MCF7 breast cancer cells, HDAC9 decreased ERα mRNA and protein expression and inhibited its transcriptional activity. Conversely, HDAC9 mRNA was strongly overexpressed in OHTam-resistant MCF7 cells and in ERα-negative breast tumor cell lines. Moreover, HDAC9-overexpressing cells were less sensitive to OHTam antiproliferative effects compared with parental MCF7 cells. Several genes (including MUC1, SMC3 and S100P) were similarly deregulated in OHTam-resistant and in HDAC9-overexpressing MCF7 cells. Finally, HDAC9 expression was positively associated with genes upregulated in endocrine therapy-resistant breast cancers and high HDAC9 levels were associated with worse prognosis in patients treated with OHTam. These results demonstrate the complex interactions of class IIa HDAC9 with ERα signaling in breast cancer cells and its effect on the response to hormone therapy.

The Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) adherence measure was used to classify individuals as adherent (PDC≥80%) or non-adherent (PDC<80%). Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with adherence to hormonal therapy.||||Out of the 354 breast cancer respondents utilizing hormonal therapy, 194 (54.8%) were adherent and 160 (45.20%) were non-adherent. From 2011 through 2015, an increase in the usage of hormonal therapy was observed. Individuals having at least a high school diploma or General Equivalency Diploma (GED) had 2.795 (1.081, 6.941) times the odds of being adherent when compared to those who did not have a high school diploma or GED. Race, insurance status, marital status, poverty level, class of drug (aromatase inhibitor/tamoxifen), age, comorbidities, out-of-pocket costs and region were not significantly associated with adherence to hormonal therapy among breast cancer patients.||||This study found an association between an individual's level of education and adherence to hormonal therapy among breast cancer patients. These results can be used to help optimize allocation of resources to promote knowledge designed to increase the adherence of breast cancer patients to hormonal therapy.

Hormonal Therapy Resistance and Breast Cancer: Involvement of Adipocytes and Leptin.||||||||Obesity, a recognized risk factor for breast cancer in postmenopausal women, is associated with higher mortality rates regardless of menopausal status, which could in part be explained by therapeutic escape. Indeed, adipose microenvironment has been described to influence the efficiency of chemo- and hormonal therapies. Residual cancer stem cells could also have a key role in this process. To understand the mechanisms involved in the reduced efficacy of hormonal therapy on breast cancer cells in the presence of adipose secretome, human adipose stem cells (hMAD cell line) differentiated into mature adipocytes were co-cultured with mammary breast cancer cells and treated with hormonal therapies (tamoxifen, fulvestrant). Proliferation and apoptosis were measured (fluorescence test, impedancemetry, cytometry) and the gene expression profile was evaluated. Cancer stem cells were isolated from mammospheres made from MCF-7. The impact of chemo- and hormonal therapies and leptin was evaluated in this population. hMAD-differentiated mature adipocytes and their secretions were able to increase mammary cancer cell proliferation and to suppress the antiproliferative effect of tamoxifen, confirming previous data and validating our model. Apoptosis and cell cycle did not seem to be involved in this process. The evaluation of gene expression profiles suggested that STAT3 could be a possible target. On the contrary, leptin did not seem to be involved. The study of isolated cancer stem cells revealed that their proliferation was stimulated in the presence of anticancer therapies (tamoxifen, fulvestrant, doxorubicine) and leptin. Our study confirmed the role of adipocytes and their secretome, but above all, the role of communication between adipose and cancer cells in interfering with the efficiency of hormonal therapy. Among the pathophysiological mechanisms involved, leptin does not seem to interfere with the estrogenic pathway but seems to promote the proliferation of cancer stem cells.

Advances in Endocrine-Based Therapies for Estrogen Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer.||||||||Approximately 70% of breast cancers are estrogen-receptor positive. Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors have been the mainstay of endocrine therapy and have improved breast cancer survival. However, a large number of patients experience disease recurrence either during or following completion of endocrine therapy. Recent improvements in our understanding of the various mechanisms underlying the development of endocrine resistance have led to a dramatic change in the landscape of current endocrine treatment with the introduction of new drugs targeting molecular pathways involved in endocrine resistance. Over the past years we have witnessed the use of combination endocrine therapy with mammalian target of rapamycin antagonists, whilst most recently the introduction of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors has significantly improved response to endocrine therapy. Whilst not a formal systematic review, this article will provide historical background and summarise key clinical trials and current strategies in both first-line and second-line endocrine therapy.

We observed that oncogene activation induces a transitory increase of both FANCA and FANCD2 as well as FANCD2 monoubiquitination, readout of FANC pathway activation, followed by their degradation. FANCD2 depletion, which leads to a pre-senescent phenotype, anticipates OIS progression. Coherently, FANCD2 overexpression or inhibition of its proteosomal-dependent degradation slightly delays OIS progression. The pro-senescence protease cathepsin L, which activation is anticipated during OIS in FANCD2-depleted cells, also participates to FANCD2 degradation. Our results demonstrate that oncogene activation is first associated with FANCD2 induction and activation, which may support initial cell proliferation, followed by its degradation/downregulation when OIS proceeds.

The potential influence of breast cancer estrogen receptors' distribution on active DNA demethylation.||||||||Alterations in DNA methylation may cause disturbances in regulation of gene expression, including drug metabolism and distribution. Moreover, many cancers, including breast cancer, are characterized by DNA hypomethylation and a decreased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine level. The abnormal cell growth found in breast carcinoma might be the result of impaired up-regulation of breast cancer receptors. Receptors' expression in breast cancer determines clinical outcome, and it is possible that they lead to different DNA methylation patterns. Excessive steroid exposure can affect DNA methylation by promoting demethylation of CpG islands in promoter regions of genes, and hence may have an impact on promotion and progression of breast cancer cells. Tamoxifen, as a leading drug in breast cancer hormone therapy, has an ability to act like estrogen or antiestrogen depending on the type and localization of the breast cancer receptor. Further studies are needed to determine whether tamoxifen, similarly to steroids, may evoke changes in methylation pattern.

Icariin induces apoptosis by suppressing autophagy in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell line MCF-7/TAM.||||||||Icariin is a major component isolated from Epimedium brevicornum Maxim and has been reported to exhibit anti-tumor activity. However, whether icariin could reverse the acquired drug resistance in breast cancer remains largely unclear. Therefore, this study was designed to explore the antitumor effects of icariin and its underlying mechanisms in a tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell line MCF-7/TAM.||||3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay were performed to determine the effects of icariin on cell viability and cell death. Cell cycle progression and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry analysis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) assay was utilized to observe cell autophagy. The downstream protein levels were measured using western blotting.||||Here, we observed that icariin treatment not only inhibited the growth of MCF-7 but also has a potential function to overcome tamoxifen resistance in MCF-7/TAM. Moreover, icariin significantly induced cell cycle G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis, as well as suppressed autophagy. At molecular levels, icariin treatment remarkably down-regulated the expression levels of CDK2, CDK4, Cyclin D1, Bcl-2, LC3-1, LC3-II, AGT5, Beclin-1, but upregulated the expression levels of caspase-3, PARP and p62. Most importantly, we found inhibition of autophagy via 3-MA treatment could significantly enhance the effects of icariin on cell viability and apoptosis. Enhanced autophagy via autophagy related 5 (ATG5) overexpression could partially reverse the effects of icariin on cell viability and apoptosis.||||These results revealed that icariin might potentially be useful as an adjuvant agent in cancer chemotherapy to enhance the effect of tamoxifen through suppression of autophagy in vitro and provide insight into the therapeutic potential of icariin for the treatment of chemo-resistant breast cancer.

Expression of HIF-1α is related to a poor prognosis and tamoxifen resistance in contralateral breast cancer.||||||||Adjuvant endocrine treatment improves survival after estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer. Recurrences occur, and most patients with metastatic breast cancer develop treatment resistance and incurable disease. An influential factor in relation to endocrine treatment resistance is tumor hypoxia and the hypoxia inducible transcription factors (HIFs). Poor perfusion makes tumors hypoxic and induces the HIFs, which promote cell survival. We previously showed that hypoxic breast cancer cells are tamoxifen-resistant, and that HIF-inhibition restored tamoxifen-sensitivity. We found that HIF-induced tamoxifen-resistance involve cross-talk with epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), which itself is linked to tamoxifen resistance. Contralateral breast cancer (CBC), i.e. development of a second breast cancer in the contralateral breast despite adjuvant tamoxifen treatment is in essence a human in vivo-model for tamoxifen-resistance that we explore here to find molecular pathways of tamoxifen-resistance.||||We constructed a tissue-microarray including tumor-tissue from a large well-defined cohort of CBC-patients, a proportion of which got their second breast cancer despite ongoing adjuvant therapy. Using immunohistochemistry >500 patients were evaluable for HIF-1α and EGFR in both tumors, and correlations to treatment, patient outcome, prognostic and predictive factors were analyzed.||||We found an increased proportion of HIF-1α-positive tumors in tamoxifen-resistant (CBC during adjuvant tamoxifen) compared to naïve tumors (CBC without prior tamoxifen). Tumor HIF-1α-positivity correlated to increased breast cancer mortality, and negative prognostic factors including low age at diagnosis and ER-negativity. There was a covariance of HIF-1α- and EGFR-expression and also EGFR-expression correlated to poor prognosis.||||The increased percentage of HIF-1α-positive tumors formed during adjuvant tamoxifen suggests a role for HIF-1α in escaping tamoxifen's restraining effects on breast cancer.

Tamoxifen-induced vasculitis.||||||||Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used widely for the treatment of breast cancer. Apart from its common adverse reactions such as endometrial cancer, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, there are very few reports about its ability to cause vasculitis.||||A 45-year-old woman who underwent modified radical mastectomy was started on tamoxifen. Six months later, she developed vasculitis which was confirmed by immunofluorescence-induced vasculitis in a pre-menopausal woman.||||Dapsone was used to relieve her symptoms for two weeks, but the lesions reappeared when dapsone was stopped. She continues to suffer from vasculitis as tamoxifen could not be discontinued.||||This case report is important in order to draw attention towards this rare, but equally severe side effect of cutaneous vasculitis due to the most commonly used drug for breast cancer. In view of the absence of alternative medications for pre-menopausal women, it is necessary to have a strict monitoring of its adverse effects as well as more intensive research for a better agent.

Mitochondrial fragmentation, elevated mitochondrial superoxide and respiratory supercomplexes disassembly is connected with the tamoxifen-resistant phenotype of breast cancer cells.||||||||Tamoxifen resistance remains a clinical obstacle in the treatment of hormone sensitive breast cancer. It has been reported that tamoxifen is able to target respiratory complex I within mitochondria. Therefore, we established two tamoxifen-resistant cell lines, MCF7 Tam5R and T47D Tam5R resistant to 5 μM tamoxifen and investigated whether tamoxifen-resistant cells exhibit mitochondrial changes which could help them survive the treatment. The function of mitochondria in this experimental model was evaluated in detail by studying i) the composition and activity of mitochondrial respiratory complexes; ii) respiration and glycolytic status; iii) mitochondrial distribution, dynamics and reactive oxygen species production. We show that Tam5R cells exhibit a significant decrease in mitochondrial respiration, low abundance of assembled mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes, a more fragmented mitochondrial network connected with DRP1 Ser637 phosphorylation, higher glycolysis and sensitivity to 2-deoxyglucose. Tam5R cells also produce significantly higher levels of mitochondrial superoxide but at the same time increase their antioxidant defense (CAT, SOD2) through upregulation of SIRT3 and show phosphorylation of AMPK at Ser 485/491. Importantly, MCF7 ρ0 cells lacking functional mitochondria exhibit a markedly higher resistance to tamoxifen, supporting the role of mitochondria in tamoxifen resistance. We propose that reduced mitochondrial function and higher level of reactive oxygen species within mitochondria in concert with metabolic adaptations contribute to the phenotype of tamoxifen resistance.

Enhanced anti-mammary gland cancer activities of tamoxifen-loaded erythropoietin-coated drug delivery system.||||||||Nanomedicine is an emerging area in the medical field, particularly in the treatment of cancers. Nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) was shown to be a good nanoparticulated carrier for the delivery of tamoxifen (TAM). In this study, the tamoxifen-loaded erythropoietin-coated nanostructured lipid carriers (EPO-TAMNLC) were developed to enhance the anti-cancer properties and targetability of TAM, using EPO as the homing ligand for EPO receptors (EpoRs) on breast cancer tissue cells. Tamoxifen-loaded NLC (TAMNLC) was used for comparison. The LA7 cells and LA7 cell-induced rat mammary gland tumor were used as models in the study. Immunocytochemistry staining showed that LA7 cells express estrogen receptors (ERs) and EpoRs. EPO-TAMNLC and TAMNLC significantly (p<0.05) inhibited proliferation of LA7 in dose- and time-dependent manner. EPO-TAMNLC induced apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest of LA7 cells. Both drug delivery systems showed anti-mammary gland tumor properties. At an intravenous dose of 5 mg kg-1 body weight, EPO-TAMNLC and TAMNLC were not toxic to rats, suggesting that both are safe therapeutic compounds. In conclusion, EPO-TAMNLC is not only a unique drug delivery system because of the dual drug-loading feature, but also potentially highly specific in the targeting of breast cancer tissues positive for ERs and EpoRs. The incorporation of TAM into NLC with and without EPO coat had significantly (p<0.05) improved specificity and safety of the drug carriers in the treatment of mammary gland tumors.

Elevated Hexokinase II Expression Confers Acquired Resistance to 4-Hydroxytamoxifen in Breast Cancer Cells.||||||||Tamoxifen has been clinically used in treating estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer for over 30 years. The most challenging aspect associated with tamoxifen therapy is the development of resistance in initially responsive breast tumors. We applied a parallel-reaction monitoring (PRM)-based quantitative proteomic method to examine the differential expression of kinase proteins in MCF-7 and the isogenic tamoxifen-resistant (TamR) cells. We were able to quantify the relative protein expression levels of 315 kinases, among which hexokinase 2 (HK2) and mTOR were up-regulated in TamR MCF-7 cells. We also observed that the TamR MCF-7 cells exhibited elevated rate of glycolysis than the parental MCF-7 cells. In addition, we found that phosphorylation of S6K - a target of mTOR - was much lower in TamR MCF-7 cells, and this phosphorylation level could be restored upon genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of HK2. Reciprocally, the level of S6K phosphorylation was diminished upon overexpression of HK2 in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, we observed that HK2 interacts with mTOR, and this interaction inhibits mTOR activity. Lower mTOR activity led to augmented autophagy, which conferred resistance of MCF-7 cells toward tamoxifen. Together, our study demonstrates that elevated expression of HK2 promotes autophagy through inhibiting the mTOR-S6K signaling pathway and results in resistance of MCF-7 breast cancer cells toward tamoxifen; thus, our results uncovered, for the first time, HK2 as a potential therapeutic target for overcoming tamoxifen resistance.

The long noncoding RNA H19 promotes tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer via autophagy.||||||||Tamoxifen resistance remains a clinical challenge for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Recently, dysregulations in autophagy have been suggested as a potential mechanism for tamoxifen resistance. Although the long noncoding RNA H19 is involved in various stages of tumorigenesis, its role in tamoxifen resistance remains unknown. Here, we assessed the role of H19 in the development of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.||||Quantitative real-time PCR analyzed expression of H19 in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer tissues. Knockdown of H19 was used to assess the sensitivity to tamoxifen in vitro and in vivo. Both knockdown and overexpression of H19 were used to analyze the status of autophagy. Real-time quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, chromatin immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and Western blot were used to explore the tamoxifen resistance mechanism of H19.||||In this study, we observed that the expression of H19 was substantially upregulated in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell line and tumor tissues, and knockdown of H19 enhanced the sensitivity to tamoxifen both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, knockdown of H19 significantly inhibited autophagy in MCF7 tamoxifen-resistant (MCF7/TAMR) cells. Conversely, overexpression of H19 promoted autophagy. Interestingly, overexpression of H19 in MCF7 tamoxifen-sensitive cells could recapitulate tamoxifen resistance. Moreover, an increase in methylation in the promoter region of Beclin1 was observed in MCF7/TAMR-shH19 cells.

Tamoxifen inhibits cell proliferation by impaired glucose metabolism in gallbladder cancer.||||||||Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the leading malignancy of biliary system showing refractory chemoresistance to current first-line drugs. Growing epidemiological evidences have established that the incidence of GBC exhibits significant gender predominance with females two-threefold higher than males, suggesting oestrogen/oestrogen receptors (ERs) signalling might be a critical driver of tumorigenesis in gallbladder. This study aims to evaluate the antitumour activity of tamoxifen (TAM), a major agent of hormonal therapy for breast cancer, in preclinical GBC model. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to investigate mRNA levels. Protein expression was measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Glycolytic levels were measured by glucose consumption and lactic acid measurement. The antitumour activity of TAM alone or with cisplatin was examined with CCK8 assay, colony formation, flow cytometry and in vivo models. The results revealed that ERɑ expression was higher in GBC tissues and predicted poor clinical outcomes. TAM was showed effective against a variety of GBC cell lines. Mechanical investigations revealed that TAM enabled potent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by reduced nuclear factor Nrf2 expression and its target genes, leading to the activation of AMPK, which subsequently induced impaired glycolysis and survival advantages. Notably, TAM was demonstrated to sensitize GBC cells to cisplatin (CDDP) both in vitro and in vivo. In agreement with these findings, elimination of oestrogens by ovariectomy in nude mice prevented CDDP resistance. In summary, these results provide basis for TAM treatment for GBC and shed novel light on the potential application of endocrine therapy for patients with GBC.

The long noncoding RNA H19 promotes tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer via autophagy.||||||||Tamoxifen resistance remains a clinical challenge for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Recently, dysregulations in autophagy have been suggested as a potential mechanism for tamoxifen resistance. Although the long noncoding RNA H19 is involved in various stages of tumorigenesis, its role in tamoxifen resistance remains unknown. Here, we assessed the role of H19 in the development of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.||||Quantitative real-time PCR analyzed expression of H19 in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer tissues. Knockdown of H19 was used to assess the sensitivity to tamoxifen in vitro and in vivo. Both knockdown and overexpression of H19 were used to analyze the status of autophagy. Real-time quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, chromatin immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and Western blot were used to explore the tamoxifen resistance mechanism of H19.||||In this study, we observed that the expression of H19 was substantially upregulated in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell line and tumor tissues, and knockdown of H19 enhanced the sensitivity to tamoxifen both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, knockdown of H19 significantly inhibited autophagy in MCF7 tamoxifen-resistant (MCF7/TAMR) cells. Conversely, overexpression of H19 promoted autophagy. Interestingly, overexpression of H19 in MCF7 tamoxifen-sensitive cells could recapitulate tamoxifen resistance. Moreover, an increase in methylation in the promoter region of Beclin1 was observed in MCF7/TAMR-shH19 cells. In the double knockdown groups, both shH19+shSAHH and shH19+shDNMT3B rescued the Beclin1 promoter region methylation levels and reactivated autophagy functions. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay further validated that DNMT3B binds to the Beclin1 promoter region and the knockdown of H19 increases this binding.||||Our findings demonstrate that H19 induces autophagy activation via the H19/SAHH/DNMT3B axis, which could contribute to tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.

Cardiometabolic Effects of Endocrine Treatment of Estrogen Receptor-Positive Early Breast Cancer.||||||||Estrogen receptor-positive early breast cancer is common and has a relatively good prognosis. It shares risk factors with cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular disease is an important competing cause of mortality. Adjuvant endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitors (requiring concomitant ovarian suppression in premenopausal women) or selective estrogen receptor modulators (usually tamoxifen) exert oncologic benefits by respectively inhibiting estradiol synthesis or breast estrogen receptor signaling. Aromatase inhibitors cause systemic estradiol depletion. Tamoxifen has mixed agonistic/antagonistic effects in a tissue-dependent fashion. Given that estrogens modulate cardiometabolic risk, a review of the effects of endocrine therapy on cardiometabolic outcomes is pertinent. The current, but limited, evidence suggests that tamoxifen treatment, although associated with increases in body fat, hepatic steatosis, serum triglycerides, and diabetes risk, modestly reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) and may have favorable effects on markers of subclinical atherosclerosis. Tamoxifen is associated with either no effect on, or a reduction in, cardiovascular events, and it is associated with an increase in venous thromboembolic events. Aromatase inhibitors, although fewer studies are available and often confounded by comparison with tamoxifen, have not been consistently associated with adverse changes in cardiometabolic risk factors or increases in cardiovascular events. Further clinical trials designed to evaluate cardiometabolic outcomes are needed to more accurately determine the effects of endocrine therapy on cardiovascular risks, to inform individualized decisions regarding choice and duration of endocrine therapy, and to implement evidence-based strategies to mitigate cardiometabolic risks. In the meantime, although breast cancer-specific evidence for benefit of lifestyle measures is available and recommended routinely, proactive monitoring and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors should follow general population recommendations.

We recently showed that fibronectin (FN) leads to Tam resistance and selection of breast cancer stem cells. With the aim of developing a nanoformulation that would simultaneously tackle ER and FN/β1 integrin interactions, we designed polyethylene glycol-polycaprolactone polymersomes polymersomes (PS) that carry Tam and are functionalized with the tumor-penetrating iRGD peptide (iRGD-PS-Tam).||||Polyethylene glycol-polycaprolactone PS were assembled and loaded with Tam using the hydration film method. The loading of encapsulated Tam, measured by UPLC, was 2.4 ± 0.5 mol Tam/mol polymer. Physicochemical characterization of the PS demonstrated that iRGD functionalization had no effect on morphology, and a minimal effect on the PS size and polydispersity (176 nm and Pdi 0.37 for iRGD-TAM-PS and 171 nm and Pdi 0.36 for TAM-PS). iRGD-PS-Tam were taken up by ER+ breast carcinoma cells in 2D-culture and exhibited increased penetration of 3D-spheroids. Treatment with iRGD-PS-Tam inhibited proliferation and sensitized cells cultured on FN to Tam. Mechanistically, treatment with iRGD-PS-Tam resulted in inhibition ER transcriptional activity as evaluated by a luciferase reporter assay. iRGD-PS-Tam reduced the number of cells with self-renewing capacity, a characteristic of breast cancer stem cells. In vivo, systemic iRGD-PS-Tam showed selective accumulation at the tumor site.||||Our study suggests iRGD-guided delivery of PS-Tam as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for the management of breast tumors that express high levels of FN. Future studies in pre-clinical in vivo models are warranted.

The Influences of Adherence to Tamoxifen and CYP2D6 Pharmacogenetics on Plasma Concentrations of the Active Metabolite (Z)-Endoxifen in Breast Cancer.||||||||Tamoxifen efficacy in breast cancer is suspected to depend on adherence and intact drug metabolism. We evaluated the role of adherence behavior and pharmacogenetics on the formation rate of (Z)-endoxifen. In 192 Brazilian patients, we assessed plasma levels of tamoxifen and its metabolites at 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment (liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry), adherence behavior (Morisky, Green, and Levine medication adherence scale), and cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and other pharmacogene polymorphisms (matrix-assisted laser-desorption-ionization time of flight) mass spectrometry, real-time polymerase chain reaction). Adherence explained 47% of the variability of tamoxifen plasma concentrations (P < 0.001). Although CYP2D6 alone explained 26.4%, the combination with adherence explained 40% of (Z)-endoxifen variability at 12 months (P < 0.001). The influence of low adherence to not achieving relevant (Z)-endoxifen levels was highest in patients with noncompromised CYP2D6 function (relative risk 3.65; 95% confidence interval 1.48-8.99). As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated that (Z)-endoxifen levels are influenced both by patient adherence to tamoxifen and CYP2D6, which is particularly relevant for patients with full CYP2D6 function.

Expression of HIF-1α is related to a poor prognosis and tamoxifen resistance in contralateral breast cancer.||||||||Adjuvant endocrine treatment improves survival after estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer. Recurrences occur, and most patients with metastatic breast cancer develop treatment resistance and incurable disease. An influential factor in relation to endocrine treatment resistance is tumor hypoxia and the hypoxia inducible transcription factors (HIFs). Poor perfusion makes tumors hypoxic and induces the HIFs, which promote cell survival. We previously showed that hypoxic breast cancer cells are tamoxifen-resistant, and that HIF-inhibition restored tamoxifen-sensitivity. We found that HIF-induced tamoxifen-resistance involve cross-talk with epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), which itself is linked to tamoxifen resistance. Contralateral breast cancer (CBC), i.e. development of a second breast cancer in the contralateral breast despite adjuvant tamoxifen treatment is in essence a human in vivo-model for tamoxifen-resistance that we explore here to find molecular pathways of tamoxifen-resistance.||||We constructed a tissue-microarray including tumor-tissue from a large well-defined cohort of CBC-patients, a proportion of which got their second breast cancer despite ongoing adjuvant therapy. Using immunohistochemistry >500 patients were evaluable for HIF-1α and EGFR in both tumors, and correlations to treatment, patient outcome, prognostic and predictive factors were analyzed.||||We found an increased proportion of HIF-1α-positive tumors in tamoxifen-resistant (CBC during adjuvant tamoxifen) compared to naïve tumors (CBC without prior tamoxifen). Tumor HIF-1α-positivity correlated to increased breast cancer mortality, and negative prognostic factors including low age at diagnosis and ER-negativity. There was a covariance of HIF-1α- and EGFR-expression and also EGFR-expression correlated to poor prognosis.||||The increased percentage of HIF-1α-positive tumors formed during adjuvant tamoxifen suggests a role for HIF-1α in escaping tamoxifen's restraining effects on breast cancer. Implicating a potential benefit of HIF-inhibitors in targeting breast cancers resistant to endocrine therapy.

Autoantibodies Specific to ERα are Involved in Tamoxifen Resistance in Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer.||||||||Tamoxifen resistance is a major hurdle in the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. The mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance are not fully understood although several underlying molecular events have been suggested. Recently, we identified autoantibodies reacting with membrane-associated ERα (anti-ERα Abs) in sera of breast cancer patients, able to promote tumor growth. Here, we investigated whether anti-ERα Abs purified from sera of ER-positive breast cancer patients could contribute to tamoxifen resistance. Anti-ERα Abs inhibited tamoxifen-mediated effects on cell cycle and proliferation in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, anti-ERα Abs hampered the tamoxifen-mediated reduction of tumor growth in SCID mice xenografted with breast tumor. Notably, simvastatin-mediated disaggregation of lipid rafts, where membrane-associated ERα is embedded, restored tamoxifen sensitivity, preventing anti-ERα Abs effects. In conclusion, detection of serum anti-ERα Abs may help predict tamoxifen resistance and concur to appropriately inform therapeutic decisions concerning hormone therapy in ER-positive breast cancer patients.

Tamoxifen and bone morphogenic protein-7 modulate fibrosis and inflammation in the peritoneal fibrosis model developed in uremic rats.||||||||Peritoneal fibrosis (PF) represents a long-term complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD), affecting peritoneal membrane (PM) integrity and function. Understanding the mechanisms underlying PF development in an uremic environment aiming alternative therapeutic strategies for treating this process is of great interest. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of tamoxifen (TAM) and recombinant BMP7 (rBMP7) in an experimental model of PF developed in uremic rats.||||To mimic the clinical situation of patients on long-term PD, a combo model, characterized by the combination of PF and CKD with severe uremia, was developed in Wistar rats. PF was induced by intraperitoneal (IP) injections of chlorhexidine gluconate (CG), and CKD was induced by an adenine-rich diet. Uremia was confirmed by severe hypertension, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN> 120 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (> 2 mg/dL). Uremic rats with PF were treated with TAM (10 mg/Kg by gavage) or BMP7 (30 μg/Kg, IP). Animals were followed up for 30 days.||||CG administration in uremic rats induced a striking increase in PM thickness, neoangiogenesis, demonstrated by increased capillary density, and failure of ultrafiltration capacity. These morphological and functional changes were blocked by TAM or rBMP7 treatment. In parallel, TAM and rBMP7 significantly ameliorated the PM fibrotic response by reducing α-SMA, extracellular matrix proteins and TGF-ß expression. TAM or rBMP7 administration significantly inhibited peritoneal Smad3 expression in uremic rats with PF, prevented Smad3 phosphorylation, and induced a remarkable up-regulation of Smad7, an intracellular inhibitor of TGFβ/Smad signaling, contributing to a negative modulation of profibrotic genes. Both treatments were also effective in reducing local inflammation, possibly by upregulating IκB-α expression in the PM of uremic rats with PF. In vitro experiments using primary peritoneal fibroblasts activated by TGF-ß confirmed the capacity of TAM or rBMP7 in blocking inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1ß expression.||||In conclusion, these findings indicate important roles of TGF-ß/Smad signaling in PF aggravated by uremia, providing data regarding potential therapeutic approaches with TAM or rBMP7 to block this process.

Mice treated with tamoxifen for 1 week and left untreated for an additional week before infection showed similar parasitaemia levels and signs of cerebral malaria as control untreated mice.||||Tamoxifen and its active metabolite, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, have significant activity against the human parasite P. falciparum in vitro and the rodent parasite P. berghei in vivo. This activity may be useful for prevention of malaria in patients taking this drug chronically, but also represents a major problem for scientists using the conditional mutagenic Cre/LoxP system in the setting of rodent malaria.

Hormonal Therapy Resistance and Breast Cancer: Involvement of Adipocytes and Leptin.||||||||Obesity, a recognized risk factor for breast cancer in postmenopausal women, is associated with higher mortality rates regardless of menopausal status, which could in part be explained by therapeutic escape. Indeed, adipose microenvironment has been described to influence the efficiency of chemo- and hormonal therapies. Residual cancer stem cells could also have a key role in this process. To understand the mechanisms involved in the reduced efficacy of hormonal therapy on breast cancer cells in the presence of adipose secretome, human adipose stem cells (hMAD cell line) differentiated into mature adipocytes were co-cultured with mammary breast cancer cells and treated with hormonal therapies (tamoxifen, fulvestrant). Proliferation and apoptosis were measured (fluorescence test, impedancemetry, cytometry) and the gene expression profile was evaluated. Cancer stem cells were isolated from mammospheres made from MCF-7. The impact of chemo- and hormonal therapies and leptin was evaluated in this population. hMAD-differentiated mature adipocytes and their secretions were able to increase mammary cancer cell proliferation and to suppress the antiproliferative effect of tamoxifen, confirming previous data and validating our model. Apoptosis and cell cycle did not seem to be involved in this process. The evaluation of gene expression profiles suggested that STAT3 could be a possible target. On the contrary, leptin did not seem to be involved. The study of isolated cancer stem cells revealed that their proliferation was stimulated in the presence of anticancer therapies (tamoxifen, fulvestrant, doxorubicine) and leptin. Our study confirmed the role of adipocytes and their secretome, but above all, the role of communication between adipose and cancer cells in interfering with the efficiency of hormonal therapy. Among the pathophysiological mechanisms involved, leptin does not seem to interfere with the estrogenic pathway but seems to promote the proliferation of cancer stem cells.

Herein, we report on a premenopausal patient with right-side breast carcinoma who received adjuvant tamoxifen therapy (20 mg/day) for 1.5 years and developed sudden visual loss. Fundal examination revealed an obstruction in the branch of the retinal vein. The diagnosis was confirmed by fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography. Thus, tamoxifen was switched to an aromatase inhibitor. Tamoxifen-induced ocular complications should be kept in mind when visual symptoms are seen in patients undergoing tamoxifen therapy.

Tamoxifen promotes white matter recovery and cognitive functions in male mice after chronic hypoperfusion.||||||||Cerebral white matter lesions (WMLs) induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion are one of the major components of stroke pathology and closely associated with cognitive impairment. However, the repair and related pathophysiology of white matter after brain injury remains relatively elusive and underexplored. Successful neuroregeneration is a method for the potential treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. A non-steroidal estrogen receptor modulator, Tamoxifen, is an effective inhibitor of cell-swelling-activated anion channels and can mimic neuroprotective effects of estrogen in experimental ischemic stroke. However, its remains unclear whether Tamoxifen has beneficial effects in the pathological process after WMLs. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of Tamoxifen on multiple elements of oligovascular niche of the male C57BL/6 mice brain after bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) - induced WMLs. Tamoxifen was injected intraperitoneally once daily from 1 day after BCAS until 1 day before sacrificed. Following chronic hypoperfusion, BCAS mice presented white matter demyelination, loss of axon-glia integrity, activated inflammatory response, and cognitive impairments. Tamoxifen treatment significantly facilitated functional restoration of working memory impairment in mice after white matter injury, thus indicating a translational potential for this estrogen receptor modulator given its clinical safety and applicability for WMLs, which lack of currently available treatments. Furthermore, Tamoxifen treatment reduced microglia activation and inflammatory response, favored microglial polarization toward to the M2 phenotype, enhanced oligodendrocyte precursor cells proliferation and differentiation, and promoted remyelination after chronic hypoperfusion. Together, our data indicate that Tamoxifen could alleviate white matter injury and play multiple targets protective effects following chronic hypoperfusion, which is a promising candidate for the therapeutic target for ischemic WMLs and other demyelination diseases associated cognitive impairment.

CHUK/IKK-α loss in lung epithelial cells enhances NSCLC growth associated with HIF up-regulation.||||||||Through the progressive accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations in cellular physiology, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) evolves in distinct steps involving mutually exclusive oncogenic mutations in K-Ras or EGFR along with inactivating mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor. Herein, we show two independent in vivo lung cancer models in which CHUK/IKK-α acts as a major NSCLC tumor suppressor. In a novel transgenic mouse strain, wherein IKKα ablation is induced by tamoxifen (Tmx) solely in alveolar type II (AT-II) lung epithelial cells, IKKα loss increases the number and size of lung adenomas in response to the chemical carcinogen urethane, whereas IKK-β instead acts as a tumor promoter in this same context. IKKα knockdown in three independent human NSCLC lines (independent of K-Ras or p53 status) enhances their growth as tumor xenografts in immune-compromised mice. Bioinformatics analysis of whole transcriptome profiling followed by quantitative protein and targeted gene expression validation experiments reveals that IKKα loss can result in the up-regulation of activated HIF-1-α protein to enhance NSCLC tumor growth under hypoxic conditions in vivo.

Retrospective Analysis of Outcomes of Patients with Relapsed, Refractory and Metastatic Sarcomas who have received Metronomic Chemotherapy.||||||||Paediatric soft tissue sarcoma treatments and outcomes have improved significantly in the last few decades. However, a significant number of patients still succumb to the disease. In low-middle income countries there are dual problems of advanced disease at presentation and financial burden leading to poor compliance to therapy. Hence, we designed a low-cost oral metronomic chemotherapy protocol for these patients and studied the responses and toxicities to therapy in a tertiary referral hospital.||||This is retrospective, single institutional, observational study. We retrospectively reviewed data of patients with relapsed, refractory or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS) [ Ewing Sarcoma (ES); Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) or other STS] who were treated with the metronomic protocol of oral Tamoxifen, Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide (TEC) during the period April 1998 to September 2013, at the Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel, Mumbai.

Among the 49 patients, 32 were diagnosed ES, 13 RMS and 4 other STS. For the whole cohort response rates (RR) were 59% and clinical benefit rate (CBR) was 79%. Patients in the study were grouped into the following subgroups. Systemic recurrent/relapsed disease (N=24), metastatic disease at presentation (N=15) and local disease (refractory/recurrent) (N=10). None of the patients required blood or platelet support or admission for supportive care. The PFS for the above groups were 16.8 months, 12.5 months and 126.68 months respectively. This compares favorably with other historical cohorts in a similar setting.||||This study provides a preliminary evidence efficacy and tolerability of metronomic chemotherapy in poor risk ES and RMS.

Inhibiting PAD2 enhances the anti-tumor effect of docetaxel in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells.||||||||Tamoxifen resistance presents a huge clinical challenge for breast cancer patients. An understanding of the mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance can guide development of efficient therapies to prevent drug resistance.||||We first tested whether peptidylarginine deiminase 2 (PAD2) may be involved in tamoxifen-resistance in breast cancer cells. The effect of depleting or inhibiting PAD2 in tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 (MCF7/TamR) cells was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. We then investigated the potential of Cl-amidine, a PAD inhibitor, to be used in combination with tamoxifen or docetaxel, and further explored the mechanism of the synergistic and effective drug regimen of PADs inhibitor and docetaxel on tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells.||||We report that PAD2 is dramatically upregulated in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer. Depletion of PAD2 in MCF7/TamR cells facilitated the sensitivity of MCF7/TamR cells to tamoxifen. Moreover, miRNA-125b-5p negatively regulated PAD2 expression in MCF7/TamR cells, therefore overexpression of miR-125b-5p also increased the cell sensitivity to tamoxifen. Furthermore, inhibiting PAD2 with Cl-amidine not only partially restored the sensitivity of MCF7/TamR cells to tamoxifen, but also more efficiently enhanced the efficacy of docetaxel on MCF7/TamR cells with lower doses of Cl-amidine and docetaxel both in vivo and in vivo. We then showed that combination treatment with Cl-amidine and docetaxel enhanced p53 nuclear accumulation, which synergistically induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Meanwhile, p53 activation in the combination treatment also accelerated autophagy processes by synergistically decreasing the activation of Akt/mTOR signaling, thus enhancing the inhibition of proliferation.||||Our results suggest that PAD2 functions as an important new biomarker for tamoxifen-resistant breast cancers and that inhibiting PAD2 combined with docetaxel may offer a new approach to treatment of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancers.

We recently showed that fibronectin (FN) leads to Tam resistance and selection of breast cancer stem cells. With the aim of developing a nanoformulation that would simultaneously tackle ER and FN/β1 integrin interactions, we designed polyethylene glycol-polycaprolactone polymersomes polymersomes (PS) that carry Tam and are functionalized with the tumor-penetrating iRGD peptide (iRGD-PS-Tam).||||Polyethylene glycol-polycaprolactone PS were assembled and loaded with Tam using the hydration film method. The loading of encapsulated Tam, measured by UPLC, was 2.4 ± 0.5 mol Tam/mol polymer. Physicochemical characterization of the PS demonstrated that iRGD functionalization had no effect on morphology, and a minimal effect on the PS size and polydispersity (176 nm and Pdi 0.37 for iRGD-TAM-PS and 171 nm and Pdi 0.36 for TAM-PS). iRGD-PS-Tam were taken up by ER+ breast carcinoma cells in 2D-culture and exhibited increased penetration of 3D-spheroids. Treatment with iRGD-PS-Tam inhibited proliferation and sensitized cells cultured on FN to Tam. Mechanistically, treatment with iRGD-PS-Tam resulted in inhibition ER transcriptional activity as evaluated by a luciferase reporter assay. iRGD-PS-Tam reduced the number of cells with self-renewing capacity, a characteristic of breast cancer stem cells. In vivo, systemic iRGD-PS-Tam showed selective accumulation at the tumor site.||||Our study suggests iRGD-guided delivery of PS-Tam as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for the management of breast tumors that express high levels of FN. Future studies in pre-clinical in vivo models are warranted.

Circular RNAs in leukemia.||||||||In pace with the development of gene sequencing technology and transcriptome research, it has been found that 70 to 90% of the human genome is transcribed into RNAs, while only 2% of RNAs encode proteins. This implies that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) may exert vital biological functions and a full analysis of non-coding transcriptomes is needed. Over the past decade, the advance in high-throughput sequencing and transcriptome profiling has enabled the identification of circular RNAs (circRNAs) involved in many biological processes and the occurrence and development of diseases. Accumulating evidence has revealed that circRNAs may serve as new biomarkers for diagnosis as well as provide promising therapeutic approaches and novel drug screening strategies for leukemia. A comprehensive understanding of circRNAs in leukemia is a prerequisite for the development of clinical translational research. In this review, we will discuss the general information of circRNAs and focus on the current advances in understanding the association between dysregulated circRNAs and leukemia.

TRIM proteins in neuroblastoma.||||||||Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood. Outcome for children with high-risk NB remains unsatisfactory. Accumulating evidence suggests that tripartite motif (TRIM) family proteins express diversely in various human cancers and act as regulators of oncoproteins or tumor suppressor proteins. This review summarizes the TRIM proteins involving in NB and the underlying molecular mechanisms. We expect these new insights will provide important implications for the treatment of NB by targeting TRIM proteins.

S100 proteins in atherosclerosis.||||||||Atherosclerosis is an arterial disease associated with dyslipidemia, abnormal arterial calcification and oxidative stress. It has been shown that a continued chronic inflammatory state of the arterial wall contributes to the development of atherosclerosis. The inflammatory stimulation, recruitment of inflammatory cells and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines enhances vascular inflammation. Some members of the S100 proteins family bind with their receptors, such as advanced glycation end products (RAGE), scavenger receptors (CD36) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), contributing to the cellular response in atherosclerotic progression. This review summarizes the roles of S100 proteins (S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12) in the vascular inflammation, vascular calcification and vascular oxidative stress. S100 proteins are released from monocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells in response to cellular stress stimuli, and then the binding of S100 proteins to RAGE activate downstream signaling such as transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB) translocation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which act as a positive feedback loop for inducing pro-inflammatory phenotype in a wide variety of cell types including endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and leukocytes. Thus, it suggests that the inhibition of S100 proteins-mediated RAGE and TLR4 activation appears to be a promising approach to treat atherosclerosis. In addition, recent study showed that serum S100A12 can predict future cardiovascular events, highlighting that S100A12 is likely to be a potential biomarker of therapeutic efficacy and disease progression in coronary heart disease. Future studies of patients with coronary heart disease may provide more evidences supporting that S100 proteins is promising drug target in the prevention and therapy of atherosclerosis.

Although early detection provides the opportunity of controlling the primary tumor with effective therapies, metastatic activity is fatal. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as important modifiers of a plethora of biological mechanisms including those involved in cancer. They are classified into short and long ncRNAs according to their length. Deregulation of all these molecules has also been shown to play a critical role in Rb pathogenesis and progression. It is believed that ncRNAs can provide new insights into novel regulatory mechanisms associated with clinical pathological characteristics, facilitating the development of therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of Rb. In this review, we describe a variety of ncRNAs, which capable of regulating the most likely candidate genes involved in the tumorigenesis of Rb, could prove useful in analyzing different aspects of this cancer.

Long non-coding RNA in lung cancer.||||||||Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Owing to the difficulty in early diagnosis and the lack of effective treatment strategies, the 5-year survival rates for lung cancer remain very low. With the development of whole genome and transcriptome sequencing technology, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has attracted increasing attention. LncRNAs regulate gene expression at the epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels and are widely involved in a variety of diseases, including tumorigenesis. In lung cancer studies, multiple differentially expressed lncRNAs have been identified; several lncRNAs were identified as oncogenic lncRNAs with tumor-driving effects, while other lncRNAs play a role in tumor inhibition and are called tumor-suppressive lncRNAs. These tumor-suppressive lncRNAs are involved in multiple physiological processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis and thus participate in tumor progression. In this review, we discussed the oncogenic and tumor-suppressive lncRNAs in lung cancer, as well as their biological functions and regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, we found the potential significance of lncRNAs in clinical diagnosis and treatment.

Bioactive lipids in cancer stem cells.||||||||Tumours are known to be a heterogeneous group of cells, which is why they are difficult to eradicate. One possible cause for this is the existence of slow-cycling cancer stem cells (CSCs) endowed with stem cell-like properties of self-renewal, which are responsible for resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In recent years, the role of lipid metabolism has garnered increasing attention in cancer. Specifically, the key roles of enzymes such as stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase in CSCs, have gained particular interest. However, despite accumulating evidence on the role of proteins in controlling lipid metabolism, very little is known about the specific role played by lipid products in CSCs. This review highlights recent findings on the role of lipid metabolism in CSCs, focusing on the specific mechanism by which bioactive lipids regulate the fate of CSCs and their involvement in signal transduction pathways.

[Predictive biomarkers in bladder cancer].||||||||In the last few years, significant progress has been achieved in the therapeutic options for advanced urothelial bladder cancer.||||The aim of this work was to give an overview of the status and future perspective of the therapeutic options in this setting. Its focus is on the discussion of tissue-based therapy-predictive markers, which are evaluated through (molecular) pathology and thereby strengthening the role of pathology itself.||||Current (clinical study) data, the literature, and our own expertise were considered and summarized in the areas of therapy prediction of platinum-based chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and other therapeutic approaches.||||Molecular subtypes exhibit a predictive value both in platinum-based chemotherapy as well as in immunotherapy. However, further work is required to elucidate the predictive role of molecular subtypes in both settings. Changes in the DNA damage repair enzyme (DDR) genes, ERCC2, and ERBB2 as well as differences in the expression of EMMPRIN, survivin, and HMGA2 show promising results as further markers of chemotherapy efficacy. In the prediction of immunotherapy success, this mainly relates to the evaluation of the tumor mutation burden (TMB), tumor neoantigen burden (TNB), APOBEC signatures (MSig1; 3A/3B), and CD8-positive T‑effector cell signature. When using the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor erdafitinib, which has not yet been approved in Germany, the evaluation of specific FGFR mutations and/or gene fusions by a companion diagnostic test is mandatory in the USA.

The Roles of Circular RNAs in Osteosarcoma.||||||||Osteosarcoma is a malignant tumor that occurs most commonly in the metaphysis of the long bones in the limbs in children and adolescents. Even with surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the therapeutic effect has reached a peak with 60-70% survival rates. Therefore, new biological targets or molecular mechanisms that enhance the efficacy of osteosarcoma treatments are needed. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are useful biomarkers that have recently been recognized clinically and in medical research and have been of interest due to the use of next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. CircRNAs are involved in many diseases, including cancer. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the roles of circRNA in the diagnosis, progression, and prognosis of osteosarcoma.

Role of non-coding RNA in pancreatic cancer.||||||||Pancreatic cancer is a malignant disease that develops rapidly and carries a poor prognosis. Currently, surgery is the only radical treatment. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are protein-free RNAs produced by genome transcription; they play important roles in regulating gene expression, participating in epigenetic modification, cell proliferation, differentiation and reproduction. ncRNAs also play key roles in the development of cancer; microRNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) may lead the way to new treatments for pancreatic cancer. miRNAs are short-chain ncRNAs (19-24 nt) that inhibit the degradation of protein translation or their target gene mRNAs to regulate gene expression. lncRNAs contain >200 nt of ncRNA and play important regulatory roles in a number of malignant tumors, in terms of tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and distant metastasis. lncRNAs can be exploited for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer and have substantial prospects for clinical application. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of their regulation and function, as well as the significance of other ncRNAs, such as piwi-interacting RNA, in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer, are largely unknown. In this review, the structures of ncRNAs with various classifications, as well as the functions and important roles of ncRNAs in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer are reviewed.

Utilization of Biomarkers in Lupus Nephritis.||||||||Lupus nephritis (LN) occurs in up to 60% of SLE patients, and is a leading cause of disability and death. Current treatment of LN consists of a combination of high dose corticosteroids that non-specifically decrease inflammation and cytotoxic medications that reduce auto-antibody production. That combination of therapy is associated with significant side effects while remission rates remain inadequate. Since the introduction of biologics into the pharmacological armamentarium, there has been hope for less toxic and more effective therapies for LN. Unfortunately, after multiple clinical trials, no biologic has improved efficacy over standard of care therapies for LN. This is likely, in part, due to disease heterogeneity. The utilization of biomarkers in LN may provide a way to stratify patients and guide therapeutic options. In this review, we summarize traditional and novel LN biomarkers and discuss how they may be used to diagnose, stratify, and guide therapy in patients with LN, bringing precision medicine to the forefront of LN therapy.

Biomarkers in Pneumonia-Beyond Procalcitonin.||||||||Pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of mortality worldwide and one of the most common lower respiratory tract infections that is contributing significantly to the burden of antibiotic consumption. Due to the complexity of its pathophysiology, it is widely accepted that clinical diagnosis and prognosis are inadequate for the accurate assessment of the severity of the disease. The most challenging task for a physician is the risk stratification of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Herein, early diagnosis is essential in order to reduce hospitalization and mortality. Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein remain the most widely used biomarkers, while interleukin 6 has been of particular interest in the literature. However, none of them appear to be ideal, and the search for novel biomarkers that will most sufficiently predict the severity and treatment response in pneumonia has lately intensified. Although our insight has significantly increased over the last years, a translational approach with the application of genomics, metabolomics, microbiomics, and proteomics is required to better understand the disease. In this review, we discuss this rapidly evolving area and summarize the application of novel biomarkers that appear to be promising for the accurate diagnosis and risk stratification of pneumonia.

Emerging roles of non-coding RNAs in scoliosis.||||||||Scoliosis, a complex three-dimensional deformity of the spine with the Cobb angle (a measure of the spinal lateral curvature) >10 degree, encompasses a spectrum of pathologies, including congenital, idiopathic, syndromic and neuromuscular aetiologies. The pathogenesis is multifactorial involving both environmental and genetic factors but the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms of disease development remain largely unknown. Emerging evidence showed that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), namely microRNAs, long ncRNAs and circular RNAs, are deregulated in many orthopaedic diseases, including scoliosis. Importantly, these deregulated ncRNAs functionally participate in the initiation and progression of scoliosis. Here, we review recent progress in ncRNA research on scoliosis.

Angiopoietin-2: a biomarker in hyperthyroidism.||||||||Serum angiopoietin-2 level is elevated in several diseases suggesting its possible role as a mediator of angiogenesis and vascular network remodeling. Triiodothyronine and thyroxine have well documented effects on angiogenesis in vitro, but only few reports have studied angiopoietin-2 in thyroid-disease patients. The aim of the present study was to measure soluble angiopoietin-2 serum levels in a group of thyroid-disease patients with different levels of free triiodothyronine and thyroxine. Angiopoietin- 2 were quantified by ELISA in sera of fifteen healthy volunteers and forty-two thyroid ambulatory patients: nine with hyperthyroidism, four in therapy for hyperthyroidism, seven with subclinal hyperthyroidism, twelve with hypothyroidism, five with thyroiditis and five in therapy for thyroiditis. Median angiopoietin-2 level was significantly elevated in hyperthyroid patients (p < 0.01) and it was significantly increased vs all the other groups (p < 0.0001). In hyperthyroid patients anti thyroid therapy seems to reduce angiopoietin-2 level. A significant positive correlation was observed between Log angiopoietin-2 levels and serum concentration of Log free triiodothyronine (r = 0.4, P < 0.001) and Log free thyroxine (r = 0.4, P < 0.001) respectively. In conclusion, increased levels of angiopoietin-2 are present in hyperthyroid patients, and seems to correlate with free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine levels but not with anti-thyroid antibodies. These findings suggest angiopoietin-2 as a mediator of angiogenesis and vascular network remodeling in this disease, but further studies will be needed to determine the role of this biomarker in the pathophysiology and progression of hyperthyroidism.

Also, serum levels of S100A4, S100A8/S100A9, S100A12, and S100B correlate with insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes, metabolic risk score, and fat cell size. Yet, secreted S100B appears to exert neurotrophic effects on sympathetic fibers in brown adipose tissue contributing to the larger sympathetic innervation of this latter relative to white adipose tissue. In the present review we first briefly introduce S100 proteins and then critically examine their role(s) in adipose tissue and obesity.

SNW1 staining was considered weak in 31.5%, moderate in 37.7% and strong in 14% of cancers. Strong SNW1 expression was markedly more frequent in prostate cancers harboring the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion (24%) than in ERG negative cancers (7%, p < 0.0001). Significant associations with Gleason grade, stage, nodal status and early biochemical recurrence were observed in the ERG negative and positive subset.

CircularRNA as novel biomarkers in liver diseases.||||||||The liver is an essential organ that is primarily responsible for digestion and eliminating toxic substances from the body. After the industrial revolution, Western diet and lifestyle changes have increased the incidence of several liver diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD and NASH are mostly asymptomatic at early stages, and the disease progression from NAFLD to life-threatening HCC remains not fully understood. Circular RNA (CircRNA) is consist of a circular structure, and the circRNA-microRNA(miRNA)-mRNA axes have been shown to be involved in several cellular events, including apoptosis, vascularization, metastasis, etc. The highly stable structure of circRNAs has enabled themselves to be used as putative biomarkers of several diseases. Here we conducted a literature review and discussed the identified roles of circRNAs in NAFLD, NASH, liver cirrhosis, and HCC. For example, deficiency of circRNA_0046366 and circRNA_0046367 have been shown as the characteristics of NAFLD, and restoration of these circRNAs ameliorates the oxidative stress, lipotoxicity, and disease severity in NAFLD. Silencing of circ_0071410 was shown to alleviate hepatic stellate activation, the key step of liver cirrhosis. CDR1 and circ_0067934 can facilitate the invasion and metastasis of HCC, while circMTO1 negatively regulates the progression of HCC. Although several research works have been conducted, the whole picture of circRNA-related underlying mechanisms is unclear. Future works using high-throughput bioinformatic approaches will be needed to delineate the role of circRNAs in liver diseases and to further develop novel diagnostics and therapeutics.

Upregulation of C1-inhibitor in pancreatic cancer.||||||||The complement system has recently sparked more interest in cancer research. The classical pathway is initiated by activation of the C1 complex, which irreversibly can be bound to and inhibited by C1-INH. We have previously shown that C1-INH is upregulated in human glioblastoma (astrocytoma grade IV) on both gene and protein level. We here examine whether the complement system seems to play a role also in pancreatic cancer.||||We performed an expression analysis of complement associated genes in 36 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumors and matching normal pancreatic tissue samples from pancreatic cancer patients (data from the publicly available database GSE15471). C1-INH was significantly upregulated in the pancreatic cancer tissue. None of the downstream components of the cascade were significantly upregulated in the cancer samples as compared to the control samples, which is the same pattern as we found in glioblastoma. GO analysis showed that membrane attack complex came up as the second most significantly associated cellular component. Analyzing gene expression of C1-INH in the pancreatic cancer cell lines from primary tumors versus metastatic tumor revealed no difference for the two mRNA transcripts (GSE59357).||||Analysis of gene expression of complement related genes shows an upregulation of C1-INH and a downregulation of downstream components. This could suggest that C1-INH plays a role also in pancreatic cancer.

Expression and function of FRA1 protein in tumors.||||||||AP-1 is a dimeric complex that is composed of JUN, FOS, ATF and MAF protein families. FOS-related antigen 1 (FRA1) which encoded by FOSL1 gene, belongs to the FOS protein family, and mainly forms an AP-1 complex with the protein of the JUN family to exert an effect. Regulation of FRA1 occurs at levels of transcription and post-translational modification, and phosphorylation is the major post-translational modification. FRA1 is mainly regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling pathway and is degraded by ubiquitin-independent proteasomes. FRA1 can affect biological functions, such as tumor proliferation, differentiation, invasion and apoptosis. Studies have demonstrated that FRA1 is abnormally expressed in many tumors and plays a relevant role, but the specific condition varies from the target organs. FRA1 is overexpressed in breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, thyroid cancer and other tumors. However, the expression of FRA1 is decreased in cervical cancer, and the expression of FRA1 in ovarian cancer and oral squamous cell carcinoma is still controversial. In this review, we present a detailed description of the regulatory factors and functions of FRA1, also, the expression of FRA1 in various tumors and its function in relative tumor.

Role of circular RNA in hematological malignancies.||||||||Compared with linear RNA, circular RNAs (circRNAs) form a covalently closed circular continuous loop and are highly conserved, stable and tissue-specific. In recent years, circRNAs received considerable attention in the diagnosis, classification, treatment and prognosis of hematological tumors. circRNAs function as microRNA sponges and competitive endogenous RNAs that play an essential role in the translation, regulation and interaction of proteins. The present review discussed the fundamental properties and functions of circRNAs and the latest advancements in the context of circRNAs in the clinical research of hematological malignancies, namely acute and chronic myeloid leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. circRNAs show potential in the diagnosis and prognosis of various diseases and can be used as therapeutic targets and biomarkers for disease.

The emerging role of circular RNAs in breast cancer.||||||||Breast cancer (BCa) is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers and leading cause of cancer deaths among females worldwide. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a new class of endogenous regulatory RNAs characterized by circular shape resulting from covalently closed continuous loops that are capable of regulating gene expression at transcription or post-transcription levels. With the unique structures, circRNAs are resistant to exonuclease RNase R and maintain stability more easily than linear RNAs. Recently, an increasing number of circRNAs are discovered and reported to show different expression in BCa and these dysregulated circRNAs were correlated with patients' clinical characteristics and grade in the progression of BCa. CircRNAs participate in the bioprocesses of carcinogenesis of BCa, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, tumorigenesis, vascularization, cell invasion, migration as well as metastasis. Here we concentrated on biogenesis and function of circRNAs, summarized their implications in BCa and discussed their potential as diagnostic and therapeutic targets for BCa.

The protean world of non-coding RNAs in glioblastoma.||||||||Non-coding ribonucleic acids (ncRNAs) are a diverse group of RNA molecules that are mostly not translated into proteins following transcription. We review the role of ncRNAs in the pathobiology of glioblastoma (GBM), and their potential applications for GBM therapy. Significant advances in our understanding of the protean manifestations of ncRNAs have been made, allowing us to better decipher the molecular complexity of GBM. A large number of regulatory ncRNAs appear to have a greater influence on the molecular pathology of GBM than thought previously. Importantly, also, a range of therapeutic approaches are emerging whereby ncRNA-based systems may be used to molecularly target GBM. The most successful of these is RNA interference, and some of these strategies are being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials. However, a number of limitations exist in the clinical translation of ncRNA-based therapeutic systems, such as delivery mechanisms and cytotoxicity; concerted research endeavors are currently underway in an attempt to overcome these. Ongoing and future studies will determine the potential practical role for ncRNA-based therapeutic systems in the clinical management of GBM. These applications may be especially promising, given that current treatment options are limited and prognosis remains poor for this challenging malignancy.

MicroRNAs as Potential Biomarkers in Atherosclerosis.||||||||Atherosclerosis is a complex multifactorial disease that, despite advances in lifestyle management and drug therapy, remains to be the major cause of high morbidity and mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in industrialized countries. Therefore, there is a great need in reliable diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and effective treatment alternatives to reduce its burden. It was established that microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs), a class of non-coding single-stranded RNA molecules, can regulate the expression of genes at the post-transcriptional level and, accordingly, coordinate the cellular protein expression. Thus, they are involved not only in cell-specific physiological functions but also in the cellular and molecular mechanisms of human pathologies, including atherosclerosis. MiRNAs may be significant in the dysregulation that affects endothelial integrity, the function of vascular smooth muscle and inflammatory cells, and cellular cholesterol homeostasis that drives the initiation and growth of an atherosclerotic plaque. Besides, distinct expression patterns of several miRNAs are attributed to atherosclerotic and cardiovascular patients. In this article, the evidence indicating the multiple critical roles of miRNAs and their relevant molecular mechanisms related to atherosclerosis development and progression was reviewed. Moreover, the effects of miRNAs on atherosclerosis enabled to exploit them as novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets that may lead to better management of atherosclerosis and CVDs.

Opportunities of circulating tumor DNA in lung cancer.||||||||Current classification and treatment of lung cancer rely increasingly on molecular and genetic testing. Obtaining tumor tissue is not always feasible and multiple biopsies are undesirable. In response to the demand for non-invasive molecular and genetic testing in cancer care, several liquid biopsy technologies, including circulating DNA (ctDNA), have been developed. ctDNA analysis is now technically feasible to be carried out in large scales and integrated into clinical practice owing to the advances in technology. Despite the challenges in improving test accuracy and cost-effectiveness, there are huge potentials for ctDNA analysis in lung cancer management. This review focuses on the clinical utility of ctDNA analysis in lung cancer, including early detection, monitoring treatment response and detecting residual disease, identification of genetic determinants for targeted therapy, and predicting efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade.

The role of collagen in cancer: from bench to bedside.||||||||Collagen is the major component of the tumor microenvironment and participates in cancer fibrosis. Collagen biosynthesis can be regulated by cancer cells through mutated genes, transcription factors, signaling pathways and receptors; furthermore, collagen can influence tumor cell behavior through integrins, discoidin domain receptors, tyrosine kinase receptors, and some signaling pathways. Exosomes and microRNAs are closely associated with collagen in cancer. Hypoxia, which is common in collagen-rich conditions, intensifies cancer progression, and other substances in the extracellular matrix, such as fibronectin, hyaluronic acid, laminin, and matrix metalloproteinases, interact with collagen to influence cancer cell activity. Macrophages, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts play a role with collagen in cancer immunity and progression. Microscopic changes in collagen content within cancer cells and matrix cells and in other molecules ultimately contribute to the mutual feedback loop that influences prognosis, recurrence, and resistance in cancer. Nanoparticles, nanoplatforms, and nanoenzymes exhibit the expected gratifying properties. The pathophysiological functions of collagen in diverse cancers illustrate the dual roles of collagen and provide promising therapeutic options that can be readily translated from bench to bedside. The emerging understanding of the structural properties and functions of collagen in cancer will guide the development of new strategies for anticancer therapy.

Gastric cancer depends on aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 for fatty acid oxidation.||||||||The major source of ATP in cancer cells remains unclear. Here, we examined energy metabolism in gastric cancer cells and found increased fatty acid oxidation and increased expression of ALDH3A1. Metabolic analysis showed that lipid peroxidation by reactive oxygen species led to spontaneous production of 4-hydroxynonenal, which was converted to fatty acids with NADH production by ALDH3A1, resulting in further fatty acid oxidation. Inhibition of ALDH3A1 by knock down using siRNA of ALDH3A1 resulted in significantly reduced ATP production by cancer cells, leading to apoptosis. Oxidative phosphorylation by mitochondria in gastric cancer cells was driven by NADH supplied via fatty acid oxidation. Therefore, blockade of ALDH3A1 together with mitochondrial complex I using gossypol and phenformin led to significant therapeutic effects in a preclinical gastric cancer model.

Pending the development of specific inhibitors and tailored methods for identifying which specific metabolism is involved in the development of each tumor, ACLY could be targeted by inhibitors such as hydroxycitrate and bempedoic acid. The administration of citrate at high level mimics a strong inhibition of ACLY and could be tested to strengthen the effects of current therapies.

Olfactory receptor gene abundance in invasive breast carcinoma.||||||||Expression of olfactory receptors (ORs) has been reported in many human tissues outside the nasal epithelium. ORs have been validated as biomarkers in prostate cancer. In breast cancer, however, the expression and role of OR genes remain understudied. We examined the significance of OR transcript abundance in a large invasive breast carcinoma population and identified two OR genes, OR2W3 and OR2B6 to be potentially correlated to breast cancer progression. 960 breast invasive tumors and 56 human breast cancer cell lines were assessed for OR gene expression and 21 OR genes were highly abundant among 198 cases. Our transcriptome analysis discovered three significantly abundant OR genes among three sub-populations of invasive breast carcinoma patients. OR2W3 was correlated with invasion genes and basal-like subtype whereas OR2B6 was correlated with proliferation genes and luminal A subtype. Analyzing the OR gene upregulation among breast cancer cell lines showed that OR2B6 and OR2W3 were abundant similar to invasive breast tumors. Our study suggests that specific OR genes may be correlated with breast cancer characteristics, making ORs potential new diagnostic, and/or treatment markers. This study suggests future directions for the exploration of a role for ORs in the mechanisms of breast cancer proliferation and progression.

In previous chapters, we introduced related research techniques and methods for studying chimeric RNAs. Here, we present an overview of the landscape of chimeric RNAs in bladder cancer and verification of two fusion transcripts which are associated with bladder cancer. We used bioinformatics to analyze the TCGA bladder urothelial carcinoma RNA-sequencing dataset, which contains 414 bladder cancer samples and 19 matched normal samples. We identified 19,547 chimeric RNAs and applied multiple criteria to avoid false positives, reducing this list to 271 high-confidence chimeric RNAs, 13 of which specifically expressed in cancer. We validated 6 of these chimeric in clinical bladder cancer samples, including CHFR-GOLGA3, which was found to be expressed significantly higher in bladder cancer samples in comparison to matched normal samples. We have determined that this chimeric RNA is produced by cis-splicing between adjacent genes (cis-SAGe). Further, we found that CHFR-GOLGA3 is mainly expressed in the nucleus, suggesting that it may not encode chimeric protein and instead act as noncoding RNA. Our findings establish the chimeric landscape of bladder cancer and provide a research strategy for how to conduct chimeric RNA research in other tumors.

In muscle biopsies, out of nine tested, four transcripts showed an increased circular fraction: CDYL, HIPK3, RTN4_03, and ZNF609. Their circular fraction values correlated with skeletal muscle strength and with splicing biomarkers of disease severity, and displayed higher values in more severely affected patients. Moreover, Receiver-Operating-Characteristics curves of these four circRNAs discriminated DM1 patients from controls. The identified circRNAs were also detectable in peripheral-blood-mononuclear-cells (PBMCs) and the plasma of DM1 patients, but they were not regulated significantly. Finally, increased circular fractions of RTN4_03 and ZNF609 were also observed in differentiated myogenic cell lines derived from DM1 patients. In conclusion, this pilot study identified circRNA dysregulation in DM1 patients.

Biomarkers in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome.||||||||Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is a heterogenous process resulting in a severe acute lung injury. A single indicator does not exist for PARDS diagnosis. Rather, current diagnosis requires a combination of clinical and physiologic variables. Similarly, there is little ability to predict the path of disease, identify those at high risk of poor outcomes or target therapies specific to the underlying pathophysiology. Biomarkers, a measured indicator of a pathologic state or response to intervention, have been studied in PARDS due to their potential in diagnosis, prognostication and measurement of therapeutic response. Additionally, PARDS biomarkers show great promise in furthering our understanding of specific subgroups or endotypes in this highly variable disease, and thereby predict which patients may benefit and which may be harmed by PARDS specific therapies. In this chapter, we review the what, when, why and how of biomarkers in PARDS and discuss future directions in this quickly changing landscape.

Interactions among lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNA in colorectal cancer.||||||||Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are longer than 200 nts non-coding transcripts and have recently emerged as one of the largest and significantly diverse RNA families whereas microRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved short single-stranded ncRNAs (∼18-22 nucleotides). As families of small and long evolutionarily conserved ncRNAs, lncRNAs activate and repress genes via a variety of mechanisms at both transcriptional and translational levels, while miRNAs regulate protein-coding gene expression mainly through mRNA degradation or silencing, These ncRNAs have been proved to be involved in multiple biological functions, such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, angiogenesis and apoptosis. Today, while majority of studies have focused on defining the regulatory functions of lncRNAs and miRNAs, limited information have now available for the mutual regulations of lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNA. Thus, the underlying molecular mechanisms, in particularly the interactions among lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNA in development, growth, metastasis and therapeutic potential of cancer still remain obscure. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is known as the third most common and fourth leading cancer death worldwide. Increasing evidence showed the close correlations among aberrant expressions of lncRNAs, miRNAs and the occurrence, development of CRC. This review summarize the potential links among these RNAs in following three areas: 1, The biogenesis and roles of miRNAs in CRC; 2, The biogenesis and functions of lncRNAs in CRC; 3, The interactions among lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNA in tumorigensis, growth, progression, EMT formation, chemoradiotherapy resistance, and therapeutic potential in CRC. We believe that identifying diverging lncRNAs, miRNAs and relevant genes, their interactions and complex molecular regulatory networks will provide important clues for understanding the mechanism and developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for CRC. Further efforts are warranted to bring the promise of regulating their activities into clinical utilities.

Survivin a pivotal antiapoptotic protein in rheumatoid arthritis.||||||||Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease, pathologically characterized by lymphocyte infiltration of the synovial membrane that leads to chronic inflammation and progressive joint damage. RA develops as a result of increased cell infiltration and cell proliferation as well as impaired cell death. Activated cells in joints including lymphocytes and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) survive for a long time as a consequence of compromised apoptosis, but the mechanism underlying cell survival in synovium remains to be firmly established. Inhibition of apoptosis by survivin, as a critical antiapoptotic protein, contributes to both the persistence of autoreactive T lymphocytes and tumor-like phenotype of FLS in RA. In addition to the antiapoptotic role, survivin also has prognostic relevance in RA prodromal phase. Hence, this review provides an overview of the current knowledge regarding the involvement of survivin protein in the pathogenesis of RA.

Identification SYT13 as a novel biomarker in lung adenocarcinoma.||||||||Synaptotagmins are a class of proteins that play an important role in the secretion of neurotransmitters by synaptic vesicles. However, recent studies have shown that members of this family also have a certain function in the development of tumors. In this study, we first identified through The Cancer Genome Atlas data analyzed that a novel synaptotagmin, SYT13, was closely related to the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma, but was not significantly correlated with the prognosis of lung squamous cell carcinoma. Then we knocked down the expression of SYT13 gene in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines A549 and H1299, and successfully induced decreased proliferation and clonality of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, and observed cell cycle arrest and apoptosis enhancement in both cell lines. In addition, we detected the migration ability of SYT13 knockdown lung adenocarcinoma cell lines by the cell scratch test and the transwell test. Interestingly, there was a decreased migration ability of SYT13 knockdown in H1299 cells even though there was no significant difference in the migration of A549 cells. These results demonstrate that SYT13 plays an important role in the development of lung adenocarcinoma, which deepens our understanding of the mechanism of lung adenocarcinoma development and provides new possibilities for targeted therapy of lung adenocarcinoma.

Candidate microRNAs in Malaria Infection Biomarkers: A Systematic Review.||||||||Malaria continues to be a public health problem in tropical countries, causing 445.000/year deaths in 2017. Infected malaria parasite invasion and host immune system results in dysregulation of genes expressions during the transcription processes serve as microRNA. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs with 18-24 nucleotides in length, which regulate gene expression. The candidate's miRNAs would be used as potential biomarkers in the future and perspective. We aimed to do a systematic review on miRNAs serve as candidate clinical biomarkers in malaria infection. Electronic databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane data bases) were screened and articles were included per established selection criteria. We searched to identify publications all over the world related malaria and miRNA. PRISMA guidelines were followed, 262 articles were searched, duplicates and unconnected papers were removed and excluded. 19 articles were included in the studies. Upon infection with malaria parasite, infected liver or tissue affected by parasite sequestration may produce tissue-specific miRNAs that are released to the blood circulation. Immune system results in dysregulation of target genes serve be specific candidate miRNAs as biomarker in early malaria infection, severe malaria and cerebral malaria such as PfEMP-1, IFN-γ, AGO-1 AGO-2; IL4, CD80, CD86; CD36, ANG-1 and ANG-2, these candidate genes are associated with target candidate miRNAs such as miR-16, miR-155, miR-150, miR-451 and miR-223.

We performed a systematic literature review to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of VM status for overall survival of MM patients.||||The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool. Diagnostic capacity of VM variables, including sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and the area under summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC), were pooled using Meta-DiSc software.||||A retrospective observational study was conducted based on twelve clinical studies including 978 clinically confirmed melanoma patients with proportion (P). VM+ melanoma cells were associated with poor prognosis in 38% of MM group (P = 0.35, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.27-0.42, p < 0.001). The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.82 (95% CI: 0.79-0.84) and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.66-0.71), respectively. Furthermore, the pooled PLR, NLR, and DOR were 2.56 (95% CI: 1.94-3.93), 0.17 (95% CI: 0.07-0.42), and 17.75 (95% CI: 5.30-59.44), respectively. Furthermore, the AUC of SROC was 0.63, indicating high reliability of VM status as a biomarker. Importantly, subgroup results suggested that VM+ status is a significantly accurate prognostic biomarker when diagnosed by the CD31-/PAS+ staining methods in Asian MM samples (p < 0.001).||||Our findings support the potential of VM status of tumors as a promising prognostic biomarker and emphasize an effective adjuvant therapeutic strategy in the prognosis of Asian MM patients.

However, there is no confirmation in an independent validation study. The aim of this study was to summarize the prognostic value of miRNA-130 family (miRNA-130a and miRNA-130b) for survival in patients with cancer.||||The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate the association strength between miRNA-130 family expression and prognosis. Kaplan-Meier plotters were used to verify the miRNA-130b expression and overall survival (OS).||||A total of 2141 patients with OS and 1159 patients with disease-free survival (DFS)/progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed in evidence synthesis. For the miRNA-130a, the overall pooled effect size (HR) was HR 1.58 (95% CI: 1.21-2.06, P < 0.001). Tissue and serum expression of miRNA-130a was significantly associated with the OS (HR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.11-2.14, P = 0.009; HR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.14-2.38, P = 0.008), and in gastric cancer (HR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.34-2.45, P < 0.001). For the miRNA-13b, a statistical correlation was observed between high miRNA-130b expression and poor OS in patients with cancer (HR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.47-2.59, P < 0.001), especially in tissue sample (HR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.39-2.91, P < 0.001), Asian (HR = 2.55, 95% Cl: 1.77-3.69, P < 0.001) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.23-2.85, P = 0.004). The expression of miRNA-130b was significantly correlated with DFS/PFS (HR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.31-1.77, P < 0.001), in tissue (HR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.50-2.62, P < 0.001) and serum (HR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.15-1.64, P < 0.001), especially in HCC (HR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.50, 2.62, P < 0.001). In database test, a significant correlation between high miRNA-130b expression and poor OS for HCC patients was observed (HR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.01, 2.35, P = 0.0045).||||The high expression of miRNA-130 family might predict poor prognosis in cancer patients. Prospectively, combining miRNA-130a and miRNA-130b may be considered as powerful prognostic predictor for clinical application.

Identification and monitoring of somatic mutations in circulating cell-free tumor DNA in lung cancer patients.||||||||Circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) isolated from the peripheral blood of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients provides biomarkers for both therapeutic target selection, particularly when direct tumor biopsy is unfeasible, and also for drug resistance monitoring. This study evaluates the reliability and feasibility of ctDNA analysis in an in-house clinical molecular diagnostic workflow.||||Mutation profiling by both standard methods and Next-Generation sequencing (NGS) was carried out and compared on 2 independent lung cancer patient cohorts. Cohort 1 consisted of 50 EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients, established on tumour biopsy, for whom ctDNA was collected at disease progression after TKI-inhibitor treatment and could be used to monitor drug resistance. Cohort 2 consisted of 50 newly diagnosed lung cancer patients for whom tumour biopsy was not possible and only ctDNA was available, providing the possibility of biomarker identification.||||ctDNA analysis of Cohort 1 verified the persistence of the tumour-detected EGFR activating mutation at disease progression by both standard and NGS methods, in 84% and 92% of the cases respectively. The T790M EGFR resistance mutation was identified in 71% of the ctDNA EGFR mutated samples providing vital information for their disease management. In newly diagnosed Cohort 2 patients, EGFR activating mutations were detected in 16% of the patients by both standard and NGS analysis of ctDNA in peripheral blood, providing indication to targeted-therapy otherwise unavailable for this group of patients.||||The presented study investigated lung cancer ctDNA analysis, comparing conventional methods versus NGS sequencing, and demonstrated the successful use of plasma ctDNA as a template for targeted NGS tumor gene panel in an in-house routine clinical practice. More importantly, these data underline the advantages of the clinical application of ctDNA NGS analysis for identification of therapeutic targets, real-time monitoring of therapy, and resistance mechanisms in lung cancer patients.

Carcinoembryonic antigen is a sialyl Lewis x/a carrier and an E‑selectin ligand in non‑small cell lung cancer.||||||||The formation of distant metastasis resulting from vascular dissemination is one of the leading causes of mortality in non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This metastatic dissemination initiates with the adhesion of circulating cancer cells to the endothelium. The minimal requirement for the binding of leukocytes to endothelial E‑selectins and subsequent transmigration is the epitope of the fucosylated glycan, sialyl Lewis x (sLex), attached to specific cell surface glycoproteins. sLex and its isomer sialyl Lewis a (sLea) have been described in NSCLC, but their functional role in cancer cell adhesion to endothelium is still poorly understood. In this study, it was hypothesised that, similarly to leukocytes, sLe glycans play a role in NSCLC cell adhesion to E‑selectins. To assess this, paired tumour and normal lung tissue samples from 18 NSCLC patients were analyzed. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry assays demonstrated that tumour tissues exhibited significantly stronger reactivity with anti‑sLex/sLea antibody and E‑selectin chimera than normal tissues (2.2‑ and 1.8‑fold higher, respectively), as well as a higher immunoreactive score. High sLex/sLea expression was associated with bone metastasis. The overall α1,3‑fucosyltransferase (FUT) activity was increased in tumour tissues, along with the mRNA levels of FUT3, FUT6 and FUT7, whereas FUT4 mRNA expression was decreased. The expression of E‑selectin ligands exhibited a weak but significant correlation with the FUT3/FUT4 and FUT7/FUT4 ratios. Additionally, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was identified in only 8 of the 18 tumour tissues; CEA‑positive tissues exhibited significantly increased sLex/sLea expression. Tumour tissue areas expressing CEA also expressed sLex/sLea and showed reactivity to E‑selectin. Blot rolling assays further demonstrated that CEA immunoprecipitates exhibited sustained adhesive interactions with E‑selectin‑expressing cells, suggesting CEA acts as a functional protein scaffold for E‑selectin ligands in NSCLC. In conclusion, this work provides the first demonstration that sLex/sLea are increased in primary NSCLC due to increased α1,3‑FUT activity. sLex/sLea is carried by CEA and confers the ability for NSCLC cells to bind E‑selectins, and is potentially associated with bone metastasis. This study contributes to identifying potential future diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for lung cancer.

Stoichioproteomics reveal oxygen usage bias, key proteins and pathways in glioma.||||||||The five-year survival rate and therapeutic effect of malignant glioma is low. Identification of key/associated proteins and pathways in glioma is necessary for developing effective diagnosis and targeted therapy of glioma. In addition, Glioma involves hypoxia-specific microenvironment, whether hypoxia restriction influences the stoichioproteomic characteristics of expressed proteins is unknown.||||In this study, we analyzed the most comprehensive immunohistochemical data from 12 human glioma samples and 4 normal cell types of cerebral cortex, identified differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), and researched the oxygen contents of DEPs, highly and lowly expressed proteins. Further we located key genes on human genome to determine their locations and enriched them for key functional pathways.||||Our results showed that although no difference was detected on whole proteome, the average oxygen content of highly expressed proteins is 6.65% higher than that of lowly expressed proteins in glioma. A total of 1480 differentially expressed proteins were identified in glioma, including 226 up regulated proteins and 1254 down regulated proteins. The average oxygen content of up regulated proteins is 2.56% higher than that of down regulated proteins in glioma. The localization of differentially expressed genes on human genome showed that most genes were on chromosome 1 and least on Y. The up regulated proteins were significantly enriched in pathways including cell cycle, pathways in cancer, oocyte meiosis, DNA replication etc. Functional dissection of the up regulated proteins with high oxygen contents showed that 51.28% of the proteins were involved in cell cycle and cyclins.||||Element signature of oxygen limitation could not be detected in glioma, just as what happened in plants and microbes. Unsaved use of oxygen by the highly expressed proteins and DEPs were adapted to the fast division of glioma cells. This study can help to reveal the molecular mechanism of glioma, and provide a new approach for studies of cancer-related biomacromolecules. In addition, this study lays a foundation for application of stoichioproteomics in precision medicine.

Raised levels of Il-6, Il-17a, and Il-22 in fatal leptospirosis.||||||||Clinical manifestations of leptospirosis range from mild, common cold-like illness, to a life-threatening condition. The host immune response has been hypothesized to play a major role in leptospirosis outcome. Increased levels of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, may promote tissue damage that lead to increased disease severity. The question is whether cytokines levels may predict the outcome of leptospirosis and guide patient management. This study aimed to assess the association between Th1-, Th2-, and Th17-related cytokines with the clinical outcome of patients with leptospirosis. Different cytokine levels were measured in fifty-two plasma samples of hospitalized patients diagnosed with leptospirosis in Malaysia (January 2016-December 2017). Patients were divided into two separate categories: survived (n = 40) and fatal outcome (n = 12). Nineteen plasma samples from healthy individuals were obtained as controls. Cytokine quantification was performed using Simple Plex™ assays from ProteinSimple (San Jose, CA, USA). Measurements were done in triplicate and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad software and SPSS v20. IL-6 (p = 0.033), IL-17A (p = 0.022), and IL-22 (p = 0.046) were significantly elevated in fatal cases. IL-17A concentration (OR 1.115; 95% CI 1.010-1.231) appeared to be an independent predictor of fatality of leptospirosis. Significantly higher levels of TNF-α (p ≤ 0.0001), IL-6 (p ≤ 0.0001), IL-10 (p ≤ 0.0001), IL-12 (p ≤ 0.0001), IL17A (p ≤ 0.0001), and IL-18 (p ≤ 0.0001) were observed among leptospirosis patients in comparison with healthy controls. Our study shows that certain cytokine levels may serve as possible prognostic biomarkers in leptospirosis patients.

Retinal capillary skeleton density, retinal capillary perfusion density, and fractal dimension analysis of retinal capillary complexity were performed in the total annular zone and quadrant sectors. The thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer and inner plexiform layer, and total retinal thickness were extracted from retinal structural images. Relationships among the retinal capillaries, retinal structure, and clinical parameters were analyzed.||||The superficial retinal capillary plexus in Parkinson disease patients had lower retinal capillary skeleton and perfusion densities and capillary complexity in the total annular zone and all quadrant sectors compared with healthy control subjects. The deep retinal capillary plexus retinal capillary complexity was decreased in the total annular zone and the superior and inferior quadrants.

We found that ethanol and acetate induce formation of HD cells, and mitochondrial respiration is required. From their transcriptomes and metabolomes, we found up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HD cells involved in the RGT2/RGT1 glucose sensing pathway and its down-stream genes encoding hexose transporters. For HD cells, we determined an abundance of various carbon sources including glucose, lactate, pyruvate, trehalose, mannitol, mannose, and galactose. Other up-regulated DEGs in HD cells were involved in the TORC1-SCH9 signaling pathway and its down-stream genes involved in cytoplasmic translation. We also measured an abundance of free amino acids in HD cells including valine, proline, isoleucine, and glutamine. These characteristics of the HD cell transcriptome and metabolome may be important conditions for maintaining a long-living phenotype.

Transcriptomic Profiling Identifies a DNA Repair-Related Signature as a Novel Prognostic Marker in Lower Grade Gliomas.||||||||Gliomas are the most common and malignant intracranial tumors. The standard therapy is surgical resection combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, the emergence of radioresistance and chemoresistance, which is largely due to DNA damage repair, limits the therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, we identified a high-efficiency DNA damage repair-related risk signature as a predictor for prognosis in lower grade glioma.||||The signature was developed and validated in two independent datasets of the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (172 samples) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (451 samples). The time-dependent ROC curve, Cox regression, Nomogram, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to evaluate the prognostic performance of the risk signature. The Metascape and IHC staining were performed to reveal the potential biological mechanism. GraphPad prism, SPSS, and R language were used for statistical analysis and graphical work.||||This signature could distinguish the prognosis of patients, and patients with high-risk scores exhibited short survival time. The time-dependent ROC curve, Cox regression, and Nomogram model indicated the independent prognostic performance and high prognostic accuracy of the signature for survival. Combined with the IDH mutation status, this risk signature could further subdivide patients with distinct survival. Functional analysis of associated genes revealed signature-related biological process of cell cycle and DNA repair. These mechanisms were confirmed in patient samples.||||The DNA damage repair-related signature was an independent and powerful prognostic biomarker in lower grade glioma.||||The signature may potentially improve risk stratification of patients and provide a more accurate assessment of personalized treatment in clinic.

The proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters PEPT2, PHT1 and PHT2 mediate the uptake of carnosine in glioblastoma cells.||||||||The previous studies demonstrated that carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) inhibits the growth of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Considering carnosine for the treatment of glioblastoma, we investigated which proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) are present in glioblastoma cells and how they contribute to the uptake of carnosine. Therefore, mRNA expression of the four known POTs (PEPT1, PEPT2, PHT1, and PHT2) was examined in three glioblastoma cell lines, ten primary tumor cell cultures, in freshly isolated tumor tissue and in healthy brain. Using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, the uptake of carnosine was investigated in the presence of competitive inhibitors and after siRNA-mediated knockdown of POTs. Whereas PEPT1 mRNA was not detected in any sample, expression of the three other transporters was significantly increased in tumor tissue compared to healthy brain. In cell culture, PHT1 expression was comparable to expression in tumor tissue, PHT2 exhibited a slightly reduced expression, and PEPT2 expression was reduced to normal brain tissue levels. In the cell line LN405, the competitive inhibitors β-alanyl-L-alanine (inhibits all transporters) and L-histidine (inhibitor of PHT1/2) both inhibited the uptake of carnosine. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of PHT1 and PHT2 revealed a significantly reduced uptake of carnosine. Interestingly, despite its low expression at the level of mRNA, knockdown of PEPT2 also resulted in decreased uptake. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the transporters PEPT2, PHT1, and PHT2 are responsible for the uptake of carnosine into glioblastoma cells and full function of all three transporters is required for maximum uptake.

Comprehensive analysis of expression profiles of long non‑coding RNAs with associated ceRNA network involved in gastric cancer progression.||||||||Long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in the development and progression of cancers. The present study aimed to identify novel lncRNAs and associated microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) and mRNAs in gastric cancer. Differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) and differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) of 6 paired gastric cancer and normal tissues were identified using microarray. The DEmiRNAs between gastric cancer and the normal control tissues were identified using miRNA‑seq data from Cancer Genome Atlas. Common DElncRNAs from the Cancer RNA‑Seq Nexus database and circlncRNAnet database were analyzed. A DElncRNAs‑DEmiRNAs‑DEmRNAs network was constructed by target prediction. Functional enrichment analysis was employed to predict the function of DEmRNAs in the network. The correlation between the expression of DElncRNAS and DEmRNAs in the network was analyzed. The expression levels of several genes were validated by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR). A total of 1,297 DElncRNAs, 2,037 DEmRNAs and 171 DEmiRNAs were identified. Among the 4 lncRNAs common to the 3 datasets, prostate androgen‑regulated transcript 1 (PART1) was selected for further analysis. The analysis identified 5 DEmiRNAs and 13 DEmRNAs in the PART1‑mediated ceRNA network. The DEmRNAs in the ceRNA network were markedly enriched in cancer‑related biological processes (response to hypoxia, positive regulation of angiogenesis and positive regulation of endothelial cell proliferation) and pathways (cGMP‑PKG signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway and proteoglycans in cancer). Out of the 13 DEmRNAs, 11 were positively associated with PART1. The downregulation of PART1, myosin light chain 9 (MYL9), potassium calcium‑activated channel subfamily M alpha 1 (KCNMA1), cholinergic receptor muscarinic 1 (CHRM1), solute carrier family 25 member 4 (SLC25A4) and ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 2 (ATP1A2) expression levels in gastric cancer was validated by RT‑qPCR. On the whole, the current study identified a novel lncRNA and associated miRNAs and mRNAs that are involved in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer that may serve as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of gastric cancer.

Roles of sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling in cancer.||||||||The potent pleiotropic lipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) participates in numerous cellular processes, including angiogenesis and cell survival, proliferation, and migration. It is formed by one of two sphingosine kinases (SphKs), SphK1 and SphK2. These enzymes largely exert their various biological and pathophysiological actions through one of five G protein-coupled receptors (S1PR1-5), with receptor activation setting in motion various signaling cascades. Considerable evidence has been accumulated on S1P signaling and its pathogenic roles in diseases, as well as on novel modulators of S1P signaling, such as SphK inhibitors and S1P agonists and antagonists. S1P and ceramide, composed of sphingosine and a fatty acid, are reciprocal cell fate regulators, and S1P signaling plays essential roles in several diseases, including inflammation, cancer, and autoimmune disorders. Thus, targeting of S1P signaling may be one way to block the pathogenesis and may be a therapeutic target in these conditions. Increasingly strong evidence indicates a role for the S1P signaling pathway in the progression of cancer and its effects. In the present review, we discuss recent progress in our understanding of S1P and its related proteins in cancer progression. Also described is the therapeutic potential of S1P receptors and their downstream signaling cascades as targets for cancer treatment.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 reverses chemoresistance by downregulating the expression of P-glycoprotein in gastric cancer.||||||||The emergence of multiple drug resistance (MDR) is the main cause of chemotherapy failure in gastric cancer. In this study, to generate MDR gastric cancer cell lines, we exposed MKN45 and AGS gastric cancer cells to cisplatin, fluorouracil, and adriamycin. Through transcriptome sequencing, we found that interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) was expressed at significantly lower levels in the MDR cell lines than in the parental cell lines. We then established stable clones of MKN45 and SGC7901 cells with a doxycycline-inducible IRF-1 expression system and confirmed that IRF-1 overexpression efficiently reversed the MDR. Further analyses indicated that IRF-1 suppresses P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression in vitro and in vivo, leading to an increase in chemotherapy drug retention. The results showed that IRF-1 bound to the promoter regions of P-gp gene and inhibited P-gp transcription. IFN-γ induced IRF-1-mediated downregulation of P-gp in gastric cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrated that the clinical correlation between IRF-1 and P-gp expression and that IRF-1 serves as an independent prognostic factor for patients with gastric cancer. We conclude that IRF-1 reverses the MDR trait of gastric cancer by downregulating P-gp, and this mechanism has potential treatment implications and is clinically actionable.

Type I interferon (IFN)-inducible Absent in Melanoma 2 proteins in neuroinflammation: implications for Alzheimer's disease.||||||||Cumulative evidence indicates that activation of innate immune responses in the central nervous system (CNS) induces the expression of type 1 interferons (T1 IFNs), a family of cytokines. The T1 IFNs (IFN-α/β), through activation of the JAK/STAT-signaling in microglia, astrocytes, and neurons, induce the expression of IFN-inducible proteins, which mediate the pro- and anti-inflammatory functions of IFNs. Accordingly, T1 IFN-inducible Absent in Melanoma 2 proteins (murine Aim2 and human AIM2) negatively regulate the expression of TI IFNs and, upon sensing higher levels of cytosolic DNA, assemble the Aim2/AIM2 inflammasome, resulting in activation of caspase-1, pyroptosis, and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β and IL-18). Of interest, studies have indicated a role for the Aim2/AIM2 proteins in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The ability of Aim2/AIM2 proteins to exert pro- and anti-inflammatory effects in CNS may depend upon age, sex hormones, cell-types, and the expression of species-specific negative regulators of the Aim2/AIM2 inflammasome. Therefore, we discuss the role of Aim2/AIM2 proteins in the development of AD. An improved understanding of the role of Absent in Melanoma 2 proteins in AD could identify new approaches to treat patients.

However, interestingly, PAM induces more intracellular reactive oxygen species in glioblastoma cells than PAL. To investigate the differences in intracellular molecular mechanisms of the effects of PAM and PAL in glioblastoma cells, we measured gene expression levels of antioxidant genes such as CAT, SOD2, and GPX1. Microarray and quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed that PAM elevated stress-inducible genes that induce apoptosis such as GADD45α signaling molecules. PAL suppressed genes downstream of the survival and proliferation signaling network such as YAP/TEAD signaling molecules. These data reveal that PAM and PAL induce apoptosis in glioblastoma cells by different intracellular molecular mechanisms.

Challenges and strategies for successful clinical development of immune checkpoint inhibitors in glioblastoma.||||||||: Strategies to improve clinical development of CPI in GBM need to carefully address multiple steps that are needed for successful activation and maintenance of tumor-specific immune responses. Multi-modality approaches are needed to achieve this goal and should focus on augmenting tumor T-cell infiltration, activating cytotoxic T-cells, and maintaining their effector function. CPI have been the most successful immunotherapy approach in the treatment of solid cancers and optimization of combinatorial approaches are needed for their successful implementation in GBM.

The TGFβ-miR-499a-SHKBP1 pathway induces resistance to EGFR inhibitors in osteosarcoma cancer stem cell-like cells.||||||||A novel paradigm in tumor biology suggests that osteosarcoma (OS) chemo-resistance is driven by osteosarcoma stem cell-like cells (OSCs). As the sensitivity of only a few tumors to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can be explained by the presence of EGFR tyrosine kinase (TK) domain mutations, there is a need to elucidate mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies in OS that do not harbor TK sensitizing mutations to develop new strategies to circumvent resistance to EGFR inhibitors.||||As a measure of the characters of OSCs, serum-free cultivation, cell viability test with erlotinib, and serial transplantation in vivo was used. Western blot assays were used to detect the association between erlotinib resistance and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression. By using TaqMan qPCR miRNA array, online prediction software, luciferase reporter assays and western blot analysis, we further elucidated the mechanisms.|||| OSCs inhibits TGFβ-induced erlotinib-resistance in vitro and in vivo. SHKBP1, the direct target of miR-499a, regulates EGFR activity reduction occurring concomitantly with a TGFβ-induced EMT-associated kinase switch to an AKT-activated EGFR-independent state. TGFβ-induced activation of AKT co-opts an increased SHKBP1 expression, which further regulates EGFR activity. In clinic, the ratio of the expression levels of SHKBP1 and miR-499a is highly correlated with EMT and resistance to erlotinib.|||| OSCs, implies that inhibition of TGFβ induced EMT-associated kinase switch may reverse the chemo-resistance of OSCs to EGFR inhibitors. We also suggest that an elevated SHKBP1/miR-499a ratio is a molecular signature that characterizes the erlotinib-resistant OS, which may have clinical value as a predictive biomarker.

Combination of pembrolizumab and imatinib in a patient with double KIT mutant melanoma: A case report.||||||||The treatment of metastatic melanoma has been revolutionized in the past decade because of the development of immunotherapies and targeted therapies. Despite these developments, there is still an unmet clinical need for more advanced combination therapies for the subset of patients who remain resistant to immunotherapy or targeted therapy alone. To our knowledge, no reports have been published on combinations of PD-1 blockades and c-KIT inhibitors in melanoma patients. Furthermore, data are limited regarding the safety and efficacy of this combination in patients harboring KIT mutations.||||We report a case of an 82-year-old female with metastatic melanoma who was found to have double KIT mutations at V559 and N822I.||||She was treated with a combination of c-KIT inhibitor and PD-1 blockade after being resistant to anti-PD-1 monotherapy.||||Patient developed two episodes of grade 2 liver toxicity requiring treatment breaks followed by a dose reduction. Her transaminitis eventually resolved and patient remained on combination treatment for almost two years with good control of her disease prior to progression.||||Treatment options for patients who progress after PD-1 inhibitors are very limited; therefore, there is a high unmet clinical need for this patient population. Combining Imatinib with checkpoint inhibitors may be efficacious in patients with metastatic melanoma and KIT mutations. This novel combination can cause additional toxicities which seem to be overall manageable.

The renal hemodynamic effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin are caused by post-glomerular vasodilatation rather than pre-glomerular vasoconstriction in metformin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes in the randomized, double-blind RED trial.||||||||Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) improve hard renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes. This is possibly explained by the fact that SGLT2i normalize the measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) by increasing renal vascular resistance, as was shown in young people with type 1 diabetes and glomerular hyperfiltration. Therefore, we compared the renal hemodynamic effects of dapagliflozin with gliclazide in type 2 diabetes. The mGFR and effective renal plasma flow were assessed using inulin and para-aminohippurate clearances in the fasted state, during clamped euglycemia (5 mmol/L) and during clamped hyperglycemia (15 mmol/L). Filtration fraction and renal vascular resistance were calculated. Additionally, factors known to modulate renal hemodynamics were measured. In 44 people with type 2 diabetes on metformin monotherapy (Hemoglobin A1c 7.4%, mGFR 113 mL/min), dapagliflozin versus gliclazide reduced mGFR by 5, 10, and 12 mL/min in the consecutive phases while both agents similarly improved Hemoglobin A1c (-0.48% vs -0.65%). Dapagliflozin also reduced filtration fraction without increasing renal vascular resistance, and increased urinary adenosine and prostaglandin concentrations. Gliclazide did not consistently alter renal hemodynamic parameters. Thus, beyond glucose control, SGLT2i reduce mGFR and filtration fraction in type 2 diabetes. The fact that renal vascular resistance was not increased by dapagliflozin suggests that this is due to post-glomerular vasodilation rather than pre-glomerular vasoconstriction.

Adiponectin, Obesity, and Cancer: Clash of the Bigwigs in Health and Disease.||||||||Adiponectin is one of the most important adipocytokines secreted by adipocytes and is called a "guardian angel adipocytokine" owing to its unique biological functions. Adiponectin inversely correlates with body fat mass and visceral adiposity. Identified independently by four different research groups, adiponectin has multiple names; Acrp30, apM1, GBP28, and AdipoQ. Adiponectin mediates its biological functions via three known receptors, AdipoR1, AdipoR2, and T-cadherin, which are distributed throughout the body. Biological functions of adiponectin are multifold ranging from anti-diabetic, anti-atherogenic, anti-inflammatory to anti-cancer. Lower adiponectin levels have been associated with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension. A plethora of experimental evidence supports the role of obesity and increased adiposity in multiple cancers including breast, liver, pancreatic, prostrate, ovarian, and colorectal cancers. Obesity mediates its effect on cancer progression via dysregulation of adipocytokines including increased production of oncogenic adipokine leptin along with decreased production of adiponectin. Multiple studies have shown the protective role of adiponectin in obesity-associated diseases and cancer. Adiponectin modulates multiple signaling pathways to exert its physiological and protective functions. Many studies over the years have shown the beneficial effect of adiponectin in cancer regression and put forth various innovative ways to increase adiponectin levels.

CREB5 Promotes Resistance to Androgen-Receptor Antagonists and Androgen Deprivation in Prostate Cancer.||||||||Androgen-receptor (AR) inhibitors, including enzalutamide, are used for treatment of all metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers (mCRPCs). However, some patients develop resistance or never respond. We find that the transcription factor CREB5 confers enzalutamide resistance in an open reading frame (ORF) expression screen and in tumor xenografts. CREB5 overexpression is essential for an enzalutamide-resistant patient-derived organoid. In AR-expressing prostate cancer cells, CREB5 interactions enhance AR activity at a subset of promoters and enhancers upon enzalutamide treatment, including MYC and genes involved in the cell cycle. In mCRPC, we found recurrent amplification and overexpression of CREB5. Our observations identify CREB5 as one mechanism that drives resistance to AR antagonists in prostate cancers.

Tapering and discontinuation of thrombopoietin receptor agonists in immune thrombocytopenia: Real-world recommendations.||||||||Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) are currently indicated for continuous treatment of chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). However, there is growing evidence that TPO-RAs can also trigger sustained response in 10-30% of cases after treatment tapering and discontinuation. Therefore, at least for selected responding patients, it might be rational to plan TPO-RA interruption to exploit off-treatment response. Intriguingly, complete or partial responses with TPO-RAs are frequently observed when treatments are initiated early, suggesting that unknown immune-related mechanisms may be involved in this phenomenon. The sustained responses observed after interruption of TPO-RAs may be interpreted as a recovery of immunological tolerance; thus, the re-establishment of immunological equilibrium might be primarily responsible for the observed off-treatment effect. Importantly, these findings may indicate that anticipated TPO-RA usage can lead to improved responses, and that optimized tapering and interruption in selected patients can furthermore improve prognoses. On the base of this rationale, a series of real-life considerations have been generated by a panel of Experts to elucidate possible novel criteria and modalities to identify subgroups of patients who can benefit from tapering and/or discontinuation of TPO-RAs. Towards this aim, the results of a survey of ITP experts are herein reported, reflecting a snapshot of current real-life experience on early discontinuation of TPO-RA-based therapy. The present manuscript also highlights the importance of future translational studies on novel prognostic and predictive biomarkers that can stratify patients and facilitate the clinical choice for second-line treatment of ITP.

High cholesterol levels are positively correlated with the risk of various types of cancer. APOA-I binding protein (AIBP) promotes the reverse cholesterol transport pathway (RCT) in cooperation with Apolipoprotein A-I (APOA-I) or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, the combined effect of AIBP and APOA-I on intestinal tumor cells is still unclear.||||Immunohistochemistry, western blot and qPCR were performed to investigate the expression of AIBP and APOA-I in intestinal tumor tissues and cell lines. The anti-tumor activity of AIBP and APOA-I was evaluated by overexpression or recombinant protein treatment. Cholesterol efflux and localization of lipid raft-related proteins were analyzed by a cholesterol efflux assay and lipid raft fraction assay, respectively.|||| mice as an inherited intestinal tumor model. The synergistic effect of the two proteins inhibited colon cancer cell migration, invasion and tumor-induced angiogenesis by promoting cholesterol efflux, reducing the membrane raft content, and eventually disrupting the proper localization of migration- and invasion-related proteins on the membrane raft. Moreover, cyclosporine A, a cholesterol efflux inhibitor, rescued the inhibitory effect induced by the combination of AIBP and APOA-I.||||These results indicate that the combination of APOA-I and AIBP has an obvious anticancer effect on colorectal cancer by promoting cholesterol efflux.

Whey protein in cancer therapy: A narrative review.||||||||Cancer remains a public health challenge in the identification and development of ideal pharmacological therapies and dietary strategies. The use of whey protein as a dietary strategy is widespread in the field of oncology. The two types of whey protein, sweet or acid, result from several processing techniques and possess distinct protein subfraction compositions. Mechanistically, whey protein subfractions have specific anti-cancer effects. Alpha-lactalbumin, human α-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cell, bovine α-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cell, bovine serum albumin, and lactoferrin are whey protein subfractions with potential to hinder tumor pathways. Such effects, however, are principally supported by studies performed in vitro and/or in vivo. In clinical practice, whey protein intake-induced anti-cancer effects are indiscernible. However, whey protein supplementation represents a practical, feasible, and cost-effective approach to mitigate cancer cachexia syndrome. The usefulness of whey protein is evidenced by a greater leucine content and the potential to modulate IGF-1 concentrations, representing important factors towards musculoskeletal hypertrophy. Further clinical trials are warranted and needed to establish the effects of whey protein supplementation as an adjuvant to cancer therapy.

The role of NOX inhibitors in neurodegenerative diseases.||||||||Oxidative stress is a key player in both chronic and acute brain disease due to the higher metabolic demand of the brain. Among the producers of free radicals, NADPH-oxidase (NOX) is a major contributor to oxidative stress in neurological disorders. In the brain, the superoxide produced by NOX is mainly found in leukocytes. However, recent studies have reported that it can be found in several other cell types. NOX has been reported to regulate neuronal signaling, memory processing, and central cardiovascular homeostasis. However, overproduction of NOX can contribute to neurotoxicity, CNS degeneration, and cardiovascular disorders. Regarding the above functions, NOX has been shown to play a crucial role in chronic CNS diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and in acute CNS disorders such as stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and related cerebrovascular diseases. NOX is a multi-subunit complex consisting of two membrane-associated and four cytosolic subunits. Thus, in recent years, inhibition of NOX activity has drawn a great deal of attention from researchers in the field of treating chronic and acute CNS disorders and preventing secondary complications. Mounting evidence has shown that NOX inhibition is neuroprotective and that inhibiting NOX in circulating immune cells can improve neurological disease conditions. This review summarizes recent studies on the therapeutic effects and pharmacological strategies regarding NOX inhibitors in chronic and acute brain diseases and focuses on the hurdles that should be overcome before their clinical implementation.

Reduction of IL-2 fragmentation during manufacturing of a novel immunocytokine by DoE process optimization.||||||||Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a potent molecule in cancer therapy. Clinical application, however, is limited due to its strong side effects during the treatment. We developed an IL-2 variant (IL-2v) immunocytokine to circumvent the drawbacks of the current IL-2 therapy. During the production of the IL-2v immunocytokine in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, molecules with fragmented IL-2v and therefore reduced cytokine activity can be observed. To control product fragmentation different production process conditions were investigated. By shifting temperature or pH after the cell growth phase to lower values, fragmented species can be reduced from 10% to 12% to about 4%. However, with the adopted process conditions, the effective titer is decreased concomitantly. Moreover, fermentation length and inoculation cell density are parameters to adjust fragmentation and effective titer. A suitable method for efficient process optimization is the design of experiment approach. With this procedure, novel optimal values for temperature, pH value, harvest day, and inoculation cell densities were proposed and tested subsequently. In comparison to the former process, the improved process reduces fragmentation by 66% while keeping the effective titer comparable. In summary, these findings will help to control fragmentation in CHO production processes of different IL-2v or IL-2 containing therapeutic proteins.

Sodium fluoride in cardiovascular disorders: A systematic review.||||||||18-Fluorine sodium fluoride is a well-known radiotracer used for bone metastasis diagnosis. Its uptake correlation with cardiovascular (CV) risk was primarily suggested in oncological patients. Moreover, as a specific marker of microcalcification, it seems to correlate with CV disease progression and plaque instability.||||Our purpose was to systematically review clinical studies that characterized the use of this marker in CV conditions. In atherosclerosis, most studies report a positive correlation with the burden of CV risk factors and vascular calcification. A higher uptake was found in culprit plaques/rupture sites in coronary and carotid arteries and it was also linked to high-risk features in histology and intravascular imaging analysis of the plaques. In aortic stenosis, this tracer displayed an increasing uptake with disease severity.||||Sodium fluoride positron emission tomography is a promising non-invasive technique to identify high-risk plaques, which sets ground to a potential use of this tracer in evaluating atherosclerotic disease progression and degenerative changes in aortic valve stenosis. Nevertheless, there is a need for further prospective evidence that demonstrates this technique's value in predicting clinical events, adjusting treatment strategies, and improving patient outcomes.
