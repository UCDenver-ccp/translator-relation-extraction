BAP1 in solid tumors.||||||||One of the most attractive cancer-related genes under investigation is BAP1. Reasons of this growing interest are related to the wide spectrum of pathways directly or indirectly modulated by this gene and shared by several solid tumors. Programmed cell-death, cell metabolisms, immune cells development, ferroptosis and defects in DNA damage response are only some of the multitude of processes depending on BAP1. Loss of this gene seems to occur in different times of tumor history. Moreover, times of BAP1 loss strongly diverge among primary tumors suggesting the presence of several and different triggering factors. Regardless of when it happens, BAP1 loss usually results in prognosis worsening and in the acquisition of more aggressive clinical features by cancer cells.

Role of CD44 in breast cancer.||||||||Breast cancer (BC) is among the most prevalent type of malignancy affecting females worldwide. BC is classified into different types according to the status of the expression of receptors such as estrogen receptor (ER), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and progesterone receptor (PR). Androgen receptor (AR) appears to be a promising therapeutic target of breast cancer. Binding of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to AR controls the expression of microRNA (miRNA) molecules in BC, consequently, affecting protein expression. One of these proteins is the transmembrane glycoprotein cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44). Remarkably, CD44 is a common marker of cancer stem cells in BC. It functions as a co-receptor for a broad diversity of extracellular matrix ligands. Several ligands, primarily hyaluronic acid, can interact with CD44 and mediate its functions. CD44 promotes a variety of functions independently or in cooperation with other cell-surface receptors through activation of varied signaling pathways like Rho GTPases, Ras-MAPK, and PI3K/AKT pathways to regulate cell adhesion, migration, survival, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In this review, we present the relations between AR, miRNA, and CD44 and their roles in BC.

TGF-β/Smad and Renal Fibrosis.||||||||Renal fibrosis is characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) that disrupts and replaces functional parenchyma, which leads to organ failure. It is known as the major pathological mechanism of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although CKD has an impact on no less than 10% of the world population, therapeutic options are still limited. Regardless of etiology, elevated TGF-β levels are highly correlated with the activated pro-fibrotic pathways and disease progression. TGF-β, the key driver of renal fibrosis, is involved in a dynamic pathophysiological process that leads to CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It is becoming clear that epigenetics regulates renal programming, and therefore, the development and progression of renal disease. Indeed, recent evidence shows TGF-β1/Smad signaling regulates renal fibrosis via epigenetic-correlated mechanisms. This review focuses on the function of TGF-β/Smads in renal fibrogenesis, and the role of epigenetics as a regulator of pro-fibrotic gene expression.

PRMT5, a member of the PRMT family, is overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers and its activity is associated with cell transformation. Moreover, its expression is associated with a decrease in patient survival in several cancers, a rationale for developing highly potent inhibitors of its enzymatic activity. However, most studies do not take into account the subcellular localization of PRMT5, which can modify its properties. Indeed, our team recently showed that PRMT5 nuclear expression is associated with prolonged survival. These results corroborated findings in prostate cancer, in which the nuclear fraction of PRMT5 was responsible for inhibiting cell growth, while the cytoplasmic fraction promoted cell growth. In conclusion, this criterion should be evaluated prior to administering PRMT5 inhibitors, which may have adverse effects.

S100 proteins in atherosclerosis.||||||||Atherosclerosis is an arterial disease associated with dyslipidemia, abnormal arterial calcification and oxidative stress. It has been shown that a continued chronic inflammatory state of the arterial wall contributes to the development of atherosclerosis. The inflammatory stimulation, recruitment of inflammatory cells and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines enhances vascular inflammation. Some members of the S100 proteins family bind with their receptors, such as advanced glycation end products (RAGE), scavenger receptors (CD36) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), contributing to the cellular response in atherosclerotic progression. This review summarizes the roles of S100 proteins (S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12) in the vascular inflammation, vascular calcification and vascular oxidative stress. S100 proteins are released from monocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells in response to cellular stress stimuli, and then the binding of S100 proteins to RAGE activate downstream signaling such as transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB) translocation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which act as a positive feedback loop for inducing pro-inflammatory phenotype in a wide variety of cell types including endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and leukocytes. Thus, it suggests that the inhibition of S100 proteins-mediated RAGE and TLR4 activation appears to be a promising approach to treat atherosclerosis. In addition, recent study showed that serum S100A12 can predict future cardiovascular events, highlighting that S100A12 is likely to be a potential biomarker of therapeutic efficacy and disease progression in coronary heart disease. Future studies of patients with coronary heart disease may provide more evidences supporting that S100 proteins is promising drug target in the prevention and therapy of atherosclerosis.

ALDH2 and Cardiovascular Disease.||||||||Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is a non-cytochrome P450 mitochondrial aldehyde oxidizing enzyme. It is best known for its role in the metabolism of acetaldehyde, a common metabolite from alcohol drinking. More evidences have been accumulated in recent years to indicate a greater role of ALDH2 in the metabolism of other endogenous and exogenous aldehydes, especially lipid peroxidation-derived reactive aldehyde under oxidative stress. Many cardiovascular diseases are associated with oxidative stress and mitochondria dysfunction. Considering that an estimated 560 million East Asians carry a common ALDH2 deficient variant which causes the well-known alcohol flushing syndrome due to acetaldehyde accumulation, the importance of understanding the role of ALDH2 in these diseases should be highlighted. There are several unfavorable cardiovascular conditions that are associated with ALDH2 deficiency. This chapter reviews the function of ALDH2 in various pathological conditions of the heart in relation to aldehyde toxicity. It also highlights the importance and clinical implications of interaction between ALDH2 deficiency and alcohol drinking on cardiovascular disease among the East Asians.

B7-H3 and its role in bone cancers.||||||||Most bone cancers have a high risk of metastasis, recurrence, and poor prognosis. Although conventional treatments are still the most important therapy, disadvantages still exist. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop effective strategies. Immunotherapy is a promising therapy. Immunotherapies targeting checkpoints have proven to be successful, but B7-H3 (CD276, clusters of differentiation protein 276), a member of the B7-family of co-stimulatory molecules, is not being widely studied in bone cancers. This review summarized the studies on B7-H3 in bone cancers. 4 studies investigated B7-H3 expression in osteosarcoma, but there is no study on B7-H3 expression in chondrosarcoma. Two studies investigated the possibility to treat Ewing`s sarcoma through targeting the B7-H3 CAR (chimeric antigen receptors) T-cells or using anti-B7-H3 antibody. A study observed the growth of myeloma in B7-H3-deficient mice and the therapeutic effect of B7-H3 antibody and a study invested B7-H3 expression in myeloma patients. One study reported B7-H3 expression in osteoclastomas and one study investigated B7-H3 expression in chordoma tumor tissues. Two clinical trials are conducting on the therapy of osteosarcoma and myeloma using B7-H3 as a target. In conclusion, B7-H3 could be a target of bone cancers.

In addition to her elevated muscle enzyme level and magnetic resonance imaging, myopathy was highly suspected considering progression of symptoms. Nerve conduction studies and electromyogram suggested myopathy. The muscle biopsy revealed severe dystrophic features with many reducing bodies on hematoxylin and eosin, nicotinomide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase-tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR), and modified Gomori stains and ubiquitin immunohistochemistry. Whole-exome sequencing revealed Xq26.3 encoding FHL1 missense mutations (NM_001159704) in exon 4: p.C150R, c.T448C. FHL1-mutated "reducing body myopathy" is worth reporting based on its rarity and unique clinicopathologic features including ultrastructure. The confirmative diagnosis is still very difficult before gene analysis because clinical and pathological features of this disease overlap with other myofibrillar myopathies. We stress the importance of genotype-phenotype correlation to obtain a precise diagnosis.

In 2012, a new concept referred as "glymphatic system" was proposed by Nedergaard's group, where aquaporin4 (AQP4) may play an important role as well as sleep. AQP4 is mainly expressed in the central nervous system, especially in the foot processes of astrocytes; surrounding the capillary, beneath pia matter and lining the ventricles. The unique distribution of AQP4 suggest that AQP4 might play a role in brain water homeostasis. The concept of "glymphatic system" is still controversial, and needs to be clarified with new experimental data. This approach will lead to the better understanding of roles of astrocytes in neurodegenerative diseases and pharmacokinetics inside the brain, and eventually will facilitate the development of new drugs for sleep or mental disorders. It has been accumulating evidence that sleep disturbance is related to several kinds of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. In addition, the number of patients with dementia are significantly increasing. It is therefore critical to understand the physiological and pathological mechanisms of brain lymphatic system from the medical and social point of views.

Adiponectin, exercise and eye diseases.||||||||Adiponectin, one kind of adipokines, has been shown to be neuroprotective in different neurodegenerative diseases. Adiponectin exerts its role through combination with its receptors and activates downstream molecular pathways. In the retinas, the expression of adiponectin can be detected and adiponectin receptors (AdipoRs) locate in different retinal cells. Adiponectin is mainly produced by adipose tissue, enters the circulation and passes through blood-brain barrier (BBB) without injury. It can also be produced locally in the brains as well as in the retinas. Therefore, it is possible that adiponectin from blood as well as that produced locally in the retinas take part in defense of different eye diseases. Here we have summarized the published data about the protective effects of adiponectin in eye diseases. Because exercise can increase the production of adiponectin systemically in the whole body and locally in the brain although no evidence has shown that exercise can increase the production of adiponectin in the eyes until now, we hypothesize that exercise will have a potential protective effect for the eyes via increasing the levels of adiponectin which needs further investigation.

All participants received a multidimensional geriatric evaluation and underwent blood sampling. HbA1c, OPG, CTX and OC were measured and DXA scans were performed. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was measured in all outpatients. Diabetic patients had more comorbidities, higher mean values of lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD and T-score, lower circulating levels of OC and CTX, and higher circulating levels of OPG compared to non-diabetic subjects. OPG was directly correlated with HbA1c. This association was most evident in non-fractured elderly subjects. Moreover, diabetic patients with IMT>1.5 mm had greater mean values of OPG than non-diabetic subjects with high IMT and than elderly subjects with IMT < 1.5 mm, with and without T2DM.||||Diabetic patients have reduced circulating levels of OC and CTX, and elevated serum levels of OPG, suggesting a state of low bone turnover. Reduced bone turnover causes an increase of BMD and could lead to a poor bone quality. OPG and HbA1c were directly correlated and OPG mean values were higher in diabetic patients with poor glucose control. Diabetic osteopathy could be considered a late complication of T2DM, directly related with the degree of glucose control and the duration of the disease.

Role of OCT1 in hepatocellular carcinoma.||||||||Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers causing death worldwide. It is difficult to detect at an early stage and most patients with advanced HCC rarely achieve satisfying therapeutic results. Accordingly, researchers have been trying to find new biomarkers for diagnosis and new methods of treatment. OCT1, a member of solute carrier super family, is highly expressed in normal liver tissues, and predominantly transports endogenous and exogenous substances, such as metabolites, drugs and toxins to hepatocytes. Studies have demonstrated that the expression of OCT1 is related to the progression and survival of HCC patients. Furthermore, sorafenib, which is regarded as the only effective molecular targeting drug for advanced HCC, is affected by OCT1 variants. In the current review, we summarized the reports about OCT1 and HCC in order to present a comprehensive overview of the relationship between OCT1 and HCC.

Obesity and Breast Cancer: Role of Leptin.||||||||Obesity-related breast cancer is an important threat that affects especially post-menopausal women. The link between obesity and breast cancer seems to be relying on the microenvironment generated at adipose tissue level, which includes inflammatory cytokines. In addition, its association with systemic endocrine changes, including hyperinsulinemia, increased estrogens levels, and hyperleptinemia may be key factors for tumor development. These factors may promote tumor initiation, tumor primary growth, tissue invasion, and metastatic progression. Although the relationship between obesity and breast cancer is already established, the different pathophysiological mechanisms involved are not clear. Obesity-related insulin resistance is a well-known risk factor for breast cancer development in post-menopausal women. However, the role of inflammation and other adipokines, especially leptin, is less studied. Leptin, like insulin, appears to be a growth factor for breast cancer cells. There exists a link between leptin and metabolism of estrogens and between leptin and other factors in a more complex network. As a result, obesity-associated hyperleptinemia has been suggested as an important mediator in the pathophysiology of breast cancer. On the other hand, recent data on the paradoxical effect of obesity on cancer immunotherapy efficacy has brought some controversy, since the proinflammatory effect of leptin may help the effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, a better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that mediate leptin action may be helpful to understand the underlying processes which link obesity to breast cancer in post-menopausal women, as well as the possible role of leptin in the response to immunotherapy in obese patients.

Role of SIRT1 in hematologic malignancies.||||||||Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a protein deacetylase, which regulates various physiological activities by deacetylating different protein substrates. An increasing number of studies have revealed critical roles of SIRT1 in different aspects of cancers including metabolism, proliferation, genomic instability, and chemotherapy resistance. Depending on the protein targets in a certain oncogenic context, SIRT1 may play a unique role in each individual blood cancer subtype. Our previous work showed that activation of SIRT1 in primitive leukemia cells of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) promotes disease maintenance. On the other hand, an SIRT1 agonist was shown to disrupt maintenance of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) stem cells and holds promise as a potential therapeutic approach. Herein, we present a concise summary of the different functions of SIRT1 in hematologic malignancies.

The analysis of cancer genome sequencing data classified SOX17 as mutated cancer driver gene in endometrial cancer. These studies identified hotspot missense mutations within its DNA binding and transactivation domains. In somatic cell reprogramming, structure-based protein re-engineering showed a single missense mutation in SOX17 can change the DNA dependent heterodimer formation with OCT4 and enables the replacement of SOX2 with SOX17 mutants to induce pluripotency. This reveals the profound impact of specific missense mutations on gene function and regulatory activity. Here, we review the roles of SOX17 in cancer and discuss its cross-talk with the WNT/β-catenin pathway, potentially reconciling its activity as re-engineered reprogramming factor and mutated cancer driver gene.

The role of Clusterin in cancer metastasis.||||||||Clusterin is a conserved glycoprotein that has been characterized from almost all human tissues and fluids and plays a key role in cellular stress response and survival. Recently, research efforts have been contributed to explore the function of Clusterin in cancer metastasis, which is particularly important to design the strategies for treating metastatic patients. Evidence collected has demonstrated that Clusterin is overexpressed in tumor metastatic patients and experimental metastasis models. Specifically, Clusterin has been shown to have the role in anti-apoptotic capacities, development of therapy resistance and induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, all associated with cancer metastasis. Inhibition of Clusterin is known to increase the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents and improves advanced cancer patients survival in clinical trials. Our unpublished data have demonstrated that Clusterin is overexpressed in bladder cancer and metformin, a well-known metabolism modulator specifically targets Clusterin by inhibiting migration of bladder cancer cells. In this review, we provide a general view of how Clusterin modulates cancer metastasis and update current understanding of detailed molecular mechanisms underlying of Clusterin for developing cancer management in future.

The ubiquitin ligase adaptor SPOP in cancer.||||||||The dysregulation of ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation has emerged as an important mechanism of pathogenesis in several cancers. The speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) functions as a substrate adaptor for the cullin3-RING ubiquitin ligase and controls the cellular persistence of a diverse array of protein substrates in hormone signalling, epigenetic control and cell cycle regulation, to name a few. Mutations in SPOP and the resulting dysregulation of this proteostatic pathway play causative roles in the pathogenesis of prostate and endometrial cancers, whereas overexpression and mislocalization are associated with kidney cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanism of the normal function of SPOP as well as the cause of SPOP-mediated oncogenesis is thus critical for eventual therapeutic targeting of SPOP and other related pathways. Here, we will review SPOP structure, function and the molecular mechanism of how this function is achieved. We will then review how mutations and protein mislocalization contribute to cancer pathogenesis and will provide a perspective on how SPOP may be targeted therapeutically.

Intrinsic molecular genetics, cancer characteristics, and breast tissue immune responses in diverse metastases to the breast have not been previously studied. We identified 64 patients with cancers metastatic to the breast: 51 carcinomas and 13 melanomas. Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), steroid receptors, and HER2/neu expressions were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Gene sequencing, copy number alterations, microsatellite instability, and tumor mutational burden were performed using next-generation sequencing platforms. The 3 most common primary sites for metastatic carcinomas were lung (37%), ovary (29%), and fallopian tubes/peritoneum (14%). TP53 mutations were commonly (50%) observed among the carcinoma cases, while other mutations were characteristic for the primary cancers (VHL in renal, BRCA1 in the fallopian tube, and BRAF in melanomas). High tumor mutational burden was detected in 5/14 carcinomas and 3/7 melanomas. Tumor cell PD-L1 expression was detected in 6 carcinomas, but not in any of the melanomas, whereas immune cells' expression of PD-L1 was seen in 17 carcinomas and 6 melanomas. Estrogen receptor status was positive in 13/49 carcinomas including 12 adenocarcinomas originating from the ovary and fallopian tube or peritoneum and 1 duodenal neuroendocrine carcinoma. No carcinoma was HER2/neu positive. Intrinsic genetic characteristics of the metastases to the breast followed the pattern commonly seen in primary tumors. Biomarkers of potential benefit to immune checkpoint inhibition therapy were limited to PD-L1-positive non-small cell lung cancer. No common characteristics of the heterogeneous group of tumor metastases to this organ were identified.

Addition of IMP3 to L1CAM for discrimination between low- and high-grade endometrial carcinomas: a European Network for Individualised Treatment of Endometrial Cancer collaboration study.||||||||Discrimination between low- and high-grade endometrial carcinomas (ECs) is clinically relevant but can be challenging for pathologists, with moderate interobserver agreement. Insulin-like growth factor-II mRNA-binding protein 3 (IMP3) is an oncofoetal protein that is associated with nonendometrioid endometrial carcinomas but has been limited studied in endometrioid carcinomas. The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of IMP3 in the discrimination between low- and high-grade ECs and its added value to L1CAM. IMP3 and L1CAM expression was assessed in tumors from 378 patients treated for EC at 1 of 9 participating European Network for Individualised Treatment of Endometrial Cancer centers. IMP3 was expressed in 24.6% of the tumors. In general, IMP3 was more homogeneously expressed than L1CAM. IMP3 expression was significantly associated with advanced stage, nonendometrioid histology, grade 3 tumors, deep myometrial invasion, lymphovascular space invasion, distant recurrences, overall mortality, and disease-related mortality. Simultaneous absence of IMP3 and L1CAM expression showed the highest accuracy for identifying low-grade carcinomas (area under the curve 0.766), whereas simultaneous expression of IMP3 and L1CAM was strongly associated with high-grade carcinomas (odds ratio 19.7; 95% confidence interval 9.2-42.2). Even within endometrioid carcinomas, this combination remained superior to IMP3 and L1CAM alone (odds ratio 8.6; 95% confidence interval 3.4-21.9). In conclusion, IMP3 has good diagnostic value and together with L1CAM represents the optimal combination of diagnostic markers for discrimination between low- and high-grade ECs compared to IMP3 and L1CAM alone. Because of the homogenous expression of IMP3, this marker might be valuable in preoperative biopsies when compared to the more patchy L1CAM expression.

The Roles of TIF1γ in Cancer.||||||||Transcriptional intermediary factor 1 γ (TIF1γ), also known as TRIM33, RFG7, PTC7, or Ectodermin, is an E3 ubiquitin-ligase family member with a ring-box-coiled-coil region. It can regulate TGF-β/Smad signaling in two different ways in different cellular contexts. On one hand, TIF1γ can monoubiquitinate Smad4 to inhibit the formation of Smad2/3/4 nuclear complexes. On the other hand, TIF1γ can function as a cofactor of phosphorylated (p)-Smad2/3, competing with Smad4 to inhibit the formation of the Smad2/3/4 complex. In addition, TIF1γ has been reported to play a role in transcription elongation, cellular differentiation, embryonic development, and mitosis. As transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily signaling plays an important role in the occurrence and development of cancer, and TIF1γ was reported to be involved in the regulation of TGF-β superfamily signaling, studies on TIF1γ during the last decade have focused on its role in the development of cancer. However, TIF1γ can function either as a tumor suppressor or promoter in different cellular contexts, yet there are few reviews focusing on the roles of TIF1γ in cancer. Hence, in this paper we systematically review and discuss the roles of TIF1γ in cancer. Firstly, we review the biological features, the regulatory mechanisms and the related signaling pathways of TIF1γ. Next, we illustrate the roles of TIF1γ in different tumors. We then provide a tentative hypothesis that explains the dual roles of TIF1 γ in cancer. Finally, we provide our viewpoint regarding the future developments of cancer research focusing on TIF1γ, especially in relation to the effects of TIF1γ on tumoral immunity.

As for a result, serum periostin can serve as a valuable marker to identify patients with type-2 severe asthma who are insensitive to inhaled corticosteroids, and consequently have the excess decline of pulmonary function with asthma exacerbations.

Mismatch Repair Deficiency in Endometrial Cancer: Immunohistochemistry Staining and Clinical Implications.||||||||DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency is associated with increased risk of developing several types of cancer and is the most common cause of hereditary endometrial cancer. Identification of the microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype in endometrial carcinoma is important given that such tumors are frequent.||||The objective of this study was to assess the utility of immunohistochemistry (IHC), a simple and fast technique, in detecting MSI status in endometrial carcinoma and evaluate the correlation between the MSI phenotype and the various anatomo-clinical parameters.||||IHC expression of 4 markers (MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, and MSH6) was studied. For all IHC markers, a combined score based on the intensity of nuclear labeling and the percentage of labeled cells was defined to establish a score. Correlation between MSI phenotype and different clinicopathologic parameters was evaluated using statistical analysis (software STATA and the Fisher exact test).||||The mean age of the patients was 58.6 years. Positive staining was highly extended (score 3) with 79% to 100% of marked cells. Less than 10% of positive tumor cells were seen in 3% of cases for MSH6 and PMS2. Abnormal MMR IHC was detected in 10 cases (22.22%). Seven tumors showed loss of MLH1/PMS2. The loss of MSH2/MSH6 was observed in 1 case. The loss of MLH1 or PMS2 was seen only in 2 cases. The number of MSI positive status was 10 cases (22.7%). Correlation between clinicopathologic parameters showed MMR deficiency was significantly associated with low-grade tumor and localized stage. There was no positive correlation between age, histologic subtype, or myometrium invasion.||||In summary, detection of DNA MMR deficiencies by IHC can effectively diagnose the MSI phenotype in endometrial carcinoma. Correlation between clinicopathologic parameters showed MMR deficiency was significantly associated with low-grade tumor and localized stage.

Attention has been paid to the role of IL-1 in the pathogenesis of the disease, and to the significance of a genetic test, investigating the presence of composite two polymorphisms of IL-1 gene, as a risk factor for severe periodontitis. The significance of this test for prevention of periodontitis and its therapy has been discussed. IL-1 polymorphisms have been presented and described according to the reference single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identification number (rsID), established to eradicate the redundancy of reported polymorphisms in the SNP database processed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The prevalence of these genotypes in different populations and ethnic groups and its effect on periodontal health have been discussed. The presented data show inconsistent results. It seems that at least two polymorphisms, rs1800587 and rs1143634, are associated with periodontal inflammation. Therefore, they can be regarded as candidate genes involved in further periodontitis risk assessment. It seems that geographical and ethnical factors can play a great role, as the prevalence of specific polymorphisms varies greatly depending on the population studied.

This review summarizes the structure, proteinase inhibition ability, genetic and epigenetic regulation, cancer therapy potential, and contribution to cancer development of TIMP-3. Furthermore, in this review we discuss its potential as a biomarker for predicting cancer progression and the current state of drugs that target TIMP-3, either alone or in combination with clinical treatment. In conclusion, TIMP-3 can be a biomarker of cancer and a potential target for cancer therapy.

A proposal of structural and functional classification.||||||||The human TET2 gene plays a pivotal role in the epigenetic regulation of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Somatic TET2 mutations have been repeatedly identified in age-related clonal hematopoiesis and in myeloid neoplasms ranging from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to myeloproliferative neoplasms. However, there have been no attempts to systematically explore the structural and functional consequences of the hundreds of TET2 missense variants reported to date.||||We have sequenced the TET2 gene in 189 Spanish AML patients using Sanger sequencing and NGS protocols. Next, we performed a thorough bioinformatics analysis of TET2 protein and of the expected impact of all reported TET2 missense variants on protein structure and function, exploiting available structure-and-function information as well as 3D structure prediction tools.||||We have identified 38 TET2 allelic variants in the studied patients, including two frequent SNPs: p.G355D (10 cases) and p.I1762V (28 cases). Four of the detected mutations are reported here for the first time: c.122C>T (p.P41L), c.4535C>G (p.A1512G), c.4760A>G (p.D1587G), and c.5087A>T (p.Y1696F). We predict a complex multidomain architecture for the noncatalytic regions of TET2, and in particular the presence of well-conserved α+β globular domains immediately preceding and following the actual catalytic unit. Further, we provide a rigorous interpretation of over 430 missense SNVs that affect the TET2 catalytic domain, and we hypothesize explanations for ~700 additional variants found within the regulatory regions of the protein. Finally, we propose a systematic classification of all missense mutants and SNPs reported to date into three major categories (severe, moderate, and mild), based on their predicted structural and functional impact.||||The proposed classification of missense TET2 variants would help to assess their clinical impact on human neoplasia and may guide future structure-and-function investigations of TET family members.

FGFR3 expression in cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) tissues was positively correlated with the Breslow thickness and lymph node metastasis. In A357 cells, knockdown of the FGFR3 gene decreased the colony formation ability, cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, but increased the caspase 3 activity and the apoptosis rate; overexpression of FGFR3 increased the colony formation ability, cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, but decreased the caspase 3 activity and apoptosis rates. FGFR3 knockdown also upregulated E-cadherin, downregulated N-cadherin and vimentin, and decreased the phosphorylation levels of ERK, AKT, and EGFR. In the MCC xenografts mice, knockdown of FGFR3 decreased tumor growth and metastasis.||||FGFR3, which is highly expressed in CMM tissues, is correlated with increased Breslow thickness and lymph node metastasis.

Inhibitors of HSP90 in melanoma.||||||||HSP90 (heat shock protein 90) is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone involved in a proper folding and maturation of hundreds of proteins. HSP90 is abundantly expressed in cancer, including melanoma. HSP90 client proteins are the key oncoproteins of several signaling pathways controlling melanoma development, progression and response to therapy. A number of natural and synthetic compounds of different chemical structures and binding sites within HSP90 have been identified as selective HSP90 inhibitors. The majority of HSP90-targeting agents affect N-terminal ATPase activity of HSP90. In contrast to N-terminal inhibitors, agents interacting with the middle and C-terminal domains of HSP90 do not induce HSP70-dependent cytoprotective response. Several inhibitors of HSP90 were tested against melanoma in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, providing evidence that these agents can be considered either as single or complementary therapeutic strategy. This review summarizes current knowledge on the role of HSP90 protein in cancer with focus on melanoma, and provides an overview of structurally different HSP90 inhibitors that are considered as potential therapeutics for melanoma treatment.

ESR1 mutations in breast cancer.||||||||The acquisition of ligand-independent ESR1 mutations during aromatase inhibitor therapy in metastatic estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer is a common mechanism of hormonal therapy resistance. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that ESR1 mutations can preexist in primary tumors and can be enriched during metastasis. Furthermore, ESR1 mutations express a unique transcriptional profile that favors tumor progression, suggesting that selected ESR1 mutations may influence metastasis. Several groups have used sensitive detection methods using patient liquid biopsies to track ESR1 or truncal somatic mutations to predict treatment outcome and tumor progression, and some of these techniques may eventually be used to guide sequential treatment options in patients. Further development and standardization of mutation tracking in circulating tumor DNA is ongoing. Clinically, patients with ESR1 mutations derive clinical benefit when treated with fulvestrant and CDK4/6-targeted therapies, but the development of more potent selective ER degraders and/or new targeted biotherapies are needed to overcome the endocrine-resistant phenotype of ESR1 mutant-bearing tumors. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of resistance and dissemination of ESR1 mutations as well as the detection methods for ESR1 mutation tracking, newly discovered potential therapeutic targets, and the clinical implications and treatment options for treating patients with ESR1 mutant-bearing tumors.

Update on KMT2B-Related Dystonia.||||||||To summarize the molecular and clinical findings of KMT2B-related dystonia (DYT-KMT2B), a newly identified genetic dystonia syndrome.||||Since first described in 2016, 66 different KMT2B-affecting variants, encompassing a set of frameshift, nonsense, splice-site, missense, and deletion mutations, have been reported in 76 patients. Most mutations are de novo and expected to mediate epigenetic dysregulation by inducing KMT2B haploinsufficiency. DYT-KMT2B is characterized phenotypically by limb-onset childhood dystonia that tends to spread progressively, resulting in generalized dystonia with cranio-cervical involvement. Co-occuring signs such as intellectual disability are frequently observed. Sustained response to deep brain stimulation (DBS), including restoration of independent ambulation, is seen in 93% (27/29) of patients. DYT-KMT2B is emerging as a prevalent monogenic dystonia. Childhood-onset dystonia presentations should prompt a search for KMT2B mutations, preferentially via next-generation-sequencing and genomic-array technologies, to enable specific counseling and treatment. Prospective multicenter studies are desirable to establish KMT2B mutational status as a DBS outcome predictor.

A negative feedback regulatory loop between miR-138 and TP53 is mediated by USP10.||||||||TP53 is a critical tumor suppressor. In approximately 50% of human cancers the TP53 gene is either lost or mutated. The expression level of TP53 in the cells is tightly controlled by a fine-tune machinery, mainly through the Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination pathway. On the other side, the ubiquitinated TP53 could be reversed and stabilized by USP7 and USP10, to keep the amount of TP53 in check. MicroRNAs can negatively regulate TP53 expression levels through direct targeting or positively regulate TP53 function through the repression of negative regulators of TP53. Here we report that microRNA-138 controls TP53 expression by directly targeting USP10. Furthermore, TP53 represses microRNA-138 expression, forming a negative feedback regulatory loop. This finding adds another layer of complexity to the TP53 network.

The Human Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 2 Ion Channel Modulates ROS Through Nrf2.||||||||Transient receptor potential melastatin channel subfamily member 2 (TRPM2) has an essential role in protecting cell viability through modulation of oxidative stress. TRPM2 is highly expressed in cancer. When TRPM2 is inhibited, mitochondria are dysfunctional, ROS levels are increased, and cell viability is reduced. Here, the importance of NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) in TRPM2-mediated suppression of oxidant stress was explored. In TRPM2 depleted cells, antioxidant cofactors glutathione, NADPH, and NADH were significantly reduced. Cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of Nrf2 and of IQGAP1, a modulator of Nrf2 stability regulated by intracellular calcium, were decreased. Antioxidant enzymes transcriptionally regulated by Nrf2 and involved in GSH, NADPH, and NADH generation were significantly lower including PRX1 and PRX3, GPX4, GSTP1, GCLC, and MTHFD2. The glutamine pathway leading to GSH production was suppressed, and ATP and GTP levels were impaired. Reconstitution with wild type TRPM2 or Nrf2, but not TRPM2 pore mutant E960D, rescued expression of enzymes downstream of Nrf2 and restored GSH and GTP. Cell viability, ROS, NADPH, NADH, and ATP levels were fully rescued by TRPM2 and partially by Nrf2. These data show that TRPM2 maintains cell survival following oxidative stress through modulation of antioxidant pathways and cofactors regulated by Nrf2.

Roles of Wnt7a in embryo development, tissue homeostasis, and human diseases.||||||||Human Wnt family comprises 19 proteins which are critical to embryo development and tissue homeostasis. Binding to different frizzled (FZD) receptor, Wnt7a initiates both β-catenin dependent pathway, and β-catenin independent pathways such as PI3K/Akt, RAC/JNK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. In the embryo, Wnt7a plays a crucial role in cerebral cortex development, synapse formation, and central nervous system vasculature formation and maintenance. Wnt7a is also involved in the development of limb and female reproductive system. Wnt7a mutation leads to human limb malformations and animal female reproductive system defects. Wnt7a is implicated in homeostasis maintenance of skeletal muscle, cartilage, cornea and hair follicle, and Wnt7a treatment may be potentially applied in skeletal muscle dystrophy, corneal damage, wound repair, and hair follicle regeneration. Wnt7a plays dual roles in human tumors. Wnt7a is downregulated in lung cancers, functioning as a tumor suppressor, however, it is upregulated in several other malignancies such as ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and glioma, acting as a tumor promoter. Moreover, Wnt7a overexpression is associated with inflammation and fibrosis, but its roles need to be further investigated.

PRDX4 and Its Roles in Various Cancers.||||||||Reactive oxygen species play a vital role in cell survival by regulating physiological metabolism and signal transduction of cells. The imbalance of oxidant and antioxidant states induces oxidative stress within a cell. Redox regulation and oxidative stress are closely related to survival and proliferation of stem cells, cancer cells, and cancer stem cells. Peroxiredoxin 4, a typical endoplasmic reticulum-resident 2-Cys antioxidant of peroxiredoxins, can fine-tune hydrogen peroxide catabolism which affects cell survival by affecting redox balance, oxidative protein folding, and regulation of hydrogen peroxide signaling. Recent studies revealed the overexpression of peroxiredoxin 4 in several kinds of cancers, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer. And it has been demonstrated that peroxiredoxin 4 causally contributes to tumorigenesis, therapeutic resistance, metastasis, and recurrence of tumors. In this article, the characteristics of peroxiredoxin 4 in physiological functions and the cancer-related research progress of mammalian peroxiredoxin 4 is reviewed. We believe that peroxiredoxin 4 has the potential of serving as a novel target for multiple cancers.

Mutations in Plexin D1 have been implicated in pathologic conditions such as truncus arteriosus and Möbius syndrome. Emerging data show that expression of Plexin D1 is deregulated in several cancers; it can support tumor development by aiding in tumor metastasis and EMT; and conversely, it can act as a dependence receptor and stimulate cell death in the absence of its canonical ligand, semaphorin 3E. The role of Plexin D1 in tumor development and progression is thereby garnering research interest for its potential as a biomarker and as a therapeutic target.

GLS2 is protumorigenic in breast cancers.||||||||Many types of cancers have a well-established dependence on glutamine metabolism to support survival and growth, a process linked to glutaminase 1 (GLS) isoforms. Conversely, GLS2 variants often have tumor-suppressing activity. Triple-negative (TN) breast cancer (testing negative for estrogen, progesterone, and Her2 receptors) has elevated GLS protein levels and reportedly depends on exogenous glutamine and GLS activity for survival. Despite having high GLS levels, we verified that several breast cancer cells (including TN cells) express endogenous GLS2, defying its role as a bona fide tumor suppressor. Moreover, ectopic GLS2 expression rescued cell proliferation, TCA anaplerosis, redox balance, and mitochondrial function after GLS inhibition by the small molecule currently in clinical trials CB-839 or GLS knockdown of GLS-dependent cell lines. In several cell lines, GLS2 knockdown decreased cell proliferation and glutamine-linked metabolic phenotypes. Strikingly, long-term treatment of TN cells with another GLS-exclusive inhibitor bis-2'-(5-phenylacetamide-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES) selected for a drug-resistant population with increased endogenous GLS2 and restored proliferative capacity. GLS2 was linked to enhanced in vitro cell migration and invasion, mesenchymal markers (through the ERK-ZEB1-vimentin axis under certain conditions) and in vivo lung metastasis. Of concern, GLS2 amplification or overexpression is linked to an overall, disease-free and distant metastasis-free worse survival prognosis in breast cancer. Altogether, these data establish an unforeseen role of GLS2 in sustaining tumor proliferation and underlying metastasis in breast cancer and provide an initial framework for exploring GLS2 as a novel therapeutic target.

Silencing of GSTM3 with GSTM3 siRNA decreased the proliferation, migration and invasion but increased the apoptosis of glioma cell lines U251 and U87, which was similar to that the effect lncRNA GAS5 over-expression.||||lncRNA GAS5 can effectively inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells and promote cell apoptosis through targeting GSTM3 expression.

Monogenic Forms of Diabetes Mellitus.||||||||In addition to the common types of diabetes mellitus, two major monogenic diabetes forms exist. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) represents a heterogenous group of monogenic, autosomal dominant diseases. MODY accounts for 1-2% of all diabetes cases, and it is not just underdiagnosed but often misdiagnosed to type 1 or type 2 diabetes. More than a dozen MODY genes have been identified to date, and their molecular classification is of great importance in the correct treatment decision and in the judgment of the prognosis. The most prevalent subtypes are HNF1A, GCK, and HNF4A. Genetic testing for MODY has changed recently due to the technological advancements, as contrary to the sequential testing performed in the past, nowadays all MODY genes can be tested simultaneously by next-generation sequencing. The other major group of monogenic diabetes is neonatal diabetes mellitus which can be transient or permanent, and often the diabetes is a part of a syndrome. It is a severe monogenic disease appearing in the first 6 months of life. The hyperglycemia usually requires insulin. There are two forms, permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) and transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM). In TNDM, the diabetes usually reverts within several months but might relapse later in life. The incidence of NDM is 1:100,000-1:400,000 live births, and PNDM accounts for half of the cases. Most commonly, neonatal diabetes is caused by mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes encoding the ATP-dependent potassium channel of the β cell. Neonatal diabetes has experienced a quick and successful transition into the clinical practice since the discovery of the molecular background. In case of both genetic diabetes groups, recent guidelines recommend genetic testing.

Immunohistochemical expression of HIK1083 and MUC6 in endometrial carcinomas.||||||||Gastric-type endocervical adenocarcinoma (EA) is characterised by aggressive behaviour and pathogenesis independent of human papillomavirus infection. Because of its morphology and frequent mutation-pattern expression of p53, gastric-type EA may be confused with several types of endometrial carcinoma, particularly in biopsy and curettage specimens. HIK1083 and MUC6 are immunohistochemical markers used to support a diagnosis of gastric-type EA; however, the rates of expression of these markers in endometrial tumours are largely unknown. We therefore aimed to assess the expression of HIK1083 and MUC6 in a cohort of different types of endometrial carcinoma.||||Ninety-one endometrial carcinomas (56 endometrioid, 16 clear cell, and 19 serous) from 91 patients treated with hysterectomy were included. A representative tumour block from each case was used for immunohistochemical staining with HIK1083 and MUC6. The percentage of stained cells (0-100%) and average staining intensity (weak, moderate, and strong) were recorded for both markers. None of 91 cases expressed HIK1083. In contrast, 66% (60/91) of cases showed at least focal expression of MUC6; importantly, 54 of 60 (90%) positive cases showed moderate or strong staining. Five of 60 (8%) cases showed MUC6 staining in ≥50% of tumour cells. Endometrioid tumours (49/56, 88%) were more likely to express MUC6 than cases of clear cell (1/16, 6%) or serous (10/19, 53%) carcinoma.||||Endometrial carcinoma often expresses MUC6. In contrast, HIK1083 is consistently negative, and thus, when positive, is a more reliable marker for distinguishing gastric-type EA from some of its endometrial mimics.

DEGS1 variant causes neurological disorder.||||||||Sphingolipidoses are monogenic lipid storage diseases caused by variants in enzymes of lipid synthesis and metabolism. We describe an autosomal recessive complex neurological disorder affecting consanguineous kindred. All four affected individuals, born at term following normal pregnancies, had mild to severe intellectual disability, spastic quadriplegia, scoliosis and epilepsy in most, with no dysmorphic features. Brain MRI findings were suggestive of leukodystrophy, with abnormal hyperintense signal in the periventricular perioccipital region and thinning of the body of corpus callosum. Notably, all affected individuals were asymptomatic at early infancy and developed normally until the age of 8-18 months, when deterioration ensued. Homozygosity mapping identified a single 8.7 Mb disease-associated locus on chromosome 1q41-1q42.13 between rs1511695 and rs537250 (two-point LOD score 2.1). Whole exome sequencing, validated through Sanger sequencing, identified within this locus a single disease-associated homozygous variant in DEGS1, encoding C4-dihydroceramide desaturase, an enzyme of the ceramide synthesis pathway. The missense variant, segregating within the family as expected for recessive heredity, affects an evolutionary-conserved amino acid of all isoforms of DEGS1 (c.656A>G, c.764A>G; p.(N219S), p.(N255S)) and was not found in a homozygous state in ExAC and gnomAD databases or in 300 ethnically matched individuals. Lipidomcs analysis of whole blood of affected individuals demonstrated augmented levels of dihydroceramides, dihydrosphingosine, dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate and dihydrosphingomyelins with reduced levels of ceramide, sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate and monohexosylceramides, as expected in malfunction of C4-dihydroceramide desaturase. Thus, we describe a sphingolipidosis causing a severe regressive neurological disease.

Retinol dehydrogenase 10 promotes metastasis of glioma cells via the transforming growth factor-β/SMAD signaling pathway.||||||||Glioma is the most common primary malignant tumor in the central nervous system. Because of the resistance of glioma to chemoradiotherapy and its aggressive growth, the survival rate of patients with glioma has not improved. This study aimed to disclose the effect of retinol dehydrogenase 10 (RDH10) on the migration and invasion of glioma cells, and to explore the potential mechanism.||||Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine the expression levels of RDH10 in healthy glial cells and glioma cells. Human glioma cell strains, U87 and U251, were infected with negative control or RDH10-interfering lentiviruses. RT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to determine the knockdown efficiency. Scratch and transwell assays were used to assess cell migration and invasion after RDH10 knockdown. Finally, changes in transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/SMAD signaling pathway-related expression were examined by Western blotting. Differences between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance.||||RDH10 was highly expressed in glioma cells. Compared with the control group, RDH10 knockdown significantly reduced RDH10 messenger RNA and protein expression levels in U87 and U251 glioma cells (U87: 1.00 ± 0.08 vs. 0.22 ± 0.02, t = 16.55, P < 0.001; U251: 1.00 ± 0.17 vs. 0.39 ± 0.01, t = 6.30, P < 0.001).

The Interplay of MicroRNA-34a, LGR4, EMT-Associated Factors, and MMP2 in Regulating Uveal Melanoma Cells.||||||||MicroRNA-34a (miR-34a) has been implicated in many biological processes. It is downregulated in uveal melanoma, and introduction of miR-34a inhibits the proliferation and migration of uveal melanoma cells. Leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 4 (LGR4) is a novel target of miR-34a identified first in retinal pigment epithelial cells. In this study, we sought to evaluate the interaction of miR-34a and LGR4 in uveal melanoma and its downstream mechanisms.||||The expression of LGR4, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated factors, and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) in uveal melanoma cells was assessed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis. MicroRNA-34a mimic molecules, LGR4 small interfering RNA (siRNA), or MMP2-specific siRNA were transiently transfected into uveal melanoma cells. In vitro scratch and Transwell assays were used to evaluate the migratory and invasive potential of the resultant uveal melanoma cells.||||LGR4 is upregulated in uveal melanoma cells. Introduction of miR-34a significantly decreased the expression level of LGR4. Transfection with miR-34a or knockdown of LGR4 attenuated the aggressiveness of uveal melanoma cells. In addition, there was a decrease in the expression of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, vimentin, and Snail following miR-34a introduction or knockdown of LGR4. Finally, MMP2 was found to be a downstream effector for miR-34a and LGR4 that regulates the migration and invasion of uveal melanoma cells.||||MicroRNA-34a negatively controls LGR4, thereby inhibiting the migration and invasion of uveal melanoma cells. Ultimately, both miR-34a and LGR4 impact the aggressiveness of uveal melanoma with alterations in the markers of the EMT. MMP2 is a downstream effector that influences the metastasis seen with uveal melanoma cells.

Connexin43 as a Tumor Suppressor: Proposed Connexin43 mRNA-circularRNAs-microRNAs Axis Towards Prevention and Early Detection in Breast Cancer.||||||||Breast cancer (BC) is a global public health burden, constituting the highest cancer incidence in women worldwide. Connexin43 (Cx43) is a member of a family of transmembrane proteins responsible in part for intercellular communication between adjacent breast epithelial cells, via gap junctions. Cx43 plays key role in mammary gland development and differentiation and its spatio-temporal perturbation contributes to tumorigenesis. Thus, Cx43 acts as a breast tumor-suppressor. Signaling pathways and phenotypes downstream of Cx43 mRNA loss/mis-localization in breast cells have been well-studied. However, axes parallel to Cx43 loss are less understood. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous non-coding RNAs that repress translation and circularRNAs (circRNAs) are a class of endogenous RNAs that originate from RNA splicing and act as miRNA "sponges". CircRNAs and miRNAs are dysregulated in cancers and are highly abundant and stable in the circulation. Thus, they present as attractive liquid biopsy cancer biomarkers. Here, an axis for Cx43 mRNA-circRNAs-miRNAs interactions along BC initiation (denoted by loss of breast epithelial polarity and development of hyperplastic phenotypes) is proposed to potentially serve as a signature biomarker toward BC early-onset detection and prevention.

ANGPTL6-mediated angiogenesis promotes alpha fetoprotein-producing gastric cancer progression.||||||||Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing gastric cancer (AFPGC) is regarded as a rare but highly malignant gastric adenocarcinoma subtype and its clinic pathological presentation mimics hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the underlying mechanism of this disease remains elusive. The level of ANGPTL6 in AFPGC cell lines is much higher than that of common types of gastric cancer cells. A high level of ANGPTL6 confers a poor prognosis and is correlated with the expression of CD34 (an endothelial cell marker). ANGPTL6 promotes endothelial cell migration and tube formation, Moreover, ANGPTL6 knockdown inhibits cancer cell apoptosis and invasiveness. Mechanistically, ANGPTL6 activates the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways. Treatment of ERK1/2 or AKT inhibitor can attenuated cell migration and tube formation. ANGPTL6 loss results in tumor growth in vivo.

Overexpression of SOX4 has been shown to play important roles in multiple cancers including PCa. However, the link between these two critical genetic aberrations is unclear. In the current study, we showed that C-MYC was overexpressed in 16.2% (17/105) of Chinese patients with localized PCa. Overexpression of C-MYC was significantly associated with high Gleason scores (P = 0.012) and high Ki67 labeling index (P = 0.005). C-MYC overexpression was correlated with cancer-related mortality and suggested to be an unfavorable prognostic factor in Chinese PCa patients (P = 0.018). Overexpression of C-MYC is associated with SOX4 overexpression in PCa tissues. Notably, SOX4 is a direct target gene of C-MYC; C-MYC activates SOX4 expression via binding to its promoter. In addition, Co-IP analysis demonstrated a physical interaction between C-MYC and SOX4 protein in PCa cells. Clinically, C-MYC+/SOX4+ characterized poor prognosis in a subset of PCa patients. In total, C-MYC overexpression may contribute to PCa progression by activating SOX4. Our findings highlight an important role of C-MYC/SOX4 in PCa progression in a subset of PCa patients.

Data from TCGAportal and FIREBROWSE indicated that SPC25 was upregulated in BC tissues compared to normal tissues, and CANCERTOOL indicated that higher SPC25 mRNA levels were associated with increased probability of recurrence and poorer survival in BC patients. BC patients with higher SPC25 expression displayed shorter distant metastasis-free survival, relapse-free survival, and overall survival. Colony formation and CCK-8 experiments confirmed that SPC25 promoted proliferation of BC cells. Single-cell analysis indicated that SPC25 is associated with cell cycle regulation, DNA damage and repair, and BC cell proliferation. SPC25 knockdown suppressed proliferation of BC cells. MiRNAs, circRNAs, RNA-binding proteins, transcription factors, and immune factors that might interact with SPC25 mRNA to promote BC were also identified. These findings suggest that SPC25 levels are higher in more malignant BC subtypes and are associated with poor prognosis in BC patients. In addition, DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and transcription factors inhibitor treatments targeting SPC25 might improve survival in BC patients.

There are, however, several lines of evidence associating estrogens with mammary carcinogenesis. A marked individual genetic variability concerning estrogens biosynthesis, metabolism and mechanism of action was recognized and associated with human breast cancer susceptibility, clinical features and progression. Although some genetic variations in canine ESR1 gene were reported, their influence in clinicopathological features and progression of canine mammary tumors has not been fully evaluated. This study aims to assess the influence of SNPs in ESR1 gene (rs397512133, rs397510462, rs851327560, rs397510612, rs852887655, rs852684753 and rs852398698) in canine mammary tumors characteristics and progression.

The Antitumoral Effect of the S-Adenosylhomocysteine Hydrolase Inhibitor, 3-Deazaneplanocin A, is Independent of EZH2 but is Correlated with EGFR Downregulation in Chondrosarcomas.||||||||3-Deazaneplanocin, DZNep, has been reported to inhibit the EZH2 histone methylase and to induce cell apoptosis in chondrosarcomas (CS). The present study aims to confirm the therapeutic potential of EZH2 inhibitors and investigate the molecular mechanisms of DZNep in chondrosarcomas.||||CS cell lines and primary cultures were used. Apoptosis was investigated using PARP cleavage, caspase 3/7 activity, or Apo2.7 expression. S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) were quantified by UHPLC-MS/MS. Differentially expressed genes in treated-chondrosarcomas and chondrocytes were researched by microarray analysis.||||DZNep induced apoptosis in chondrosarcomas both in vivo and in vitro. However, this effect was not correlated to EZH2 expression nor activity, and EZH2 knock-down by siRNA did not reduce CS viability. Additionally, the reduction of H3K27me3 induced by GSK126 or tazemetostat (EPZ-6438) did not provoke chondrosarcoma death. However, as expected, DZNep induced SAH accumulation and reduced SAM:SAH ratio. Further, microarray analysis suggests a key role of EGFR in antitumoral effect of DZNep, and pharmacological inhibition of EGFR reduced chondrosarcoma survival.||||EZH2 is not an adequate target for chondrosarcoma treatment. However, DZNep induces apoptosis in chondrosarcomas in vitro and in vivo, by a mechanism likely mediated though EGFR expression. Consequently, it would be worth initiating clinical trials to evaluating efficiency to S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase or EGFR inhibitors in patients with chondrosarcomas.

GRK2 promotes growth of medulloblastoma cells and protects them from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.||||||||G-protein coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2; ADRBK1, BARK1) is most known as a regulator of G-protein coupled receptors. However, GRK2 also has other functions. Medulloblastomas are the most common malignant brain cancers in children. GRK2 has not been implicated in medulloblastoma biology. Here we report that GRK2 knockdown slowed cell growth, diminished proliferation, and enhanced cisplatin- and etoposide-induced apoptosis in medulloblastoma cell lines UW228-2 and Daoy. Reciprocally, GRK2 overexpression attenuated apoptosis induced by these chemotherapy drugs. Cisplatin and etoposide increased phosphorylation of AKT (S473) and GRK2 knockdown mitigated this increase. Cisplatin and etoposide attenuated ERK phosphorylation, but GRK2 knockdown did not alter this effect. Wildtype GRK2 reversed the increase in cisplatin- and etoposide-induced apoptosis caused by GRK2 knockdown. GRK2-K220R (kinase dead) and GRK2-S670A (unphosphorylated, constitutively active) conferred protection from cisplatin that was similar to wildtype GRK2, suggesting that this protection may be mediated though a kinase-independent activity of GRK2. These data demonstrate that GRK2 contributes to proliferation and survival of these medulloblastoma cell lines and to their protection from cisplatin- and etoposide-induced apoptosis.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) has a beneficial effect on glucose homeostasis, reduces the risk of new-onset T2DM and improves glucose control in women with T2DM. T2DM has been considered a cardiovascular disease equivalent, which meant that postmenopausal women with the disease could not take MHT but current evidence supports an individualised approach to this issue. Therapeutic strategies for women with T2DM after menopause should aim to maximise benefits for metabolic, cardiovascular and bone health with the minimum of adverse effects, bearing in mind that most women will spend more than one-third of their life being of postmenopausal status.

Long noncoding RNA CPS1-IT1 suppresses melanoma cell metastasis through inhibiting Cyr61 via competitively binding to BRG1.||||||||Long noncoding RNA CPS1-IT1 is recently recognized as a tumor suppressor in several cancers. Here, we investigate the role of CPS1-IT1 in human melanoma. Presently, our study reveals the low expression of CPS1-IT1 in human melanoma tissues and cell lines, which is significantly associated with metastasis and tumor stage. Besides, the potential of CPS1-IT1 as a prognosis-predictor is strongly indicated. Functionally, CPS1-IT1 overexpression inhibits cell migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis in melanoma cells. CYR61, an angiogenic factor that participates in tumor metastasis as well as a recognized oncogene in melanoma, is shown to be confined under CPS1-IT1 overexpression in melanoma cells. Furthermore, enforced expression of Cyr61 in CPS1-IT1-silenced melanoma cells dramatically normalized the protein level of Cyr61 and that of its downstream targets vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-9, as well as the repressive effect of CPS1-IT1 overexpression on melanoma cell metastasis. BRG1, a core component of SWI/SNF complex, is implied to interact with both CPS1-IT1 and Cyr61 in melanoma cells. Moreover, CPS1-IT1 negatively regulates Cyr61 expression by blocking the binding of BRG1 to Cyr61 promoter. Jointly, CPS1-IT1 controls melanoma metastasis through impairing Cyr61 expression via competitively binding with BRG1, uncovering a novel potential therapeutic and prognostic biomarker for patients with melanoma.

Bone marrow transplantation experiments revealed that Gadd45β functions predominantly in the intestinal epithelium and is critical during the recovery phase. Gadd45β regulates the TGF-β signaling pathway in colon tissue and epithelial cells by inhibiting Smurf-mediated degradation of TGF-β receptor type 1 via competitive binding to the N-terminal domain of Smad7. Furthermore, these results indicate that the Gadd45β-regulated TGF-β signaling pathway is involved in wound healing by enhancing epithelial restitution.

Discovery of a role of the novel hepatokine, hepassocin, in obesity.||||||||Obesity is a public health problem that has raised concerns worldwide and is often associated with hepatic steatosis. Hepassocin is a novel hepatokine that causes hepatic steatosis and induces insulin resistance (IR). However, the role of hepassocin in obesity remains obscure. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between hepassocin levels and obesity. In total, 371 subjects who had a normal weight (NW), were overweight, or were obese were enrolled. We found that hepassocin levels in subjects who were overweight (6,705 ± 1,707 pg/ml) or obese (7,335 ± 2,077 pg/ml) were significantly higher than those of subjects with a NW (5,767 ± 1,500 pg/ml) (p < .001, test for trend). A multiple linear regression analysis showed that the body-mass index, waist circumference, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and homeostatic model assessment of IR were independently associated with hepassocin after adjusting for age, sex, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, log triglycerides, alanine transaminase, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate. This study provides evidence that subjects who were overweight or obese had significantly higher hepassocin levels than those with a NW.

Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), WB and immunoprecipitation (IP) assay were utilized to explore the potential downstream signaling pathway and molecule mechanism of PKP2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).||||Analysis of PKP2 expression and clinicopathological parameters reveals a significant correlation of PKP2 expression with gender (n = 1020, P < 0.001) and histological type (n = 1020, P < 0.001). Subsequently, our results demonstrated that high PKP2 expression is not associated with poor survival in different gender of lung cancer patients, and is an unfavorable and independent prognostic biomarker for LUAD patients, but not for LUSC patients. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that PKP2 expression is positively associated with EGFR signaling in LUAD. Further, in vitro and in vivo assays revealed that PKP2 promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion through activating EGFR signaling pathway in LUAD cells.||||Our study provides the basis for further investigation of the function and molecular mechanism by which upregulation of PKP2 promotes the development and progression of LUAD. PKP2 may serve as a potential target for anticancer therapies.

An update on genetic frontotemporal dementia.||||||||Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a highly heritable group of neurodegenerative disorders, with around 30% of patients having a strong family history. The majority of that heritability is accounted for by autosomal dominant mutations in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72), progranulin (GRN), and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) genes, with mutations more rarely seen in a number of other genes. This review will discuss the recent updates in the field of genetic FTD. Age at symptom onset in genetic FTD is variable with recently identified genetic modifiers including TMEM106B (in GRN carriers particularly) and a polymorphism at a locus containing two overlapping genes LOC101929163 and C6orf10 (in C9orf72 carriers). Behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD) is the most common diagnosis in each of the genetic groups, although in C9orf72 carriers amyotrophic lateral sclerosis either alone, or with bvFTD, is also common. An atypical neuropsychiatric presentation is also seen in C9orf72 carriers and family members of carriers are at greater risk of psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and autistic spectrum disorders. Large natural history studies of presymptomatic genetic FTD are now underway both in Europe/Canada (GENFI-the Genetic FTD Initiative) and in the US (ARTFL/LEFFTDS study), collaborating together under the banner of the FTD Prevention Initiative (FPI). These studies are taking forward the validation of cognitive, imaging and fluid biomarkers that aim to robustly measure disease onset, staging and progression in genetic FTD. Grey matter changes on MRI and hypometabolism on FDG-PET are seen at least 10 years before symptom onset with white matter abnormalities seen earlier, but the pattern and exact timing of changes differ between different genetic groups. In contrast, tau PET has yet to show promise in genetic FTD. Three key fluid biomarkers have been identified so far that are likely to be helpful in clinical trials-CSF or blood neurofilament light chain levels (in all groups), CSF or blood progranulin levels (in GRN carriers) and CSF poly(GP) dipeptide repeat protein levels (in C9orf72 carriers). Increased knowledge about genetic FTD has led to more clinical presymptomatic genetic testing but this has not yet been mirrored in the development of either an accepted FTD-specific testing protocol or provision of appropriate psychological support mechanisms for those living through the at-risk phase. This will become even more relevant as disease-modifying therapy trials start in each of the genetic groups over the next few years.

Phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein-4 (PEBP4) is increased in IgA nephropathy and is associated with IgA-positive B-cells in affected kidneys.||||||||IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common glomerulonephritis worldwide and a major cause of chronic kidney disease and failure. IgAN is driven by an autoimmune reaction against galactose-deficient IgA1 that results in the generation of autoantibodies and large IgG-IgA immune complexes. Immune complexes accumulate in the glomerular mesangium causing chronic inflammation and renal scarring. A significant proportion of IgAN patients develop end-stage kidney disease and require dialysis or transplantation. Currently, there are no approved specific therapies that can ameliorate the systemic autoimmune reaction in IgAN and no biomarkers that can predict renal inflammation and scarring. In this study, we used shotgun LC-MS/MS proteomics to compare small volumes of urine from healthy subjects and IgAN patients. We identified multiple urine proteins with unknown renal or IgAN function. Our attention was captured by the increase of phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein-4 (PEBP4) in IgAN urine. The function of PEBP4 in IgAN or renal disease is unknown. Increased levels of urine and serum PEBP4 were subsequently validated in different cohorts of IgAN patients and PEBP4 was linked to declining kidney function in IgAN. Strong PEBP4 staining was sporadically seen in IgAN kidney biopsies, colocalising with IgA in glomeruli and in the lumen of kidney tubules. In a small number of IgAN biopsies, PEBP4 colocalised with IgA and CD19 while the increased excretion of PEBP4 in IgAN urine was accompanied by increased excretion of classic B-cell factors BAFF, BCMA and TACI as well as IgA and IgG. PEBP4 is a new IgAN-related protein with unknown function and a likely renal disease marker in urine and serum.

It functions as a transcriptional corepressor and is widely used as a biomarker of synovial sarcoma (SS). Within the skin, atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX) and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) often enter the histopathologic differential diagnosis. TLE1 expression has not been evaluated in these neoplasms. We examined archived tissues sections from the surgical pathology files from 10 adult patients diagnosed with AFX and 10 adult patients diagnosed with DFSP. We found nuclear staining in 10 of 10 AFX and 2 of 10 DFSP. We also noticed three patterns of staining in AFX: predominantly spindle component, predominantly epithelioid component, or mixed pattern of both epithelioid and spindle components. The group with the predominantly spindle pattern expressed the strongest nuclear TLE1 staining. In the DFSP group, one lesion demonstrated staining of epithelioid cells, with strong, diffuse nuclear TLE 1 expression, and the second lesion stained only the spindled cells, with weak nuclear TLE1 marking. In conclusion, TLE1, while a sensitive marker for SS, is not specific. A wide range of cutaneous spindle cell neoplasms also express TLE1. AFX and DFSP should be added to this list. TLE1 might be added to a diagnostic panel in this differential diagnosis.

Methods TCGA database was utilized to analyze the expression changes of RAD51 in gliomas. RAD51 was over-expressed or knocked down in U251 glioma cells via lentivirus infection, or its activity was inhibited by small molecule inhibitors. Cell proliferation and migration ability were examined by CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, and scratch wound-healing assay; CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry were performed to assess the effect of RAD51 on the sensitivity of glioma cells upon the treatment of temozolomide. Western blotting was used to determine the alteration of P53. Results The expression of RAD51 significantly increased in glioma tissues. RAD51 enhanced the proliferation and migration ability of U251 glioma cells; knockdown of RAD51 enhanced the sensitivity of U251 glioma cells to temozolomide. Over-expression of RAD51 increased the expression of P53, whereas knockdown of RAD51 decreased the expression of P53. Conclusion RAD51 plays an oncogene function in glioma cells. RAD51 over-expression enhances the proliferation and migration of glioma cells. RAD51 knockdown increases the sensitivity of glioma cells to temozolomide.

Suppression of FOXM1 activities and breast cancer growth in vitro and in vivo by a new class of compounds.||||||||The transcription factor FOXM1 is upregulated and overexpressed in aggressive, therapy-resistant forms of hormone receptor-positive and triple negative breast cancers, and is associated with less good patient survival. FOXM1 signaling is also a key driver in many other cancers. Here, we identify a new class of compounds effective in suppressing FOXM1 activity in breast cancers, and displaying good potency for antitumor efficacy. The compounds bind directly to FOXM1 and alter its proteolytic sensitivity, reduce the cellular level of FOXM1 protein by a proteasome- dependent process, and suppress breast cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and increase apoptosis. RNA-seq and gene set enrichment analyses indicate that the compounds decrease expression of FOXM1-regulated genes and suppress gene ontologies under FOXM1 regulation. Several compounds have favorable pharmacokinetic properties and show good tumor suppression in preclinical breast tumor models. These compounds may be suitable for further clinical evaluation in targeting aggressive breast cancers driven by FOXM1.

Phosphorylated Rasal2 facilitates breast cancer progression.||||||||Rasal2 has diametric effects on progression of oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and -negative (ER-) breast cancers. The relevant causes are unknown. It is also unknown whether the effects of Rasal2 are mediated by an exosome-transport process.||||Exosomes were purified from breast cancer cells and identified by transmission electron microscopy and flow cytometry analysis. In vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted to investigate the role of Rasal2 in exosome-mediated breast cancer progression. Western blot analysis was performed to detect Rasal2 and p-Rasal2 (phosphorylated Rasal2) expression in ER+/ER- breast cancer cells and in exosomes, cancer tissues and blood of patients with ER+ or ER- breast cancer.||||Phosphorylation of Rasal2 at Serine 237 promoted tumour growth in both ER+ and ER- tumour cells and tissues. The functions of both p-Rasal2 and non-p-Rasal2 (non-phosphorylated-Rasal2) in the modulation of breast cancer progression are exosome-mediated. p-Rasal2 expression in ER+ breast cancer cells and exosomes, cancer tissues and blood was significantly lower than in ER- tumour cells and patients.||||p-Rasal2 facilitates tumour progression in both ER+ and ER- breast cancers. The ratio of p-Rasal2/non-p-Rasal2 in ER+ and ER- breast cancers is one of the factors deciding the role of Rasal2 (or total Rasal2) as a suppressor in ER+ breast cancers or as a promoter in ER- breast cancers. Targeting the phosphorylation of Rasal2 machinery may therefore be useful as a therapy to restrain breast cancer progression by reducing p-Rasal2/non-p-Rasal2 ratio, especially in ER- breast cancers.

PPARγ inhibits breast cancer progression by upregulating PTPRF expression.||||||||Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) regulates fatty acid storage and glucose metabolism. Recently, PPARγ has been reported to be involved in cancer. The present study reported a PPARγ consensus binding site (AGGTCA) in the ptprf promoter and identified a strong association between PPARγ and PTPRF expression, as well as their tumor suppressor roles in a v-Ha-Ras-induced model of breast cancer.||||The prognostic potential of PPARγ was assessed with a KM analysis of raw data from 3,951 breast cancer patients. The expression of PPARγ and PTPRF in the rat breast cancer cell lines was detected by Western blot and qPCR. The impact of PPARγ on cancer cell migration, invasion, and growth was confirmed using cell migration assay, transwell cell invasion assay, tri-dimensional soft agar culture, respectively. The binding of PPARγ with the ptprf promoter was then examined using electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The inhibitory effect of PPARγ on tumor growth was then examined in mouse tumor model in vivo.||||It was identified that PPARγ expression is lost in the aggressive v-Ha-Ras-induced breast cancer cell line FE1.2 but highly expressed in less malignant FE1.3 cells. Exogenous expression of PPARγ in FE1.2 cells (FE1.2-PPARγhi) resulted in a marked inhibition of proliferation compared with that in FE1.2-Vector control group. FE1.2-PPARγhi cells also exhibited reduced migration, invasion, and colony formation abilities compared with those of the controls. The PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone also suppressed the malignant properties of FE1.2 cells. Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor F (PTPRF), a downstream target of PPARγ, was markedly induced in FE1.2-PPARγhi cells. A PPARγ consensus binding site (AGGTCA) was identified in the ptprf promoter, and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed that PPARγ bind to this promoter. Similar to the effect of vector-mediated overexpression of PPARγ, ectopic overexpression of PTPRF in FE1.2 cells led to reduced proliferation. Furthermore, a PPARγ antagonist (GW9662) and PTP inhibitor (NSC87877) abrogated the suppressive function of PPARγ and PTPRF in FE1.2 cells, respectively. PPARγ overexpression or activation suppressed the progression and distant organ metastasis of breast cancer cells in a NOD/SCID mouse model.||||These results suggest that PPARγ inhibits tumor cell proliferation, at least in part, through direct regulation of the ptprf gene and that PPARγ is a potential target for breast cancer treatment.

Here, we examined whether clusterin had protective effects against hepatic fibrosis using in vitro and in vivo models. Clusterin was upregulated in the livers of human cirrhotic patients and in thioacetamide (TAA)-induced and bile duct ligation mouse models of liver fibrosis.

Patients with recent ACS (969 total) were divided into four groups according to depression comorbidity at baseline and treatment allocation: 591, absent depression; 127, depression on escitalopram; 128, depression on placebo; 123, depression on care as usual (CAU). BDNF methylation was measured in leucocyte DNA, and multiple demographic and clinical characteristics including interleukin 6 were evaluated as covariates at baseline. The primary outcome, time to first MACE (a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction and percutaneous coronary intervention), was investigated using Cox regression models after adjustment for covariates. Interleukin 6 level was significantly higher in patients with higher BDNF methylation values. Higher BDNF methylation was associated with increased MACE independent of confounding factors [HR (95% CI) = 1.45 (1.17-1.78)]. This association was significant in patients without depression [HR (95% CI) = 1.39 (1.01-1.90)] and depressive patients on placebo [HR (95% CI) = 1.72 (1.02-3.02)] or CAU [HR (95% CI) = 1.53 (1.01-2.61)], but not in those treated with escitalopram [HR (95% CI) = 1.00 (0.51-1.95)].||||BDNF methylation was significantly associated with prognosis of ACS. Escitalopram may mitigate the deleterious effect of higher BDNF methylation in depressive patients with ACS. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanistics and to assess the generalisability of these findings.

Cas9-edited immune checkpoint blockade PD-1 DNA polyaptamer hydrogel for cancer immunotherapy.||||||||Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been widely studied in immunotherapy. Although antibodies have been more widely used to block immune checkpoints, DNA aptamers have unique advantages for this purpose. Here, we designed a DNA polyaptamer hydrogel that can be precisely cut by Cas9/sgRNA for programmed release of an immune checkpoint-blocking DNA aptamer. As a representative immune checkpoint inhibitor, we used a PD-1 DNA aptamer. Rolling-circle amplification was used to generate a hydrogel comprising DNA with PD-1 aptamer and an sgRNA-targeting sequence. When mixed with Cas9/sgRNA, the PD-1 DNA aptamer hydrogel (PAH) lost its gel property and liberated the PD-1 aptamer sequence. The precise Cas9/sgRNA-mediated release of the PD-1 DNA aptamer, which was confirmed by gel electrophoresis, was found to effectively activate the cytokine-secretion function of splenocytes. In vivo, molecular imaging revealed that PD-1 DNA polyaptamer hydrogel co-injected with Cas9/sgRNA (Cas9/PAH) remained at the injection site longer than free aptamer and yielded significantly higher antitumor effects and survival than hydrogel or free aptamer. Moreover, increased immune cell filtration was observed at tumor tissues treated with Cas9/PAH. These results suggest that our Cas9/sgRNA-edited immune checkpoint-blocking aptamer hydrogel has strong potential for anticancer immunotherapy.

Circulating cytokines predict severity of rheumatic heart disease.||||||||Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is associated with inflammation that damages cardiac valves, often requiring surgical interventions. The underlying mechanisms involved in the disease progression are not completely understood. This study aimed to evaluate cytokine plasma levels in patients with RHD as possible markers of disease severity.||||Eighty-nine patients with RHD, age of 41 years ±11.5 years, were prospectively enrolled. RHD severity was defined as valve dysfunction that required invasive intervention, either valve repair or replacement. Peripheral blood samples were collected from all patients for cytokine measurements. The patients were followed up to look at adverse clinical events defined as either the need for valve intervention or death. At baseline, 64 (71.9%) patients had previously undergone valve intervention, whereas 25 patients had stable clinical presentation. Patients with severe RHD displayed higher levels of inflammatory cytokines than patients with stable disease. Cluster analysis showed segregation of severe and stable RHD based on IL-6/TNF-α and IL-6/IL-17A, respectively. IL-6 and TNF-α expression were positively correlated in severe but not in stable RHD patients. During a median follow-up of 23 months, 16 patients (18%) had an adverse outcome. IL-10 at baseline (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.08-1.43, p = 0.003), and IL-4 (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.24, p = 0.041) were predictors of events during the follow-up.||||High levels of cytokines are associated with severity of RHD. The co-regulated expression of IL-6 and TNF-α is associated with severe valve dysfunction, whereas high IL-10 and IL-4 levels predicted subsequently adverse outcome.

Proximity ligation assay (PLA) was used to detect interactions of M2 and M3 with endocytotic regulators (Cav-1, clathrin, Rab7, and Rab11) by Cy3 labeling. Analyses of three-dimensional (3D)-reconstructed z-stacks (63 ×  Oil 1.4) were done with Huygens software. We determined the object density for quantification and assessed membrane localization.||||Receptor/protein complexes were detected as well-demarcated 3D objects. Interactions of M2 with Cav-1, clathrin, Rab11, and Rab7 were significantly increased in IC/BPS. M3/clathrin and M3/Rab11 complexes were higher in IC/BPS, while M3/Cav-1 and M3/Rab7 were not. A significant shift of complexes from the membrane to cytoplasm was observed in conjunction with increased internalization via clathrin vesicles or caveolae in IC/BPS.||||High numbers of M3/clathrin and M3/Rab11 complexes reflect the well-documented clathrin-mediated desensitization of M3 and speak in favor with enhanced receptor protein expression in IC/BPS. Increased amounts of M2/Cav-1, M2/clathrin, and M2/Rab11 complexes represent altered M2 internalization and recycling leading to high abundance in IC/BPS. In this regard, caveolae-localized M2 could be possibly associated with the activation of nitric oxide (NO) synthase and NO production.

Therefore, epithelial-derived mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-25, IL-33, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and ezrin, may play a role as alarmins in IL-4/IL-13 signaling in allergic asthma (AA). We investigated the serum levels of IL-25, IL-33, TSLP, ezrin, IL-4 and IL-13, after bronchial challenge with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus in patients with AA. We examined 18 subjects: nine steroid-free stable patients with AA sensitized to D. pteronyssinus and nine non-atopic healthy subjects (HS). Bronchial allergen challenge was performed using inhaled D. pteronyssinus allergen. IL-4, IL-13, IL-25, IL-33, TSLP and ezrin levels in serum were measured by ELISA at two time points - before and 24 hours after bronchial allergen challenge. The serum levels of IL-25, TSLP and ezrin did not differ between AA and HS groups at baseline. However, after allergen exposure, significant increases in serum levels of IL-25, TSLP and ezrin were observed only in patients with AA. The serum level of IL-33 at baseline was significantly higher in the AA group compared with HS, but the allergen challenge did not provoke an increase of this cytokine in any group. IL-4 and IL-13 levels were significantly higher at baseline in the AA group compared with HS and, after allergen exposure, were significantly increased in the AA group, with no effect on HS. Thus, the epithelial-derived mediators IL-25, TSLP and ezrin, via IL4/IL13 signaling, enhance type 2 inflammation after bronchial challenge with D. pteronyssinus in AA.

Three variants recurred in more than one case; one was detected in five seemingly unrelated families. The detection rate for all breast cancer cases was 4%, 5% in bilateral breast cancer cases and 3% if breast cancer was diagnosed < 40 years. Of patients with ovarian cancer, 12/38 (32%) were carriers; the detection rate reached 75% (3/4) among patients diagnosed with both breast and ovarian cancer.||||The overall yield of comprehensive BRCA1/2 testing in high-risk Israeli Arab individuals is low in breast cancer patients, and much higher in ovarian cancer patients.

Gossypol Suppresses Growth of Temozolomide-Resistant Glioblastoma Tumor Spheres.||||||||Temozolomide is the current first-line treatment for glioblastoma patients but, because many patients are resistant to it, there is an urgent need to develop antitumor agents to treat temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma. Gossypol, a natural polyphenolic compound, has been studied as a monotherapy or combination therapy for the treatment of glioblastoma. The combination of gossypol and temozolomide has been shown to inhibit glioblastoma, but it is not clear yet whether gossypol alone can suppress temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma. We find that gossypol suppresses the growth of temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma cells in both tumor sphere and adherent culture conditions, with tumor spheres showing the greatest sensitivity. Molecular docking and binding energy calculations show that gossypol has a similar affinity to the Bcl2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) family of proteins and several dehydrogenases. Gossypol reduces mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular ATP levels before cell death, which suggests that gossypol inhibits several dehydrogenases in the cell's metabolic pathway. Treatment with a Bcl2 inhibitor does not fully explain the effect of gossypol on glioblastoma. Overall, this study demonstrates that gossypol can suppress temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma and will be helpful for the refinement of gossypol treatments by elucidating some of the molecular mechanisms of gossypol in glioblastoma.

Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) were used to find the interacting gene with SEPT9. Immunostaining of CD206 in cervical cancer and polarization of macrophages (M2) were evaluated by immunofluorescence and WB.

SEPT9 promotes proliferation, invasion, migration, and influences the cell cycle of cervical cancer. SEPT9 interacted with HMGB1-RB axis increases irradiation resistance. Furthermore, SEPT9 mediated miR-375 via the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization, affecting the resistance to radiotherapy in cervical cancer.||||These findings give us the evidence that SEPT9 methylation could be a biomarker for cervical cancer diagnoses. It promotes tumorigenesis and radioresistance of cervical cancer by targeting HMGB1-RB axis and causes polarization of macrophages by mediating miR-375. We suggest SEPT9 could be a potential screening and therapeutic biomarker for cervical cancer.

The expression levels of PSMC2 in cancer tissue were dramatically upregulated compared with adjacent normal tissues. In vitro, shPSMC2 was designed to inhibit the expression of PSMC2 in CRC cells. Compared with shCtrl, silencing of PSMC2 significantly suppressed cell proliferation, decreased single cell colony formation, enhanced apoptosis, and accelerated G2 phase and/or S phase arrest.||||Survival analysis indicated that high expression of PSMC2 in the CRC samples was associated with poorer survival rate than low expression of PSMC2, while the anti-tumor effect of PSMC2 silencing was also confirmed at the cellular level in vitro.

They were divided as: i) Group A1 (n=30) participants with diabetes for <5 years without microalbuminuria ii) Group A2 (n= 30) subjects with diabetes for 6-10 years with microalbuminuria; iii) Group B (n=25) subjects as healthy control group. All study participants were followed for 6 months and their blood glucose, urea, creatinine, electrolytes, albuminuria and serum KIM-1 were assayed.||||High KIM-1 at baseline was present in group A2 patients as compared to controls and group A1 (p<0.001). Higher levels were seen after six months in group A1 along with the presence of micro albuminuria (p<0.001) suggesting kidney damage. Moderate positive association were seen for KIM1 with creatinine levels (r=0.530; p<0.001), and HbA1c (r=0.576; p<0.001) in all patients.

High-mobility group box 2 promoted proliferation of cervical cancer cells by activating AKT signaling pathway.||||||||Cervical cancer is one of the leading killers for female worldwide. Nevertheless, the less knowledge of molecular mechanism for cervical cancer limited the improvement of treatment effects. High-mobility group box 2 (HMGB2) belongs to the HMGB family, which could play diverse roles in cell proliferation. This work mainly aimed to study the functions of HMGB2 on cervical cancer cells proliferation. HMGB2 was highly expressed in cervical cancer tissue. The results of real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis showed that HMGB2 was expressed in all the five cervical cancer cells (HeLa, CaSki, SiHa, C-33A, and C4-1 cells). In addition, HMGB2 overexpression obviously improved cell viability and promoted cell cycle progression, which suggested that HMGB2 could promote proliferation of cervical cancer cells. Moreover, HMGB2 overexpression increased the level of p-AKT and reduced the levels of p21 and p27. However, HMGB2 downregulation had contrary influences on cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution and the levels of p-AKT, p21, and p27. Notably, LY294002, as an inhibitor of AKT signaling pathway, could significantly weaken the effects of HMGB2 overexpression, which indicated that HMGB2 might promote cell proliferation by activating AKT signaling pathway. Therefore, HMGB2 was hopeful to be a candidate as a new biomarker and therapy target for cervical cancer.

But, whether NGR1 is utilized in neonatal pneumonia is not clear. This research study aspired to disclose the protective activity of NGR1 in neonatal pneumonia. WI-38 cells were co-stimulated with NGR1 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 ng/mL), CCK-8 and flow cytometry assays were implemented for cell viability and apoptosis assessment. Real-time quantitative plymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Western blot analysis were executed for inflammatory cytokine determination.

StarBase (version 3.0) found that the expression of NASP was increased with the down-regulation of miR-381-3p in laryngocarcinoma tissue, AMC-HN-3，FaDu，HNE-3，and Detroit 562 cell lines. MiR-381-3p could target NASP, reduce the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, Vimentin, repress the cell viability, invasion, and migration, and promote the expression of E-cadherin in AMC-HN-3 cells. Overexpressed NASP could increase the viability, migration and invasion rates in AMC-HN-3 cells, which could be partially reversed by overexpressed miR-381-3p.

The time-consuming and money-costing biological experiment makes researchers turn to develop more advanced algorithms to identify AD-related proteins.||||Firstly, we proposed a hypothesis "similar diseases share similar related proteins". Therefore, five similarity calculation methods are introduced to find out others diseases which are similar to AD. Then, these diseases' related proteins could be obtained by public data set. Finally, these proteins are features of each disease and could be used to map their similarity to AD. We developed a novel method 'LRRGD' which combines Logistic Regression (LR) and Gradient Descent (GD) and borrows the idea of Random Forest (RF). LR is introduced to regress features to similarities. Borrowing the idea of RF, hundreds of LR models have been built by randomly selecting 40 features (proteins) each time. Here, GD is introduced to find out the optimal result. To avoid the drawback of local optimal solution, a good initial value is selected by some known AD-related proteins. Finally, 376 proteins are found to be related to AD.||||Three hundred eight of three hundred seventy-six proteins are the novel proteins. Three case studies are done to prove our method's effectiveness. These 308 proteins could give researchers a basis to do biological experiments to help treatment and diagnostic AD.

Klotho/FGF23 axis mediates high phosphate-induced vascular calcification in vascular smooth muscle cells via Wnt7b/β-catenin pathway.||||||||Vascular calcification (VC) plays as a critical role on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and acts as a notable risk factor in cardiovascular system. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) calcification can be triggered by high phosphate treatment; however, the explicit mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we isolated VSMCs from primary rat artery, applied β-GP (β-glycerophosphate) for inducing VSMCs calcification in vitro to explore the mechanism of phosphate-induced calcification in VSMCs. Alizarin red staining was performed to assess the mineralization in VSMCs. Calcium deposition experiment was taken to evaluate the calcium content. ALP staining was determined to assess the ALP activity. The recombinant adenoviruses were constructed for the overexpression of Klotho and FGF23, respectively. qRT-PCR and western blot analysis were subjected to measure the expression of Klotho/FGF23 and correlated genes among Wnt7b/β-catenin pathway. We found that the calcium content was obviously increased and Alizarin red staining was positive in calcification group exposure with high phosphate in a time-dependent manner. The expression of Klotho and FGF23 was significantly decreased in the calcification group. However, overexpression of Klotho and FGF23 markedly reversed VSMCs calcification stimulating with high phosphate treatment. Moreover, Wnt7b/β-catenin inhibitor DKK1 could partly attenuate the effect of high phosphate on calcified VSMCs. These findings demonstrated that Klotho/FGF23 axis could modulate high phosphate-induced VSMCs calcification via Wnt7b/β-catenin signaling pathway. Our findings unravel that Klotho/FGF23- Wnt7b/β-catenin axis functions as a crucial role in the VSMCs calcification.

[Caveolin-1: oxidative stress target in tumor cells].||||||||Aberrant oxidative metabolism in cells is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Overproduction of reactive species promotes carcinogenesis by inducing genetic mutations and activating oncogenic pathways, and thus, antioxidant therapy is considered as an important strategy for cancer prevention and treatment. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a constituent protein of caveolae, is involved in not only the formation of the caveolae, vesicular transport, maintaining cholesterol homeostasis directly, but also many cellular physiological and pathological processes including growth, regulation of mitochondrial antioxidant level, apoptosis and carcinomas by interacting with a lot of signaling molecules through caveolin scaffolding domain. Cav-1 has also been shown to mediate tumor genesis and progression through oxidative stress modulation, while Cav-1-targeted treatment could scavenge the reactive species. Intracellular reactive species could modulate the expression, degradation, post-translational modifications and membrane trafficking of Cav-1. More importantly, emerging evidence has indicated that multiple antioxidants could exert antitumor activities in cancer cells by modulating the signaling of Cav-1. This paper reviewed the research progresses on the roles of Cav-1 and oxidative stress in tumorigenesis and development, and would provide new insights on designing strategies for cancer prevention or treatment.

[CHEK1 expression and inhibitors in TP53 mutant cancer].||||||||The most frequently mutated gene in human tumors is TP53 and its mutation significantly deteriorates patients' survival. However, to date no targeted therapy is established for TP53 mutated tumors. Here, our aim was to identify druggable kinases with higher expression in TP53 mutated tumors, as well as relate these to altered prognosis. We also aimed to validate a target gene in TP53 wild type and mutant isogenic cell lines using a specific kinase inhibitor. Gene expression and mutation data were collected from 994 lung tumor samples. Samples were separated based on TP53 mutation status, and differential gene expression was compared using Mann-Whitney test between patient cohorts. Prognostic value of identified genes was validated in an array-based lung cancer dataset (n=1926). Survival analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier survival plots. Effect of TP53 mutations on CHEK1 expression was validated in the A549 isogenic lung cancer cell line. The cell line was also treated using Chk1 protein specific kinase inhibitor to monitor cell functions. Expression of CHEK1 was elevated significantly among targetable kinases and higher expression of CHEK1 related to worse prognosis. Our results confirm the higher expression of CHEK1 kinase associated to TP53 mutations and to shorter survival.

A renal cell carcinoma with EWSR1-TFE3 fusion gene.||||||||Both EWSR1 and TFE3 are well-known oncogenes. EWSR1 encodes an RNA-binding protein involved in multiple soft tissue tumors, including Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumor, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, soft tissue clear cell sarcoma (malignant melanoma of soft parts), extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, and myxoid liposarcomas. TFE3 regulates both Golgi and lysosomal homeostasis and is rearranged in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), alveolar soft part sarcoma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, and perivascular epitheloid cell tumors (PEComas). In this report, we found a rare case of RCC with a fusion between 5' EWSR1 and 3' TFE3. The fusion product retained most functional motifs of TFE3. The oncogenic mechanism likely involves TFE3 overexpression through its juxtaposition with the regulatory elements of EWSR1 and its translocation to the nucleus, resulting in the deregulation of Golgi and lysosomal homeostasis. This is a second case of RCC containing EWSR1-TFE3 fusion.

Activated protein C in neuroprotection and malaria.||||||||Activated protein C (APC) is a homeostatic coagulation protease with anticoagulant and cytoprotective activities. Focusing on APC's effects in the brain, this review discusses three different scenarios that illustrate how APC functions are intimately affecting the physiology and pathophysiology of the brain.||||Cytoprotective APC therapy holds promise for the treatment of ischemic stroke, and a recently completed trial suggested that cytoprotective-selective 3K3A-APC reduced bleeding in ischemic stroke patients. In contrast, APC's anticoagulant activity contributes to brain bleeding as shown by the disproportional upregulation of APC generation in cerebral cavernous malformations lesions in mice. However, too little APC generation also contributes to maladies of the brain, such as in case of cerebral malaria where the binding of infected erythrocytes to the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) may interfere with the EPCR-dependent functions of the protein C pathway. Furthermore, discoveries of new activities of APC such as the inhibition of the NLRP3-mediated inflammasome and of new applications of APC therapy such as in Alzheimer's disease and graft-versus-host disease continue to advance our knowledge of this important proteolytic regulatory system.||||APC's many activities or lack thereof are intimately involved in multiple neuropathologies, providing abundant opportunities for translational research.

Through a multi-centric collaboration, we identified six point mutations (one splice site and five missense mutations) involving ATP8A2 in six individuals from five families. Two patients from one family with the homozygous p.Gly585Val mutation had a milder presentation without encephalopathy. Expression and functional studies of the missense mutations demonstrated that protein levels of four of the five missense variants were very low and lacked phosphatidylserine-activated ATPase activity. One variant p.Ile215Leu, however, expressed at normal levels and displayed phospholipid-activated ATPase activity similar to the non-mutated protein. We therefore expand for the first time the phenotype related to ATP8A2 mutations to less severe forms characterized by cerebellar ataxia without encephalopathy and suggest that ATP8A2 should be analyzed for all cases of syndromic or non-syndromic recessive or sporadic ataxia.

Expanding the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of branched-chain amino acid transferase 2 deficiency.||||||||The first step in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism is catalyzed by the two BCAA transferase isoenzymes, cytoplasmic branched-chain amino acid transferase (BCAT) 1, and mitochondrial BCAT2. Defects in the second step of BCAA catabolism cause maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), a condition which has been far more extensively investigated. Here, we studied the consequences of BCAT2 deficiency, an ultra-rare condition in humans. We present genetic, clinical, and functional data in five individuals from four different families with homozygous or compound heterozygous BCAT2 mutations which were all detected following abnormal biochemical profile results or familial mutation segregation studies. We demonstrate that BCAT2 deficiency has a recognizable biochemical profile with raised plasma BCAAs and, in contrast with MSUD, low-normal branched-chain keto acids (BCKAs) with undetectable l-allo-isoleucine. Interestingly, unlike in MSUD, none of the individuals with BCAT2 deficiency developed acute encephalopathy even with exceptionally high BCAA levels. We observed wide-ranging clinical phenotypes in individuals with BCAT2 deficiency. While one adult was apparently asymptomatic, three individuals had presented with developmental delay and autistic features. We show that the biochemical characteristics of BCAT2 deficiency may be amenable to protein-restricted diet and that early treatment may improve outcome in affected individuals. BCAT2 deficiency is an inborn error of BCAA catabolism. At present, it is unclear whether developmental delay and autism are parts of the variable phenotypic spectrum of this condition or coincidental. Further studies will be required to explore this.

But the act of UPP1 in thyroid cancer is not explicit. In this article, we investigate the function of UPP1 expression in thyroid cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) unpaired thyroid cancer and normal RNA-seq data were downloaded, and our paired thyroid cancer and normal samples were analysed by a polymerase chain reaction. The expression of UPP1 was regulated by transfected small interfering RNA, and the function of UPP1 was determined via migration, invasion and cell proliferation assays. Western blot assay was achieved to determine the UPP1 expression correlates with the function of 5-FU regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The significant upregulation of UPP1 in thyroid cancer tissues compared with normal thyroid tissues was revealed by our data and TCGA data. UPP1 overexpression was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis, tumour stage and tumour size. In the cell, experiments showed that UPP1 low expression significantly suppressed the migration, invasion and proliferation. Western blot assay proves the effect of UPP1 expression on 5-FU regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway. UPP1 plays a crucial oncogene in thyroid cancer. Our findings indicate that UPP1 might be a biomarker of thyroid cancer and may act by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

Based on the collagen turnover profile, we identified four clusters of patients. Cluster 1 contained one patient with prostate cancer, who had a distinct collagen turnover. The other clusters generally had severe (Cluster 2), moderate (Cluster 4), or mild CKD (Cluster 3). Cluster 4 patients were characterized by higher levels of COL III, COL IV, and COL VI (all p < 0.001) degradation fragments in plasma, while patients in Clusters 2 and 4 had higher levels of COL VI formation (p < 0.05).

Connexin 26 and Connexin 43 in Canine Mammary Carcinoma.||||||||Incidence of canine mammary carcinoma is two times higher than the rate of human breast cancer. Mammary tumors are the most common type of cancer in intact female dogs and account for about half of all neoplasms in these dogs. Well-established models of breast cancer have shown that neoplastic cells often have a loss of intercellular communication, particularly gap junction proteins. Thus, the objective of this study is to explore the aspect of gap junction intercellular communication in canine mammary carcinoma, non-cancerous (CMEC) and cancerous (CMT12, CMT27, and CF41.Mg) cells, and patient-derived tumors. Both non-cancerous and cancerous mammary cells express connexins 26 and 43 using immunofluorescence; however, the level of expression is significantly different in quantitative analysis using western blot in which connexin 43 in both CMT12 and CMT27 is significantly decreased compared to CMEC. Furthermore, a decrease of gap junction capacity in CMT12 and CMT27 was observed compared to CMEC. Immunostaining of CMT27-xenograft tumors revealed positive Cx26 and negative Cx43 expression. Similarly, immunostaining of spontaneous canine mammary tumors revealed that Cx26 is present in all tumors while Cx43 is present in 25% of tumors. Overall, the study provides for the first time that a differential pattern of connexin expression exists between non-cancerous and cancerous mammary cells in dogs. This study will pave the path for further in vitro work of connexins in comparative canine models and possibly allow for novel therapeutics to be developed.

Our analysis suggests that patients with metastatic disease and a CXCL12-positive non-seminoma are at higher risk for disease recurrence after first-line chemotherapy and might thus be candidates for more intensive treatment and/or closer follow-up.

Direct Targeting Options for STAT3 and STAT5 in Cancer.||||||||Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and STAT5 are important transcription factors that are able to mediate or even drive cancer progression through hyperactivation or gain-of-function mutations. Mutated STAT3 is mainly associated with large granular lymphocytic T-cell leukemia, whereas mutated STAT5B is associated with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and γδ T-cell-derived lymphomas. Hyperactive STAT3 and STAT5 are also implicated in various hematopoietic and solid malignancies, such as chronic and acute myeloid leukemia, melanoma or prostate cancer. Classical understanding of STAT functions is linked to their phosphorylated parallel dimer conformation, in which they induce gene transcription. However, the functions of STAT proteins are not limited to their phosphorylated dimerization form. In this review, we discuss the functions and the roles of unphosphorylated STAT3/5 in the context of chromatin remodeling, as well as the impact of STAT5 oligomerization on differential gene expression in hematopoietic neoplasms. The central involvement of STAT3/5 in cancer has made these molecules attractive targets for small-molecule drug development, but currently there are no direct STAT3/5 inhibitors of clinical grade available. We summarize the development of inhibitors against the SH2 domains of STAT3/5 and discuss their applicability as cancer therapeutics.

EPEL and RUNX2 were positively correlated in tumor. Patients with high expression level of lncRNA EPEL showed poor survival. LncRNA EPEL and RUNX2 overexpression promoted, while lncRNA EPEL siRNA silencing inhibited the migration, proliferation, and invasion of gastric cancers. In addition, RUNX2 overexpression completely rescued the inhibited cancer cell migration, proliferation, and invasion caused by lncRNA EPEL siRNA silencing. Consistently, EPEL overexpression resulted in upregulated RUNX2 expression, while RUNX2 overexpression did not affect lncRNA EPEL expression.||||Therefore, lncRNA EPEL may regulate cancer cell behaviors and affect prognosis of gastric cancer by interacting with RUNX2.

Time to initiation of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer treatment does not influence patient survival: A study of US breast cancer patients.||||||||Delays in the initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy are associated with worse outcomes in patients undergoing treatment for breast cancer. However, the impact of the time to initiation of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) on patient outcomes has not previously been studied. The purpose of this study was to determine whether delays in NAC initiation impact patient survival. The National Cancer Database was queried for women ≥ 18 years old who underwent NAC within 6 months of being diagnosed with stage I-III invasive breast cancer in 2010-2011. ER+ or PR+, Her2- cancers were excluded from analysis. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to evaluate the relationship between time to NAC, sociodemographic, diagnosis, and treatment factors with patient survival. The median age of the 12 806 women included in this study was 52 (range 21-90) with 62% presenting with cT2 disease and 62% with nodal involvement. Half of the women (50%) had triple negative, 30% ER/PR+Her2+ and 20% ER-PR-Her2+ cancers. The median time to starting NAC was 4 weeks (range 0-26) for all subtypes. Time to NAC initiation was not associated with a difference in survival for triple negative or Her2+ cancers. Delays from diagnosis to starting NAC are not associated with worse survival for patients with Her2+ or triple negative breast cancer. This study demonstrates that the majority of women in the modern era start NAC in a timely fashion and delays in starting NAC within 6 months of diagnosis do not impact long-term patient outcomes.

Esophageal cancer cells TE-1 and SKYE30 were cultured. The effects of miR-124 on tumor size and metastasis were analyzed. The functions of miR-124 in cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis were detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), transwell and flow cytometry, respectively. Rescue experiments were performed to assess whether miR-124 could regulate the proliferation, migration and apoptosis of esophageal cancer cells by inhibiting PDCD6 expression.||||The expression of miR-124 in cancer tissues of esophageal cancer patients were lower than that of the control group. In addition, its expression in patients with stage III-IV esophageal cancer was remarkably lower than that in patients with stage I-II. Based on the level of miR-124, we divided the patients into high and low expression group, and found significant differences in tumor size, tumor metastasis and lymph node metastasis between the two groups. Also, overexpression of miR-124 reduced the proliferation and migration of TE-1 and SKYSE30 cells and increased the apoptosis, and vice versa. Luciferase reporting assay results confirmed that PDCD6 was one of the target genes of miR-124. A further mechanism study demonstrated that overexpression of PDCD6 in TE-1 and SKYSE30 cells could partially reverse the effect of miR-124 on cell apoptosis.||||The low expression of miR-124 can promote the proliferation as well as migration of esophageal cancer cells and inhibit cell apoptosis. The mechanism may be that miR-124 can regulate the expression of PDCD6.

Filtering through the role of NRF2 in kidney disease.||||||||Kidney disease affects ~ 10% of the population worldwide, resulting in millions of deaths each year. Mechanistically, oxidative stress is a major driver of various kidney diseases, and promotes the progression from acute to chronic injury, as well as renal cancer development. NRF2, the master regulator of redox balance, has been shown to protect against kidney disease through its negation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, many kidney diseases exhibit high levels of ROS as a result of decreased NRF2 protein levels and transcriptional activity. Many studies have tested the strategy of using NRF2 inducing compounds to alleviate ROS to prevent or slow down the progression of kidney diseases. Oppositely, in specific subsets of renal cancer, NRF2 is constitutively activated and contributes to tumor burden and overall poor prognosis; therefore, there has been a recent interest in studies investigating the benefits of NRF2 inhibition. In this review, we summarize recent literature investigating the role of NRF2 and oxidative stress in various kidney diseases, and how pharmacological modification of NRF2 signaling could play a protective role.

GRK2 promotes growth of medulloblastoma cells and protects them from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.||||||||G-protein coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2; ADRBK1, BARK1) is most known as a regulator of G-protein coupled receptors. However, GRK2 also has other functions. Medulloblastomas are the most common malignant brain cancers in children. GRK2 has not been implicated in medulloblastoma biology. Here we report that GRK2 knockdown slowed cell growth, diminished proliferation, and enhanced cisplatin- and etoposide-induced apoptosis in medulloblastoma cell lines UW228-2 and Daoy. Reciprocally, GRK2 overexpression attenuated apoptosis induced by these chemotherapy drugs. Cisplatin and etoposide increased phosphorylation of AKT (S473) and GRK2 knockdown mitigated this increase. Cisplatin and etoposide attenuated ERK phosphorylation, but GRK2 knockdown did not alter this effect. Wildtype GRK2 reversed the increase in cisplatin- and etoposide-induced apoptosis caused by GRK2 knockdown. GRK2-K220R (kinase dead) and GRK2-S670A (unphosphorylated, constitutively active) conferred protection from cisplatin that was similar to wildtype GRK2, suggesting that this protection may be mediated though a kinase-independent activity of GRK2. These data demonstrate that GRK2 contributes to proliferation and survival of these medulloblastoma cell lines and to their protection from cisplatin- and etoposide-induced apoptosis.

HER2-targeted therapy has remarkably improved the overall survival of patients with HER2 amplified tumors. To date, HER2 assessment has produced contradictory results in ITAC. The aim of this study was to assess HER2 status at both protein and DNA levels in a large series of ITAC. HER2 status was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) in forty-three patients that underwent surgical resection for ITAC at the Otorhinolaryngology Section, Padua University Hospital, between 2007 and 2016. IHC was evaluated using the four-tier score developed for gastroesophageal cancer. As for IHC, 83.7% (36/43) of ITAC were scored 0, 14% (6/43) 1+, and 2.3% (1/43) 2+. No HER2 amplification was detected by CISH. The present is the largest study of sinonasal ITAC tested with both IHC and CISH confirmation for HER2 status. No HER2 overexpression/amplification was detected. Contrary to previous studies, our findings seem to rule out any oncogenetic role of HER2 in ITAC pathogenesis.

HER2-targeted therapies - a role beyond breast cancer.||||||||HER2 is an established therapeutic target in a large subset of women with breast cancer; a variety of agents including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib, neratinib and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) have been approved for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. HER2 is also overexpressed in subsets of patients with other solid tumours. Notably, the addition of trastuzumab to first-line chemotherapy has improved the overall survival of patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer, and has become the standard-of-care treatment for this group of patients. However, trials involving pertuzumab, lapatinib and T-DM1 have failed to provide significant improvements in the outcomes of patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer. HER2-targeted therapies are also being tested in patients with other solid tumours harbouring HER2 overexpression, and/or amplifications or other mutations of the gene encoding HER2 (ERBB2), including biliary tract, colorectal, non-small-cell lung and bladder cancers. The experience with gastric cancer suggests that the successes observed in HER2-positive breast cancer might not be replicated in these other tumour types, owing to differences in the level of HER2 overexpression and other aspects of disease biology. In this Review, we describe the current role of HER2-targeted therapies beyond breast cancer and also highlight the potential of novel HER2-targeted agents that are currently in clinical development.

Collapsin response mediator protein 5 (CRMP5) causes social deficits and accelerates memory loss in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease.||||||||Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by several behavioral disturbances, especially cognitive decline and deficits in social competence. Previous studies revealed that decreased social activity would accelerate AD progression, whereas enhanced social interaction could rescue AD-induced memory impairment. Collapsin response mediator protein 5 (CRMP5), which belongs to a family of cytosolic proteins, is abundantly expressed in the brain and is involved in the regulation of neurodevelopment and the pathology of several neuropsychiatric diseases. However, the functions of CRMP5 in AD are still unclear. Here, we demonstrated that 9-month-old 3xTg-AD mice exhibited social behavioral deficits and increased hippocampal CRMP5 levels compared to control (B6129S) mice. Knockdown of CRMP5 reversed the social deficits in 9-month-old 3xTg-AD mice, whereas CRMP5 overexpression decreased social interaction in both 3xTg-AD and control mice at 6 months of age. Interestingly, decreased expression of CRMP5 rescued AD-induced memory impairment, but overexpression of CRMP5 accelerated memory loss only in 3xTg-AD mice. In addition, we found that CRMP5 could regulate surface GluA2 and GluA2 S880 phosphorylation. These results suggest that CRMP5 regulates social behavior via modulation of surface GluA2 trafficking and affects memory performance in 3xTg-AD mice.

Meningioma-like Tumor of the Skin Revisited: A Distinct CD34+ Dermal Tumor With an Expanded Histologic Spectrum.||||||||The term meningioma-like tumor of the skin (MLTS) was coined in 1993 to designate a particular whorled spindle cell superficial cutaneous tumor. No additional confirmed cases of this entity have been reported to date. Some authors have speculated that these cases might be cellular neurothekeomas. In order to delineate the histologic spectrum and the immunophenotype of this unusual tumor, we studied 5 cases, 2 previously unreported and the 3 original cases. The immunohistochemical findings of case 5, however, were limited to those from the original study. Clinically, the tumor presented as a reddish papule, plaque, or nodule, located in the extremities or trunk. The patient often referred to a recent growth of a longstanding lesion. Histologically, the characteristic whorled spindle and stellate dendritic cell population, commonly in a perivascular arrangement, and variable myxoid component, were consistently found in all cases. A prominent microvasculature was also a constant finding. The presence of large deciduoid cells was conspicuous in one case. A reticular pattern of multivacuolated cells giving a chordoma-like appearance was evident in another case. Tumor cells were diffusely positive for CD34 in all 4 cases studied, and negative for S-100, EMA, NKI-C3, CD68, and smooth muscle markers. No complete loss of retinoblastoma protein was found. No brachyury immunostaining was found in the case with chordoid features. No EWSR1 or NAB2-STAT6 gene fusions were found. From these findings, we demonstrate that MLTS is a distinct CD34 spindle cell benign dermal tumor, unrelated to cellular neurothekeoma, and exhibiting myxoid, deciduoid, or chordoma-like features.

Frequent overexpression of klotho in fusion-negative phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors with tumorigenic implications.||||||||Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors (PMT) are tumors that cause hypophosphatemia/osteomalacia chiefly by secreting FGF23. We have identified FN1-FGFR1/FGF1 fusion genes in nearly half of PMT, suggesting a central role of FGFR1 pathways in the pathogenesis of PMT. Tumorigenic drivers are unknown for tumors where previous study detected neither fusion, including many in bone, where FISH failed because of tissue decalcification. To identify alternative fusions in PMT without known fusions, as well as to validate the positive FISH results and characterize the fusion junctions, 34 PMT were studied, including 12 with known FN1-FGFR1 fusion by FISH (Group A), 2 with FN1-FGF1 (B), 12 with neither fusion (C), and 8 with previous acid-based decalcification and hence unknown fusion status (D). In total, 23 archival samples were subjected to anchored multiplex PCR-based RNA-sequencing (AMP-seq) with primers targeting FN1, genes encoding the FGF/FGFR families, and KL (α-Klotho); five Group C cases were also studied with whole-transcriptomic and exome-captured RNA sequencing, respectively. The AMP-seq results were consistent with previous FISH and/or transcriptomic sequencing data, except in one old Group A sample. One case had a novel FGFR1 exon 9 breakpoint, confirmed by genomic DNA sequencing. One Group D bone tumor was found to harbor FN1-FGF1. All 3 RNA-sequencing platforms failed to identify convincing fusion genes in Group C (N = 10), which instead expressed significantly higher levels of either KL or KLB. This result was further confirmed with KL and KLB RNA CISH semi-quantification (RNAscope). Our results demonstrated the utility of AMP-seq, which was compromised by decalcification and prolonged archiving. Of potential importance, fusion-negative PMT frequently overexpressed α-Klotho (or instead β-Klotho less commonly), whose role as an obligatory co-receptor for FGF23-FGFR1 binding suggests its aberrant expression in osteocytes/osteoblasts might result in an FGF23-FGFR1 autocrine loop that in turn drives the overexpression of FGF23 and tumorigenesis through activated FGFR pathways.

Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded testicular tissues by 5 patients who underwent an orchidectomy for seminoma have been collected and immunofluorescence analysis was performed using antibody rabbit monoclonal PTTG-1 and mouse monoclonal OCT4 or mouse monoclonal KLF4 antibody. In seminoma we observed that tumor cells strongly express OCT-4 in all seminomas and in the intratubular areas of seminoma. Expression of KLF-4 was observed in many tumor cells. PTTG1 marks some specific OCT4- and KLF4-positive tumor cells, mainly localized at the periphery of the neoplasm. In the intertubular infiltration areas nests of cells expressing both OCT4/KLF4 and PTTG1 have been observed. This is the first identification of a cell population in seminoma characterized for being OCT4, KLF4, and PTTG1 positive cells in seminoma, associated with cancer invasiveness. Further investigation is needed to elucidate if a functional abrogation of PTTG1 might be used in order to offer new therapeutic approaches in the clinical workout of seminoma.

Regulation of apoptosis by E3 ubiquitin ligases in UPS.||||||||Apoptosis is an organized ATP-dependent programmed cell death that organisms have evolved to maintain homeostatic cell numbers and eliminate unnecessary or unhealthy cells from the system. Dysregulation of apoptosis can have serious manifestations culminating into various diseases, especially cancer. Accurate control of apoptosis requires regulation of a wide range of growth enhancing as well as anti-oncogenic factors. Appropriate regulation of magnitude and temporal expression of key proteins is vital to maintain functional apoptotic signalling. Controlled protein turnover is thus critical to the unhindered operation of the apoptotic machinery, disruption of which can have severe consequences, foremost being oncogenic transformation of cells. The Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) is one such major cellular pathway that maintains homeostatic protein levels. Recent studies have found interesting links between these two fundamental cellular processes wherein UPS depending on the cue, can either inhibit or promote apoptosis. A diverse range of E3 ligases are involved in regulating the turnover of key proteins of the apoptotic pathway. This review summarizes an overview of key E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in the regulation of the fundamental proteins involved in apoptosis, linking UPS to apoptosis and attempts to emphasize the significance of this relationship in context of cancer.

The relationship between ROCK1 mRNA and clinical characteristics was analyzed via Chi-square test. The criteria of diagnosis evaluation, including sensitivity, specificity, optimal cutoff point, and area under the curve (AUC) were determined through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.ROCK1 mRNA was significantly increased in serum samples collected from glioma patients compared to the controls (P <.05). Besides, high ROCK1 mRNA expression was tightly related with Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score (P = .024) and World Health Organization (WHO) grade (P = .029). However, there was no association between ROCK1 expression and gender, neurological disorders, family history and cigarette smoking (all, P >.05). In addition, the optimal cutoff point was 3.025, with the sensitivity and specificity of 88.89% and 79.25%, respectively. The AUC was 0.881, indicating that ROCK1 was a diagnostic biomarker for glioma patients (P <.0001, 95% CI = 0.829-0.933).Serum ROCK1 mRNA is significantly up-regulated in glioma cases compared to healthy controls.

Role of NKG2D and its ligands in cancer immunotherapy.||||||||The activating receptor natural killer group 2, member D (NKG2D) is involved in both innate and adaptive immunities, and functions as a "master switch" in determining the activation status of natural killer (NK) cells. NKG2D binds to a diverse family of ligand molecules, which are only expressed at low levels in normal cells but can be upregulated by a cellular stress response. The NKG2D-NKG2D ligand (NKG2DL) pathway has been considered to be promising target for immunotherapy because of the selective expression of "stress-induced ligands" on tumor cells and the strong NK cell activating potency of NKG2D. Diverse strategies that are aimed at targeting the NKG2D pathway for cancer therapy are based on a thorough understanding of this mechanism, as well as that of NKG2D-mediated cancer immunity. In this review, we summarize the major findings regarding the antitumor immune response mediated by the NKG2D receptor and its ligands, and discuss the potential clinical applications of targeting the NKG2D/NKG2DL pathway for immunotherapy in cancer patients.

Roles of TRPM7 in Renal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.||||||||Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) that is a global health concern associated with high morbidity and mortality. So far, no specific interventions limit injury or improve recovery and survival. Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7), a bifunctional membrane protein, plays key roles in inflammation and cell death. However, the precise role and underlying mechanism of TRPM7 in IR-induced AKI have not been well defined. Herein, we reviewed the structure and function of TRPM7 as a non-selective ion channel, but Ca2+ and Mg2+-conducting, that mediated the elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ and Mg2+. We then comprehensively reviewed the mechanism of TRPM7 involved in the pathophysiology of renal IRI, including inflammatory response, apoptosis and necroptosis, renal microvasculature, as well as maladaptive fibrogenesis leading to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Our previous study has shown that the dynamic change and underlying mechanism of TRPM7 involving in inflammation and apoptosis in in vitro hypoxia/reoxygenation and in vivo renal IRI models. The association between TRPM7, inflammatory response and apoptosis, as well as related caspase-3, HMGB1 and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, was also discussed. Disclosing the involvement of TRPM7 in renal IRI might provide new mechanistic insights for a potential biomarker as diagnostic and therapeutic target of AKI.

Relationship between SDC1 and cadherin signalling activation in cancer.||||||||E-cadherin and SDC1 are markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that can be used to assess tumour prognosis. SDC1 has different effects in various types of cancers. On the one hand, reduced expression of SDC1 can leads to advantage stages of some cancers, such as gastric and colorectal cancer. On the other hand, SDC1 overexpression can also promote the growth and proliferation of cancer cells in pancreatic and breast cancer. However, the function of SDC1 is influenced and regulated by many factors. Exfoliated extracellular domain HS chain can mediate the function of SDC1 and play an important role in the occurrence and development of cancer. SDC1 binds to various ligands and influences the growth and reproduction of cancer cells via the activation of Wnt, the long isoform of FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP long), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and MAPK/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and other pathways. Cadherins occur in several types, but this review focuses on classical cadherins. N-cadherin and P-cadherin are activated during tumour development, whereas E-cadherin is a tumour suppressor. The cellular signalling pathways involved in classical cadherins, such as Wnt and VEGFR pathways, are also related to SDC1. The activation of E-cadherin caused by SDC1 knockdown has also been observed. Despite this evidence, no articles regarding the relationship of SDC1 and cadherin activation have been published. This review summarises the expressions of these two molecules in different cancers and analyses their possible relationship to provide insights into future cancer research and clinical treatment.

Targeting PD-1/PD-L1 to treat cancer has shown benefits in many patients, suggesting a promising opportunity to target this pathway in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Here, we systematically evaluate the diverse biological functions of the PD-1/PD-L pathway in immune-mediated diseases and the relevant mechanisms that control these immune reactions.

PET-CT imaging features that differentiate between positive and negative EWSR1 translocation in Ewing sarcoma.||||||||Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (EWSR1) translocation-negative tumors represent a minor portion of small round cell tumors consistent with Ewing sarcoma morphology. The purpose of this study was to differentiate EWSR1 translocation-positive tumors from EWSR1 translocation-negative tumors using PET-computed tomography features.||||In this retrospective study 27, Ewing sarcoma patients (December 2011 to November 2016) were divided into two groups, EWSR1 translocation-positive and EWSR1 translocation-negative based on cytogenetic analysis. Pretreatment standardized uptake value maximum (SUVmax) and Hounsfield Units (HU) were measured in the primary tumor in the axial slice with the largest tumor diameter.The associations between SUVmax, HU and the presence of EWSR1 translocation were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine cut-off levels of SUVmax and HU suggestive of EWSR1-negative tumors.||||Twenty-one patients were classified as EWSR1-positive and six as EWSR1-negative. Eighteen had SUVmax and 21 had HU measurements. EWSR1-negative tumors had significantly higher SUVmax values (P = 0.003) and significantly lower HU values (P = 0.008). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that SUVmax had diagnostic ability to discriminate between EWSR1-negative and EWSR1-positive tumors (area under the curve = 0.964, P = 0.006). A SUVmax of at least 10 had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 85.7% for EWSR1-negative tumors. HU had lower diagnostic ability than SUVmax (area under the curve = 0.881, P = 0.012). A HU up to 57 had a sensitivity of 81.3% and specificity of 80.0% for EWSR1-negative tumors.||||Higher SUVmax and lower HU may differentiate between EWSR1-positive and EWSR1-negative tumors.

Wild type- and mutant p53 proteins in mitochondrial dysfunction: emerging insights in cancer disease.||||||||Deregulated cell metabolism is one of the cancer hallmarks. Mitochondrial DNA mutations and enzyme defects, aberrant tumor suppressor or oncogenic activities cause mitochondrial dysfunction leading to deregulated cellular energetics. The tumor suppressor protein, p53 is a tetrameric transcription factor that in response to diverse genotoxic and non-genotoxic insults activates a plethora of target genes to preserve genome integrity. In the last two decades the discovery of cytoplasmic p53 localization focused intense research on its extra-nuclear functions. The ability of p53 to induce apoptosis acting directly at mitochondria and the related mechanisms of p53 localization and translocation in the cytoplasm have been investigated. A role of cytoplasmic p53 in autophagy, pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid synthesis and oxidation, and drug response has been proposed. TP53 gene is mutated in more than half of human cancers. In parallel to loss of tumor suppressive functions, mutant p53 proteins often gain new tumorigenic activities (GOF, gain of function). It has been recently shown that mutant p53 proteins mediate metabolic changes thereby promoting cancer development and metastases. Here we review the contribution of either wild-type p53 or mutant p53 proteins to the fine-tuning of mitochondrial metabolism of both normal and cancer cells. Greater knowledge at the mechanistic level might provide insights to develop new cancer therapeutic approaches.

B7-H3 and its role in bone cancers.||||||||Most bone cancers have a high risk of metastasis, recurrence, and poor prognosis. Although conventional treatments are still the most important therapy, disadvantages still exist. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop effective strategies. Immunotherapy is a promising therapy. Immunotherapies targeting checkpoints have proven to be successful, but B7-H3 (CD276, clusters of differentiation protein 276), a member of the B7-family of co-stimulatory molecules, is not being widely studied in bone cancers. This review summarized the studies on B7-H3 in bone cancers. 4 studies investigated B7-H3 expression in osteosarcoma, but there is no study on B7-H3 expression in chondrosarcoma. Two studies investigated the possibility to treat Ewing`s sarcoma through targeting the B7-H3 CAR (chimeric antigen receptors) T-cells or using anti-B7-H3 antibody. A study observed the growth of myeloma in B7-H3-deficient mice and the therapeutic effect of B7-H3 antibody and a study invested B7-H3 expression in myeloma patients. One study reported B7-H3 expression in osteoclastomas and one study investigated B7-H3 expression in chordoma tumor tissues. Two clinical trials are conducting on the therapy of osteosarcoma and myeloma using B7-H3 as a target. In conclusion, B7-H3 could be a target of bone cancers.

MUC4 Expression in Angiomatoid Fibrous Histiocytoma.||||||||Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (AFH) is a rarely metastasizing neoplasm that typically occurs in the deep dermis and subcutis of the extremities of young patients, characterized by a t(2;22) translocation involving EWSR1 and CREB1. Because of its distinctive histologic features, the diagnosis of AFH is generally straightforward, although the immunohistochemistry (IHC) findings are relatively nonspecific. We recently encountered a case of primary cranial AFH that showed strong MUC4 IHC expression, which has not yet been reported previously. Prompted by this surprising finding, we investigated MUC4 expression in a series of AFH to evaluate this potential diagnostic pitfall. The expression of ALK by IHC, recently discovered in AFH, was also assessed in this study. We also analyzed EWSR1 rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization using a dual color break-apart probe to confirm the diagnosis. The results showed MUC4 expression in 22.2% of AFH cases (4/18 cases), demonstrating a variable intensity of cytoplasmic staining. Most notably, one of the positive cases showed strong and diffuse expression. ALK IHC expression was observed in 17 of 18 cases (94.4%), usually in a diffuse and strong cytoplasmic pattern. EWSR1 rearrangement was demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 81.2% of cases (13 of 16), including all the MUC4-positive cases. Our results indicate that although the significance of MUC4 expression in AFH is unknown, it is important to be aware that a subset of AFH can express the protein by IHC, expanding a variety of MUC4-positive mesenchymal tumors.

Paxillin regulated genomic networks in prostate cancer.||||||||Paxillin is extensively involved in focal adhesion signaling and kinase signaling throughout the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. However, recent studies in prostate cancer suggest that paxillin also plays a critical role in regulating gene expression within the nucleus, serving as a liaison between cytoplasmic and nuclear MAPK and Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling. Here we used RNA-seq to examine the paxillin-regulated transcriptome in several human prostate cancer cell lines. First, we examined paxillin effects on androgen-mediated transcription in control or paxillin-depleted AR-positive LNCaP and C4-2 human prostate cancer cells. In androgen-dependent LNCaP cells, we found over 1000 paxillin-dependent androgen-responsive genes, some of which are involved in endocrine therapy resistance. Most paxillin-dependent AR-mediated genes in LNCaP cells were no longer paxillin-dependent in androgen-sensitive, castration-resistant C4-2 cells, suggesting that castration-resistance may markedly alter paxillin effects on genomic AR signaling. To examine the paxillin-regulated transcriptome in the absence of androgen signaling, we performed RNA-seq in AR-negative PC3 human prostate cancer cells. Paxillin enhanced several pro-proliferative pathways, including the CyclinD/Rb/E2F and DNA replication/repair pathways. Additionally, paxillin suppressed pro-apoptotic genes, including CASP1 and TNFSF10. Quantitative PCR confirmed that these pathways are similarly regulated by paxillin in LNCaP and C4-2 cells. Functional studies showed that, while paxillin stimulated cell proliferation, it had minimum effect on apoptosis. Thus, paxillin appears to be an important transcriptional regulator in prostate cancer, and analysis of its transcriptome might lead to novel approaches toward the diagnosis and treatment of this important disease.

Prognostic value of IL-34 in colorectal cancer patients.||||||||The mortality of colorectal cancer is expected to increase in some countries including the United States, which necessitates the identification of new molecules that help in prognosis assessment and survival improvement. In this brief report, we evaluated the potential of interleukin-34 (IL-34) as a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. IL-34 was reported for the first time in 2008 as a novel cytokine that controls the biology of the myeloid cell lineage. Accumulating evidence suggests important roles for IL-34 in modifying the tumor microenvironment and enhancing therapeutic resistance of cancer. In this study, we found that IL-34 expression was detectable in various colorectal cancer cell lines in addition to primary cancer tissues from a cohort of Japanese colorectal cancer patients, ranging from high to absent. A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that high expression of IL-34 correlated with poor survival of colorectal cancer patients. Importantly, in both univariate and multivariate analysis, high IL-34 expression correlated with unfavorable prognosis. A similar relationship between IL-34 expression and the poorer prognosis was also observed in a cohort of colorectal cancer patients registered at The Cancer Genome Atlas. Together, these findings indicate a potential role for IL-34 as a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer.

[Immunohistochemical profile of renal cell tumours].||||||||Kidney cancer is among the 10 most frequent cancers in the world, each year about 270,000 cases are diagnosed and 116,000 people die from the disease. Approximately 90% of all solid kidney neoplasms are renal cell carcinomas. The incidence in Colombia is approximately 500-1000 cases per year.||||To characterize through the use of immunohistochemical markers the different renal cell tumours diagnosed in the pathology laboratory of the San José Hospital (HSJ) and the University Infantil Hospital of San José (HUISJ) in Bogotá.||||A retrospective review was performed of the Hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemistry slides of all renal cell carcinomas diagnosed in women and men over 18 years in the pathology laboratory of the HSJ and the HUISJ from Bogotá from January 2014 to December 2016. The antibodies used were: CAIX (carbonic anhydrase), RCC (renal cell carcinoma marker), vimentin, CD10, CK7, TFE3 (transcription factor binding to IGHM enhancer 3), CD117, CD15, CK20, cadherin and PAX8. Absolute and relative frequencies of the different markers were reported through univariate and bivariate analyses with a chi-square test.||||Comparing the expression of statistically significant markers, an immunoprofile resulted for clear cell carcinoma (CRCC) versus RCC chromophobe (ChRCC) as follows: CRCC positive markers: CAIX, vimentin, CD15, CD10, cadherin and negative markers: CK7, CD117; ChRCC positive markers: CK7, CD117, CD10, cadherin and CAIX negative markers: vimentin, CD15. The PAX8 marker was positive or negative in both tumors.||||Five markers demonstrated utility and validity to differentiate between histological subtypes of CRCC and ChRCC. We propose the combination of markers (CAIX, CK7, vimentin, CD15 and CD117) for the differential diagnosis between CRCC versus ChRCC.

The role of protein SUMOylation in rheumatoid arthritis.||||||||Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins, as a subgroup of post-translational modifiers, act to change the function of proteins. Through their interactions with different targets, immune pathways, and the responses they elicit, can be affected by these SUMO conjugations. Thus, both a change to protein function and involvement in immune pathways has the potential to promote an efficient immune response to either a pathogenic challenge, or the development of an imbalance that could lead to an autoimmune-based disease. Also, a variety of changes such as mutations and polymorphisms can interfere with common functions of these modifications and move an effective immune response in the direction of an autoimmune disease. The present review discusses the general characteristics of SUMO proteins and focuses on their involvement in rheumatoid arthritis as an autoimmune disease.

Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma in Remnant Pancreas after Pancreaticoduodenectomy for Acinar Cell Carcinoma: A Case Report.||||||||We report a case of a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in the remnant pancreas of a 78-year-old man after pancreaticoduodenectomy for acinar cell carcinoma, a relatively rare pancreatic neoplasm. After diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma, subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. The pathological diagnosis was acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas (disease stage IA, pT1, pN0, M0), without regional lymph node invasion. Cancer antigen 19-9 levels gradually increased during the 22 months after surgery, and computed tomography showed two solid tumors, 1.1 and 2.1 cm in diameter, at the site of the remnant pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration revealed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The tumor cells were not immunoreactive for trypsin. Both tumors were diagnosed as PDAC of the remnant pancreas. The patient declined curative resection, and chemoradiotherapy was started as alternative treatment. The patient died 28 months after surgery. Because this is an extremely rare case, additional cases and studies are needed in order to clarify its pathogenesis.

Whey protein in cancer therapy: A narrative review.||||||||Cancer remains a public health challenge in the identification and development of ideal pharmacological therapies and dietary strategies. The use of whey protein as a dietary strategy is widespread in the field of oncology. The two types of whey protein, sweet or acid, result from several processing techniques and possess distinct protein subfraction compositions. Mechanistically, whey protein subfractions have specific anti-cancer effects. Alpha-lactalbumin, human α-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cell, bovine α-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cell, bovine serum albumin, and lactoferrin are whey protein subfractions with potential to hinder tumor pathways. Such effects, however, are principally supported by studies performed in vitro and/or in vivo. In clinical practice, whey protein intake-induced anti-cancer effects are indiscernible. However, whey protein supplementation represents a practical, feasible, and cost-effective approach to mitigate cancer cachexia syndrome. The usefulness of whey protein is evidenced by a greater leucine content and the potential to modulate IGF-1 concentrations, representing important factors towards musculoskeletal hypertrophy. Further clinical trials are warranted and needed to establish the effects of whey protein supplementation as an adjuvant to cancer therapy.

WNT5A was shown to take part in carcinogenesis process playing both oncogenic and suppressor functions in various types of human malignancies. This study aimed to assess the expression of the WNT5A gene at the mRNA and protein levels in the specimens derived from endometrial cancer (EC) or unchanged control endometrium. The associations between the WNT5A expression levels and clinicopathological characteristics and survival of EC patients were evaluated.||||Total RNA was isolated in order to assess the relative amounts of WNT5A mRNA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) in samples of unchanged endometrial control (n = 8) and tumor samples of EC patients (n = 28). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to determine the presence of WNT5A protein in the sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens derived from unchanged endome-trial controls (n = 6) and EC tumors (n = 19). Significance of differences in WNT5A expression levels between the studied groups of EC patients and correlations between the WNT5A and demographic data, pathological features, hematological parameters and overall survival of the patients were evaluated by statistical analysis.||||The level of WNT5A mRNA was decreased in EC in comparison to unchanged endometrium. WNT5A expression was associated with primary tumor invasion status exhibiting reduced level of transcripts in EC that involved organs beyond the uterus when compared to the uterus-confined cancers. WNT5A immunoreactivity was visualized in the cytoplasm and nuclei of EC cells as well as in the luminal and glandular epithelial cells of unchanged endometrium. WNT5A mRNA expression levels correlated negatively with cytoplasmic, and positively with nuclear immunoreactivity of the WNT5A protein in the EC cells. In addition, the relationships between blood leucocyte count (in particular granulocytes and lymphocytes) of patients with EC and their WNT5A mRNA and protein expression levels were established. A positive correlation between the nuclear immunoexpression of WNT5A protein in the cancer cells in cell nuclei and mean platelet volume in blood was also found.||||The results of the first study of WNT5A expression at the transcript and protein levels indicate that it could be considered as a potential marker of molecular changes that take place during EC development.

Reduction of AHI1 in the serum of Taiwanese with probable Alzheimer's disease.||||||||The development of blood-based biomarkers for early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is desirable. In AD model mouse brain and neuronal cells, Abelson helper integration site-1 (AHI1) protein is reduced. AHI1 facilitates intracellular amyloid precursor protein (APP) translocation to inhibit amyloidogenic pathology of AD, and thus may be an AD biomarker.||||This study was conducted among 32 AD patients and 54 healthy control (HC) subjects. AHI1-related protein levels from initially collected serum samples in each group were screened using Western blotting. The protein concentrations of AHI1 and amyloid-β (Aβ), peptide(s) derived from APP, from all serum samples were analyzed using ELISA.||||In AD serum, AHI1 and a large truncated C-terminal APP fragment were significantly reduced. The average concentrations of serum AHI1 and Aβ in AD were significantly lower than those in HC. Notably, AHI1 concentration in HC serum was decreased in an age-dependent manner, while it was consistently low in AD serum and had no correlation with Aβ or mini-mental state examination score. The receiver operating characteristic analysis on all subjects demonstrated an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.7 for AHI1 on AD diagnosis, while the AUC increased to 0.82 on the subjects younger than 77 years old, suggesting a good diagnostic performance of serum AHI1 for AD especially at relatively young age.||||An early event of AHI1 reduction in the body of AD patients was observed. Serum AHI1 may be valuable for early diagnosis of AD.

Gadd45β promotes regeneration after injury through TGFβ-dependent restitution in experimental colitis.||||||||Dysregulated immune responses and impaired function in intestinal epithelial cells contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 beta (Gadd45β) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory symptoms. However, the role of Gadd45β in IBD is completely unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the role of Gadd45β in IBD. Gadd45β-KO mice exhibited drastically greater susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and mortality than C57BL/6J mice. Bone marrow transplantation experiments revealed that Gadd45β functions predominantly in the intestinal epithelium and is critical during the recovery phase. Gadd45β regulates the TGF-β signaling pathway in colon tissue and epithelial cells by inhibiting Smurf-mediated degradation of TGF-β receptor type 1 via competitive binding to the N-terminal domain of Smad7. Furthermore, these results indicate that the Gadd45β-regulated TGF-β signaling pathway is involved in wound healing by enhancing epithelial restitution. These results expand the current understanding of the function of Gadd45β and its therapeutic potential in ulcerative colitis.

TBX3 deficiency accelerates apoptosis in cardiomyoblasts through regulation of P21 expression.||||||||Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect in newborns. There is increasing evidence that apoptosis and remodeling of the cardiomyoblasts are the major pathology of CHD. Previous research found that T-box transcription factor 3 (TBX3) was compulsory for the regulation of proliferation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in various cells. Hence, TBX3 might be involved in the treatment of CHD. The primary aim of this study was to study the effects of TBX3 on apoptosis in aged cardiomyoblasts and investigate the latent mechanism. In the present study, we found TBX3 knockdown induced proliferation inhibition, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiomyoblasts at passage 10 to 15. Apoptosis-inducing effects of TBX3 silence could be neutralized by silencing P21 using specific siRNA. In addition, the mRNA and protein expression levels of TBX3 in the heart tissues of sporadic type CHD donors were obviously down-regulated. In conclusion, we demonstrated that TBX3 deficiency accelerated apoptosis via directly regulating P21 expression in senescent cardiomyoblasts.

Deciphering the Roles of Innate Lymphoid Cells in Cancer.||||||||Cancer is a complex disease and the role played by innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in cancer development has begun to be uncovered over recent years. We aim to provide an exhaustive summary of the knowledge acquired on the role of ILCs in cancer. ILCs are classified into 3 different categories, ILC1s, ILC2s, and ILC3s, each encompassing specific and unique functions. ILC1s exhibit NK cells characteristics and can exert anti-tumor functions, but surprisingly their IFNγ production is not associated with a better immune response. In response to TGF-β or IL-12, ILC1s were shown to exert pro-tumor functions and to favor tumor growth. ILC2s role in cancer immune response is dependent on cytokine context. The production of IL-13 by ILC2s is associated with a negative outcome in cancer. ILC2s can also produce IL-5, leading to eosinophil activation and an increased anti-tumor immune response in lung cancer. ILC3s produce IL-22, which could promote tumor growth. In contrast, ILC3s recognize tumor cells and facilitate leukocyte tumor entry, increasing anti-tumor immunity. In some contexts, ILC3s were found at the edge of tertiary lymphoid structures, associated with a good prognostic. We are at the dawn of our understanding of ILCs role in cancer. This review aims to thoroughly analyze existing data and to provide a comprehensive overview of our present knowledge on the impact of ILCs in cancer.

Real-time quantitative PCR and immunoblotting were also performed.||||Laboratory.||||Forty-one premenopausal women undergoing surgery for fibroids.||||Gene expression, oxygen consumption rate (OCR), extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), and cell proliferation.||||PLIN2 gene expression was 2.4-fold lower in leiomyoma compared with adjacent myometrium, suggesting a link between PLIN2 deficiency and fibroids. A total of 3877 genes were differentially expressed after PLIN2 knockdown. Gene ontology analysis identified metabolism as the second-highest biological process affected by PLIN2 depletion. OCR (mitochondrial respiration) and ECAR (glycolysis) were significantly upregulated after PLIN2 knockdown; PLIN2-depleted cells had a greater basal metabolic activity and higher metabolic stress response. Cell proliferation was also significantly increased after PLIN2 knockdown.||||PLIN2 depletion increases mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, suggesting that PLIN2 is a critical regulator of metabolic function in leiomyoma cells. PLIN2 deficiency also reprograms leiomyoma cells to a proproliferative phenotype. These findings introduce metabolomics as an area to explore to better understand leiomyoma tumorigenesis.

However, its role in pancreatic cancer progression remains unclear.||||To explore the role of SMYD3 in the pancreatic cancer.||||The expressions of SMYD3, caspase-3, and matrix metallopeptidase-2 (MMP-2) were detected in pancreatic cancer and non-tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry. The CCK-8 and transwell assays were performed to test proliferation, migration, and invasion ability in short hairpin RNA (shRNA-SMYD3) pancreatic cancer cell line SW1190. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the expressions of SMYD3, caspase-3, and MMP-2 in SW1990 cell line and shRNA-SMYD3 SW1990 cell line.||||The expressions of SMYD3, caspase-3, and MMP-2 were upregulated in pancreatic cancer. The SMYD3 was positively associated with caspase-3 and MMP-2 expressions in pancreatic cancer tissues. SMYD3, TNM stages, histological differentiation, and lymph node metastasis were identified as an independent prognostic factor. Moreover, interfered SMYD3 expression in SW1990 cell line significantly reduced the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. RT-PCR and Western blot showed the expression of MMP-2 decreased in shRNA-SMYD3 SW1990 cell line, but no significant change was observed in the caspase-3 expression.||||The overexpression of SMYD3 promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion of pancreatic cancer, and SMYD3 may affect the pancreatic cancer progression by regulating MMP-2 rather than caspase-3.

AKT1 and genetic vulnerability to bipolar disorder.||||||||AKT1 encodes a serine/threonine kinase that has as one of its best-known substrates glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), a primary target for lithium. AKT1 has been previously been implicated as a vulnerability gene for bipolar disorder (BD). We aimed to associate genetic variants in the AKT1 gene with subgroups of BD. BD patients from a Swedish cohort (N = 831) were phenotyped in regards to their psychotic episodes according to mood-congruence in depression and manias, and compared to controls (N = 1,496). All participants were genotyped for SNPs in AKT1 previously implicated to have a role: rs3730358, rs1130214 and rs3803300. None of the effects reported in earlier studies were statistically significant, including the association between rs3803300 and BD without any psychotic symptoms, rs3803300 and mood-congruent psychosis, rs3803300 and the combined groups, as well as the association between the haplotypes formed by rs3730358 and rs1130214 and risk for BD. In a Bayesian analysis, all Bayes' Factors using default priors supported the null hypothesis in the replication set by a factor of between 5 and 1300 times. Analysis of genome wide association data did not reveal any association between BD and the AKT1 region. We conclude AKT1 is less likely to be a vulnerability gene in BD.

LOXL1-AS1 involved in development of several tumors. So far, there is no study about expression and function pattern of the LOXL1-AS1 in NSCLC. In this reference, we firstly proved that LOXL1-AS1 was overexpressed in NSCLC cell lines (H23, A549, H1299 and SPC-A1) compared to 16HBE cell. The expression of LOXL1-AS1 was overexpressed in NSCLC specimens than adjacent control specimens. We found that 29 of 40 cases showed higher LOXL1-AS1 expression in NSCLC samples as compared to adjacent control specimens. Ectopic expression of LOXL1-AS1 promoted H1299 cell and H23 cell proliferation. LOXL1-AS1 overexpression promoted ki-67 and cyclin D1 expression in the NSCLC cell. Overexpression of LOXL1-AS1 promoted cell invasion and induced N-cadherin and Vimentin expression and suppressed E-cadherin expression in the NSCLC cell. LOXL1-AS1 acts as one sponge for miR-324-3p in NSCLC cell. Moreover, the expression of miR-324-3p was lower in NSCLC specimens than adjacent control specimens. We found that 24 of 40 cases showed lower miR-324-3p expression in NSCLC samples as compared to adjacent control specimens. Further correlation assay indicated a negative association between miR-324-3p and LOXL1-AS1 expression. miR-324-3p restoration attenuates the function of LOXL1-AS1 overexpression on NSCLC cell. These results indicated that LOXL1-AS1 enhanced NSCLC cell proliferation and invasion via sponging miR-324-3p in NSCLC cell.

PYK2 promotes HER2-positive breast cancer invasion.||||||||Metformin, a biguanide, is one of the most commonly prescribed treatments for type 2 diabetes and has recently been recommended as a potential drug candidate for advanced cancer therapy. Although Metformin has antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects on breast cancer, the heterogenous nature of this disease affects the response to metformin leading to the activation of pro-invasive signalling pathways that are mediated by the focal adhesion kinase PYK2 in pure HER2 phenotype breast cancer.||||The effect of metformin on different breast cancer cell lines, representing the molecular heterogenicity of the disease was investigated using in vitro proliferation and apoptosis assays. The activation of PYK2 by metformin in pure HER2 phenotype (HER2+/ER-/PR-) cell lines was investigated by microarrays, quantitative real time PCR and immunoblotting. Cell migration and invasion PYK2-mediated and in response to metformin were determined by wound healing and invasion assays using HER2+/ER-/PR- PYK2 knockdown cell lines. Proteomic analyses were used to determine the role of PYK2 in HER2+/ER-/PR- proliferative, migratory and invasive cellular pathways and in response to metformin. The association between PYK2 expression and HER2+/ER-/PR- patients' cancer-specific survival was investigated using bioinformatic analysis of PYK2 expression from patient gene expression profiles generated by the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) study. The effect of PYK2 and metformin on tumour initiation and invasion of HER2+/ER-/PR- breast cancer stem-like cells was performed using the in vitro stem cell proliferation and invasion assays.||||Our study showed for the first time that pure HER2 breast cancer cells are more resistant to metformin treatment when compared with the other breast cancer phenotypes. This drug resistance was associated with the activation of PTK2B/PYK2, a well-known mediator of signalling pathways involved in cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The role of PYK2 in promoting invasion of metformin resistant HER2 breast cancer cells was confirmed through investigating the effect of PYK2 knockdown and metformin on cell invasion and by proteomic analysis of associated cellular pathways. We also reveal a correlation between high level of expression of PYK2 and reduced survival in pure HER2 breast cancer patients. Moreover, we also report a role of PYK2 in tumour initiation and invasion-mediated by pure HER2 breast cancer stem-like cells. This was further confirmed by demonstrating a correlation between reduced survival in pure HER2 breast cancer patients and expression of PYK2 and the stem cell marker CD44.||||We provide evidence of a PYK2-driven pro-invasive potential of metformin in pure HER2 cancer therapy and propose that metformin-based therapy should consider the molecular heterogeneity of breast cancer to prevent complications associated with cancer chemoresistance, invasion and recurrence in treated patients.

ACLY facilitates colon cancer cell metastasis by CTNNB1.||||||||Colon cancer is the second leading cancer worldwide. Recurrent disease and chemotherapeutic drug resistance are very common in the advanced stage of colon cancer. ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), the first-step rate-controlling enzyme in lipid synthesis, is elevated in colon cancer. However, it remains unclear about the exact role of ACLY in the development of colon cancer metastasis.||||To evaluate the role of ACLY in colon cancer metastasis, we performed cell migration and invasion assays in two ACLY-deficient colon cancer cell lines. Colon cancer mouse model is used to examine ACLY's effects on colon metastasis potentials in vivo. We analyzed the correlation between ACLY and CTNNB1 protein in 78 colon cancer patients by Pearson correlation. To finally explore the relationship of ACLY and CTNNB1, we used western blots, migration and invasion assays to confirm that ACLY may regulate metastasis by CTNNB1.||||Our data showed that the abilities of cell migration and invasion were attenuated in ACLY-deficient HCT116 and RKO cell lines. Furthermore, we describe the mechanism of ACLY in promoting colon cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo. ACLY could stabilize CTNNB1 (beta-catenin 1) protein by interacting, and the complex might promote CTNNB1 translocation through cytoplasm to nucleus, subsequently promote the CTNNB1 transcriptional activity and migration and invasion abilities of colon cancer cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of 78 colon cancer patients showed that the high expression levels of ACLY and CTNNB1 protein was positively correlated with metastasis of colon cancer.||||These results shed new light on the molecular mechanism underlying colon cancer metastasis, which might help in improving therapeutic efficacy.

CDCA7L promotes glioma proliferation by targeting CCND1 and predicts an unfavorable prognosis.||||||||Cell division cycle associated 7 like (CDCA7L) belongs to the JPO protein family, recently identified as a target gene of c‑Myc and is frequently dysregulated in multiple cancers. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies to date have been carried out to investigate the functions of CDCA7L in glioma. Thus, in this study, the expression level of CDCA7L and its association with the prognosis in glioma were detected through the TCGA database. The mRNA expression levels of CDCA7L in glioblastoma (GBM) tissues and normal brain tissues were detected by RT‑qPCR and western blot analysis. To explore the role of CDCA7L in glioma, CDCA7L siRNA was constructed and transfected into U87 glioma cells. The expression levels of CDCA7L and cyclin D1 (CCND1) in glioma U87 cells following transfection with CDCA7L siRNA were measured by RT‑qPCR and western blot analysis. CCK‑8, colony formation, EdU and Transwell assays were used to measure the effects of CDCA7L on U87 cell proliferation, and flow cytometry was used to monitor the changes in the cell cycle following transfection with CDCA7L siRNA. Xenograft tumors were examined in vivo for the carcinogenic effects, as well as the mechanisms and prognostic value of CDCA7L in glioma tissues. The results revealed that CDCA7L was highly expressed in human GBM tissues, and a high expression of CDCA7L was associated with a poor prognosis of glioma patients through the TCGA database. We demonstrated that CDCA7L was highly expressed in human GBM tissues and 3 glioma cell lines. The downregulation CDCA7L expression significantly inhibited the proliferation and colony formation ability of U87 cells by blocking cell cycle progression in the G0/G1 phase. In addition, we found that the mRNA and protein levels of CCND1 were markedly decreased following transfection with CDCA7L siRNA compared with NC siRNA in vitro. The downregulation CDCA7L expression reduced the number of invading cells. Consistent with the results of the in vitro assays, the xenograft assay, immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay and western blot analysis demonstrated that, in response to CDCA7L inhibition, tumor growth was inhibited, Ki‑67 and CCND1 expression levels were decreased in vivo. On the whole, the results of the current study indicate that CDCA7L is highly expressed in human glioma tissues and that a high CDCA7L expression predicts a poor prognosis of glioma patients. CDCA7L promotes glioma U87 cell growth through CCND1.

In vitro, FICZ pre-treatment reduced the LPS-induced inflammation in PDLCs via the increased phosphorylation of STAT3. Additionally, FICZ prompted the mineralization of PDLCs via activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway.||||AhR signalling pathway is suppressed in periodontitis and the AhR ligand FICZ can prevent periodontitis.

Protective Effect of Taurine on Apoptosis of Spinal Cord Cells in Diabetic Neuropathy Rats.||||||||Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a condition characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, which leads to diabetic neuropathy and apoptosis in the spinal cord. Taurine has been found to ameliorate the diabetic neuropathy and control apoptosis in various tissues. However, there are few reports that discuss the direct relationship between spinal cord and anti-apoptotic effect of taurine. In this study, DM was induced in male SD rats with STZ @ 25 mg/Kg of body weight in combination with high fat diet. After 2 weeks, they were divided into four groups as DM: diabetic rats, T1 (0.5%), T2 (1%) and T3 (2%) taurine solution, while control group was non-diabetic rats (no treatment). The results showed that DM increased apoptosis, decreased phosphorylated Akt and Bad. DM decreased expression of Bcl-2 and increased the Bax. Moreover, the release of cytochrome c into cytosol was increased in DM and activation of caspase-3 was also increased. However, taurine reversed all these abnormal changes in a dose dependent manner. Our results suggested the involvement of Akt/Bad signaling pathway and mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in protective effect of taurine against apoptosis in the spinal cord of diabetic rats. Therefore, taurine may be a potential medicine against diabetic neuropathy by controlling apoptosis.

Dominant collagen XII mutations cause a distal myopathy.||||||||To characterize the natural history and clinical features of myopathies caused by mono-allelic, dominantly acting pathogenic variants in COL12A1.||||Patients with dominant COL12A1-related myopathies were characterized by history and clinical examination, muscle imaging, and genetic analysis. Pathogenicity of the variants was assessed by immunostaining patient-derived dermal fibroblast cultures for collagen XII.||||Four independent families with childhood-onset weakness due to novel, dominantly acting pathogenic variants in COL12A1 were identified. Adult patients exhibited distal-predominant weakness. Three families carried dominantly acting glycine missense variants, and one family had a heterozygous, intragenic, in-frame deletion of exon 52 of COL12A1. All pathogenic variants resulted in increased intracellular retention of collagen XII in patient-derived fibroblasts as well as loss of extracellular, fibrillar collagen XII deposition. Since haploinsufficiency for COL12A1 is largely clinically asymptomatic, we designed and evaluated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that specifically target the mutant allele containing the exon 52 deletion. Immunostaining of the patient fibroblasts treated with the siRNA showed a near complete correction of collagen XII staining patterns.||||This study characterizes a distal myopathy phenotype in adults with dominant COL12A1 pathogenic variants, further defining the phenotypic spectrum and natural history of COL12A1-related myopathies. This work also provides proof of concept of a precision medicine treatment approach by proposing and validating allele-specific knockdown using siRNAs specifically designed to target a patient's dominant COL12A1 disease allele.

Fat-Produced Adipsin Regulates Inflammatory Arthritis.||||||||We explored the relationship of obesity and inflammatory arthritis (IA) by selectively expressing diphtheria toxin in adipose tissue yielding "fat-free" (FF) mice completely lacking white and brown fat. FF mice exhibit systemic neutrophilia and elevated serum acute phase proteins suggesting a predisposition to severe IA. Surprisingly, FF mice are resistant to K/BxN serum-induced IA and attendant bone destruction. Despite robust systemic basal neutrophilia, neutrophil infiltration into joints of FF mice does not occur when challenged with K/BxN serum. Absence of adiponectin, leptin, or both has no effect on joint disease, but deletion of the adipokine adipsin (complement factor D) completely prevents serum-induced IA. Confirming that fat-expressed adipsin modulates the disorder, transplantation of wild-type (WT) adipose tissue into FF mice restores susceptibility to IA, whereas recipients of adipsin-deficient fat remain resistant. Thus, adipose tissue regulates development of IA through a pathway in which adipocytes modify neutrophil responses in distant tissues by producing adipsin.

For men, the aromatase deficiency can cause infertility. In this study, the aim is to investigate the effect of maternal hypothyroidism on offspring testicular morphology and cytochrome-P450-aromatase (P450arom) immunoreactivity.||||Eighteen Wistar albino pregnant rats were divided into three groups, namely A, B and K groups. Hypothyroidism was induced by adding 0.01% of propyl thiouracil (PTU) in drinking water. Hypothyroid mothers, group A: given PTU for 21 days during pregnancy, group B: given PTU for 21 days prior to pregnancy; control mothers, group K, given only water. Hypothyroid and control group mothers' pups at postnatal day (PND) 15 and 60 were sacrificed. We determined immunoreactivity intensity of P450arom and mRNA levels by RT-PCR performed in the testis tissues. ELISA method was used for thyroid function tests for T3, T4 and TSH. Structure of seminiferous tubule was evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining.||||It was seen that the aromatase expression in 15-day-old maternal hypothyroid groups was similar to the one in the control group while there was a decline in the aromatase expression of 60-day-old groups. As for mRNA, it was determined that it had a tendency to increase over time in all groups but this increase was not significant. The tubule diameter and Johnsen's Testicular Biopsy Score diminished in all hypothyroid groups in comparison to the control group.||||The changes that occur in the early period of testis development due to maternal hypothyroidism negatively affect testis development in the next stages of life. This situation leads to a decline in aromatase expression in the following years.

The expression of PRR14 was measured using immunofluorescence, qRT- PCR and western blot. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were determined by western blot.||||PRR14 was highly expressed in colon cancer tissues, and the expression level was correlated with tumor size, distant metastasis and Tumor Node Metastasis stages. Functional study revealed that downregulation of PRR14 inhibited colon cancer cells growth, migration and invasion. Furthermore, knockdown of PRR14 inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, cell cycle-associated proteins expression and p-AKT level.||||PRR14 may promote the progression and metastasis of colon cancer, and may be a novel prognostic and therapeutic marker for the disease.

We combined mouse models of tobacco carcinogen-induced lung adenocarcinoma, of deficiency of endogenous Spp1 alleles, and of adoptive pulmonary macrophage reconstitution to map the expression of SPP1 and its receptors and determine its impact during carcinogenesis. Co-expression of Spp1 and mutant KrasG12C in benign cells was employed to investigate SPP1/KRAS interactions in oncogenesis. Finally, intratracheal adenovirus encoding Cre recombinase was delivered to LSL.KRASG12D mice lacking endogenous or overexpressing transgenic Spp1 alleles. SPP1 was overexpressed in experimental and human lung adenocarcinoma and portended poor survival. In response to two different smoke carcinogens, Spp1-deficient mice developed fewer and smaller lung adenocarcinoma with decreased cellular survival and angiogenesis. Both lung epithelial- and macrophage-secreted SPP1 drove tumor-associated inflammation, while epithelial SPP1 promoted early tumorigenesis by fostering the survival of KRAS-mutated cells. Finally, loss and overexpression of Spp1 was, respectively, protective and deleterious for mice harboring KRASG12D-driven LADC. Our data support that SPP1 is functionally involved in early stages of airway epithelial carcinogenesis driven by smoking and mutant KRAS and may present an important therapeutic target.

We observed a significant excess of rare protein-truncating variants among ALS cases, and these variants were concentrated in constrained genes. Through gene level analyses, we replicated known ALS genes including SOD1, NEK1 and FUS. We also observed multiple distinct protein-truncating variants in a highly constrained gene, DNAJC7. The signal in DNAJC7 exceeded genome-wide significance, and immunoblotting assays showed depletion of DNAJC7 protein in fibroblasts in a patient with ALS carrying the p.Arg156Ter variant. DNAJC7 encodes a member of the heat-shock protein family, HSP40, which, along with HSP70 proteins, facilitates protein homeostasis, including folding of newly synthesized polypeptides and clearance of degraded proteins. When these processes are not regulated, misfolding and accumulation of aberrant proteins can occur and lead to protein aggregation, which is a pathological hallmark of neurodegeneration.

However, the regulation of HIF-1α still not been fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that the Sine Oculis Homeobox Homolog 4 (SIX4) is up-regulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) and high expression of SIX4 predicts a poor prognosis. Overexpression of SIX4 enhances tumor growth and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, while knockdown of SIX4 inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, we show that SIX4 increases the expression of VEGF-A by coordinating with the HIF-1α. Mechanically, we explore that SIX4 up-regulates the expression of HIF-1α depending on Akt activation. Collectively, we demonstrate that SIX4 is functional in regulating tumor angiogenesis and SIX4 might be used as anti-angiogenic therapy in CRC.

WNT5A gene and protein expression in endometrial cancer.||||||||WNT5A (Wnt family member 5A) belongs to the WNT family of secreted signaling glycoproteins that play essential role in developmental, physiological and pathological processes. WNT5A was shown to take part in carcinogenesis process playing both oncogenic and suppressor functions in various types of human malignancies. This study aimed to assess the expression of the WNT5A gene at the mRNA and protein levels in the specimens derived from endometrial cancer (EC) or unchanged control endometrium. The associations between the WNT5A expression levels and clinicopathological characteristics and survival of EC patients were evaluated.||||Total RNA was isolated in order to assess the relative amounts of WNT5A mRNA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) in samples of unchanged endometrial control (n = 8) and tumor samples of EC patients (n = 28). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to determine the presence of WNT5A protein in the sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens derived from unchanged endome-trial controls (n = 6) and EC tumors (n = 19). Significance of differences in WNT5A expression levels between the studied groups of EC patients and correlations between the WNT5A and demographic data, pathological features, hematological parameters and overall survival of the patients were evaluated by statistical analysis.||||The level of WNT5A mRNA was decreased in EC in comparison to unchanged endometrium. WNT5A expression was associated with primary tumor invasion status exhibiting reduced level of transcripts in EC that involved organs beyond the uterus when compared to the uterus-confined cancers. WNT5A immunoreactivity was visualized in the cytoplasm and nuclei of EC cells as well as in the luminal and glandular epithelial cells of unchanged endometrium. WNT5A mRNA expression levels correlated negatively with cytoplasmic, and positively with nuclear immunoreactivity of the WNT5A protein in the EC cells. In addition, the relationships between blood leucocyte count (in particular granulocytes and lymphocytes) of patients with EC and their WNT5A mRNA and protein expression levels were established. A positive correlation between the nuclear immunoexpression of WNT5A protein in the cancer cells in cell nuclei and mean platelet volume in blood was also found.||||The results of the first study of WNT5A expression at the transcript and protein levels indicate that it could be considered as a potential marker of molecular changes that take place during EC development.fcbdec12950d284e23c70bcb4c04bf76f2edcb8cd2256e587c110cba8f2a07f4	H-NMR spectrum of AML with _PROTEIN_, signal shifts of protons in _DISEASE_ were not observed.

Recent studies have reported conflicting results regarding an association between subtypes of monocytes as defined by the expression of these two surface markers in atherosclerosis.||||We investigated subtypes of monocytes in n = 994 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease (CAD). We compared total numbers of monocyte subgroups stratified by tertiles with the occurrence of the pre-defined combined endpoint (non-fatal myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death and non-haemorrhagic cerebral insult). Patients were followed up for a minimum of 52 weeks. Classical risk factors of coronary heart disease were included in multivariate analysis.||||The primary endpoint occurred 134 times at a median time of 34.5 weeks (IR 10.6/59.6). Intermediate (p = 0.813), non-classical (p = 0.725) and the number of total monocytes (p = 0.626) stratified by tertiles showed no significant association with the combined endpoint. However, a higher absolute number of classical monocytes divided in tertiles was associated with incidence of the combined endpoint {T1 = 8.9% vs T2 = 14.2% vs T3 = 16.0% (p = 0.021)}. When comparing the third with the first tertile of Mo1 population, multivariate analysis showed a hazard ratio of 1.646 (CI: 1.005-2.699, p = 0.048).||||The absolute counts of classical monocytes divided in tertiles are predictive of major adverse cardiac events in patients with CAD. A tremendous shift from classical to intermediate monocytes was also confirmed in patients with CAD. These data highlight the importance of CD14++ monocytes in cardiovascular diseases.

Protective effect of a novel selective 11β-HSD1 inhibitor on eye ischemia-reperfusion induced glaucoma.||||||||Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness, affecting > 2 million people in the United States. Recently, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) inhibitors were found to exert preventive effects against glaucoma. However, there is no evidence for the role of 11β-HSD1 inhibitors against glaucoma. Here, we developed a novel 11β-HSD1 inhibitor, (1R,2S,3S,5R,6S,7S)-6-(2-(6-(2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-4-methyl-1,1-dioxido-1,2,6-thiadiazinan-2-yl)acetamido)-adamantane-2-carboxamide (KR-67607) and showed its protective effects against ischemia-reperfusion-induced eye injury. We demonstrate that KR-67607 effectively reduced cortisol levels in mouse eyes and maintained the trabecular meshwork (TM) structure in the presence of transient ischemic stress. Furthermore, KR-67607 reversed the elevation of intra-ocular pressure (IOP), suggesting that the TM structure maintained by KR-67607 prevented the excessive rise in IOP that exacerbates glaucoma. KR-67607 was shown to have a higher specificity for 11β-HSD1 than carbenoxolone (CBX) in vitro. Moreover, KR-67607 reduced apoptosis and the structural disruption of TM cells. Antioxidation was the major protective pathway of KR-67607 against chemically-induced ischemia-reperfusion in TM cells and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was closely associated with this pathway. When TM cells undergo ischemic stress, GR is activated and then translocates to the cell nucleus where it interferes with Nrf-2-mediated antioxidant gene expression. However, when KR-67607 inhibited GR translocation, Nrf-2 was able to induce antioxidant gene transcription, which consequently, enhanced the antioxidant capacity of the cells. In conclusion, our current work describes a novel selective 11β-HSD1 inhibitor for glaucoma treatment and provides evidence of its physiological role in anti-oxidative pathways in the TM.

Neointimal hyperplasia: are fatty acid transport proteins a new therapeutic target?||||||||High-fat diets contribute to hyperlipidemia and dysregulated metabolism underlying insulin resistant states and cardiovascular diseases. Neointimal hyperplasia is a significant resulting morbidity. Increased fatty acid (FA) levels lead to dysfunctional endothelium, defined as activated, proinflammatory and prothrombotic. The purpose of this review is to assess the recent literature on the emerging concept that uptake of FA into many tissues is regulated at the endothelial level, and this in turn contributes to endothelial dysfunction, an initiating factor in insulin resistant states, atherosclerosis and neointimal hyperplasia.||||Studies support the role of endothelial FA uptake proteins as an additional level of regulation in tissue FA uptake. These proteins include CD36, FA transport proteins, FA-binding proteins and caveolin-1. In many cases, inappropriate expression of these proteins can result in a change in FA and glucose uptake, storage and utilization. Accumulation of plasma FA is one mechanism by which alterations in expression of FA uptake proteins can lead to endothelial dysfunction; changes in tissue substrate metabolism leading to inflammation are also implicated.||||Identification of the critical players and regulators can lead to therapeutic targeting to reduce endothelial dysfunction and sequela such as insulin resistance and neointimal hyperplasia.

Recombinant annexin A6 promotes membrane repair and protects against muscle injury.||||||||Membrane repair is essential to cell survival. In skeletal muscle, injury often associates with plasma membrane disruption. Additionally, muscular dystrophy is linked to mutations in genes that produce fragile membranes or reduce membrane repair. Methods to enhance repair and reduce susceptibility to injury could benefit muscle in both acute and chronic injury settings. Annexins are a family of membrane-associated Ca2+-binding proteins implicated in repair, and annexin A6 was previously identified as a genetic modifier of muscle injury and disease. Annexin A6 forms the repair cap over the site of membrane disruption. To elucidate how annexins facilitate repair, we visualized annexin cap formation during injury. We found that annexin cap size positively correlated with increasing Ca2+ concentrations. We also found that annexin overexpression promoted external blebs enriched in Ca2+ and correlated with a reduction of intracellular Ca2+ at the injury site. Annexin A6 overexpression reduced membrane injury, consistent with enhanced repair. Treatment with recombinant annexin A6 protected against acute muscle injury in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, administration of recombinant annexin A6 in a model of muscular dystrophy reduced serum creatinine kinase, a biomarker of disease. These data identify annexins as mediators of membrane-associated Ca2+ release during membrane repair and annexin A6 as a therapeutic target to enhance membrane repair capacity.

RhoB and Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) expression were detected by immunohistochemistry in rectal cancer patients who participated in a radiation therapy trial.||||RhoB expression was related to radiation resistance. Complete depletion of the RhoB protein increased radiosensitivity and impaired radiation-enhanced metastatic potential in vitro and in zebrafish models. Probing signaling using mass cytometry-based single-cell analysis showed that the Akt phosphorylation level was inhibited by RhoB depletion after radiation. FOXM1 was downregulated in RhoB knockout cells, and the inhibition of FOXM1 led to lower survival rates and attenuated migration and invasion abilities of the cells after radiation.

Taking a holistic view of PEST-containing nuclear protein (PCNP) in cancer biology.||||||||Polypeptide sequences enriched with proline (P), glutamic acid (E), aspartic acid (D) and serine (S)/ threonine (T) (PEST) have been reported to be the most abundant and frequently distributed at the cellular level. There is growing evidence that PEST sequences act as proteolytic recognition signals for degradation of residual proteins which is critical for activation or deactivation of regulatory proteins involved in cellular signaling pathways of cell growth, differentiation, stress responses and physiological death. A PEST containing nuclear protein (PCNP) was demonstrated as a tumor suppressor in a neuroblastoma cancer model and tumor promoter in lung adenocarcinoma cancer model. Its unique properties like ubiquitination by NIRF, co-localization with NIRF in nucleus and tumor progression attract the attention of researchers. PCNP was reported to be ubiquitinated by ring finger protein NIRF in E3 ligase manner and as modulator of MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. In this review, we summarize PCNP linked DNA damage response, Post translational modifications, and transportation to address initiation, prognosis, and resistance of tumor cells in terms of cell cycle regulation, transcription and apoptosis. Hence, we demonstrate PCNP as a novel target in cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Targeting a ceramide double bond improves insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis.||||||||Ceramides contribute to the lipotoxicity that underlies diabetes, hepatic steatosis, and heart disease. By genetically engineering mice, we deleted the enzyme dihydroceramide desaturase 1 (DES1), which normally inserts a conserved double bond into the backbone of ceramides and other predominant sphingolipids. Ablation of DES1 from whole animals or tissue-specific deletion in the liver and/or adipose tissue resolved hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in mice caused by leptin deficiency or obesogenic diets. Mechanistic studies revealed ceramide actions that promoted lipid uptake and storage and impaired glucose utilization, none of which could be recapitulated by (dihydro)ceramides that lacked the critical double bond. These studies suggest that inhibition of DES1 may provide a means of treating hepatic steatosis and metabolic disorders.

The BMD of mice spine, the serum level of β-CTX and the ALP activity were measured. The expression of SNHG1, JNK, p-JNK, p-38, p-p38 and Osterix were examined by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Co-IP assay was used to verify the effect of SNHG1 on the interaction between p-p38 and Nedd4. Ubiquitination assay was used to evaluate the roles of SNHG1 in ubiquitination of p-p38.||||In the mice with osteoporosis, BMD was decreased and β-CTX concentration and SNHG1 expression were increased. ALP activity and p-p38 protein level were elevated and SNHG1 expression was down-regulated in BMSCs stimulated by osteogenic inducer, while the effects were reversed by SNHG1 over-expression. SNHG1 over-expression enhanced the interaction between Nedd4 and p-p38, disrupted protein stability of p-p38, and promoted the ubiquitination of p-p38. In addition, pcDNA-SNHG1 down-regulated p-p38 protein level, and sh-Nedd4 removed the trend. Nedd4 silencing elevated ALP activity and Osterix protein level, while p-38 inhibitor abrogated the effects. In vivo, SNHG1 silence increased BMD and Osterix protein level, and decreased endogenous SNHG1 expression in mice with OVX.||||This study proved the regulation mechanism that lncRNA SNHG1 negatively regulates p38 MAPK signal pathway through ubiquitination mediated by Nedd4, and thus inhibits osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs.

PIWIL2 stabilizes β-catenin to promote cell cycle and proliferation in tumor cells.||||||||PIWIL2 belongs to the PIWI protein subfamily and is widely expressed in a variety of tumors. Previous studies have shown that PIWIL2 has the characteristics of oncogene. Recently we reported that PIWIL2 suppresses GSK3β activity to regulate circadian rhythms through SRC-PI3K-AKT pathway. As GSK3β is a key part of the β-catenin destruction complex, it plays a vital role in regulating the degradation of β-catenin. Besides, the activated β-catenin/CyclinD1 pathway is involved in the proliferation of tumor cells. It is intriguing to investigate whether PIWIL2 regulates β-catenin and downstream pathway. In this study, we found that PIWIL2 suppressed GSK3β induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination of β-catenin, and thus increased β-catenin accumulation in the nucleus. By up-regulating β-catenin and CyclinD1, PIWIL2 can promote cell cycle and proliferation in tumor cells. Taken together, our results revealed a novel function of PIWIL2 in regulating β-catenin/CyclinD1 pathway in tumor cells, providing a new perspective for PIWIL2 as an oncogene.

EX527, a Sirt-1 inhibitor, induces apoptosis in glioma via activating the p53 signaling pathway.||||||||Sirtuin-1 (Sirt-1), an NAD-dependent deacetylase, promotes tumorigenesis in glioma; however, whether the Sirt-1 specific inhibitor, EX527 exerts antitumor effects and the underlying mechanism in glioma requires further investigation. In the present study, the proliferative and colony formation abilities of two glioma cell lines (U87MG and LN-299) were inhibited by EX527. Treatment with EX527 increased the number of apoptotic cells (Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide); pretreatment with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK suppressed EX527-induced apoptosis, suggesting that EX527 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. In addition, western blotting revealed that EX527 treatment increased the expression of cleaved-caspase-3, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated-X-protein and Bcl-2-like 11 but decreased that of Bcl-2. p53 is deacetylated by Sirt-1, attenuating its function. Furthermore, EX527 upregulated the expression of p53, acetylated p53 and the p53 target gene p21. This result suggests that EX527 induced cell apoptosis by activating p53 in glioma. Of note, EX527 exhibited antitumor effects on patient-derived glioma cells under three-dimensional culture conditions. Collectively, the results of the present study indicated that EX527 may be used as an effective compound in the treatment of glioma.

RESISTIN EFFECT ON TELOMERASE GENE EXPRESSION IN GASTRIC CANCER CELL LINE AGS.||||||||Resistin, as an adipokine, has been shown to be increased in serum plasma of gastric cancer patients and suggested to be a major factor in gastric carcinogenesis. However, it is still not clear how Resistin influences gastric cancer progression. The aim of this study was to evaluate Resistin effect on cell proliferation and expression of telomerase gene in gastric cancer cell line (AGS).||||In this study, the proliferating activity of AGS cells stimulated with Resistin was also evaluated by using 2,3-Bis-(2-Methoxy-4-Nitro-5-Sulfophenyl)-2H-Tetrazolium-5-Carboxanilide (XTT) assay and trypan blue staining method. To investigate telomerase gene expression affected by Resistin, total RNA was extracted, cDNA was synthesized and expression of hTERT mRNA was carried out by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.||||Exogenous Resistin has induced gastric cancer cells proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and could improve cell viability. Also the expression of Human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (hTERT) was upregulated in 24 hours, after Resistin treatment.||||This study has shown Resistin induces exogenously gastric cancer cell proliferation and increases hTERT gene expression. These findings may clarify the role of Resistin in gastric carcinogenesis. Therefore blocking Resistin signaling and limiting its secretion may be valuable for the treatment of gastric cancer.

PAS Domain Containing Repressor 1 (PASD1) Promotes Glioma Cell Proliferation Through Inhibiting Apoptosis In Vitro.||||||||<strong>BACKGROUND</strong> PAS domain containing repressor 1 (PASD1), the cancer-testis antigen (CTA), has been reported to be aberrantly expressed in various cancer tissues and cancer cell lines; however, normal PASD1 expression can be detected in normal tissue, excluding testicular tissue. Moreover, PASD1 is reported to be abnormally expressed in various malignant tumors. However, it remains unclear whether PASD1 participates in tumorigenesis of glioma. <strong>MATERIAL AND METHODS</strong> PASD1 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in 155 glioma tissue specimens in this study. Furthermore, the relationship of PASD1 expression with clinicopathological features in glioma cases was statistically analyzed. In addition, PASD1 was knocked down by small interference RNA (shRNA) in glioma cell line (LN229), so as to assess the potential to use it as the target for treating glioma. <strong>RESULTS</strong> Our findings suggested that PASD1 expression in glioma patients was extremely upregulated compared with that in normal tissue samples and cell lines. Moreover, PASD1 expression was found to be markedly correlated with gender, The World Health Organization grade and p53 expression; in addition, high PASD1 expression indicated poor prognosis for glioma patients. Additionally, downregulation of PASD1 inhibited the proliferation ability of cells and resulted in cell arrest at the G2/M phase, which was achieved through accelerating apoptosis. Furthermore, our results indicated that PASD1 downregulation could upregulate some apoptosis-modulating proteins at the same time it downregulated some cycle-regulating proteins. <strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong> Taken together, our findings demonstrated that PASD1, an oncogene, can potentially serve as an independent prognostic factor for glioma patients.

Genetic Variants on SCN5A, KCNQ1, and KCNH2 in Patients with Ventricular Arrhythmias during Acute Myocardial Infarction in a Chinese Population.||||||||Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. About half of sudden deaths from AMI are mainly because of malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VA) after AMI. The sodium channel gene SCN5A and potassium channel genes KCNQ1 and KCNH2 have been widely reported to be genetic risk factors for arrhythmia including Brugada syndrome and long QT syndrome (LQTS). A few studies reported the association of SCN5A variant with ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) complicating AMI. However, little is known about the role of KCNQ1 and KCNH2 in AMI with VA (AMI_VA). This study focuses on investigating the potential variants on SCN5A, KCNQ1, and KCNH2 contributing to AMI with VA in a Chinese population.||||In total, 139 patients with AMI_VA, and 337 patients with AMI only, were included. Thirty exonic sites were selected to be screened. Sanger sequencing was used to detect variants. A subsequent association study was also performed between AMI_VA and AMI.||||Twelve variants [5 on KCNH2(NM_000238.3), 3 on KCNQ1(NM_000218.2), and 4 on SCN5A(NM_198056.2)] were identified in AMI_VA patients. Only 5 (KCNH2: c.2690A>C; KCNQ1: c.1927G>A, c.1343delC; SCN5A: c.1673A>G, c.3578G>A) of them are missense variants. Two (KCNQ1: c.1343delC and SCN5A: c.3578G>A) of the missense variants were predicted to be clinically pathogenic. All these variants were further genotyped in an AMI without VA group. The association study identified a statistically significant difference in genotype frequency of KCNH2: c.1539C>T and KCNH2: c.1467C>T between the AMI and AMI_VA groups. Moreover, 2 rare variants (KCNQ1: c.1944C>T and SCN5A: c.3621C>T) showed an elevated allelic frequency (more than 1.5-fold) in the AMI_VA group when compared to the AMI group.||||Twelve variants (predicting from benign/VUS to pathogenic) were identified on KCNH2, KCNQ1, and SCN5A in patients with AMI_VA. Genotype frequency comparison between AMI_VA and AMI identified 2 significant common variants on KCNH2. Meanwhile, the allelic frequency of 2 rare variants on KCNQ1 and SCN5A, respectively, were identified to be enriched in AMI_VA, although there was no statistical significance. The present study suggests that the ion-channel genes KCNH2, KCNQ1, and SCN5A may contribute to the pathogenesis of VA during AMI.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were applied to evaluate the bio-molecules expression. Bioinformatics analysis, RNA pull down and luciferase report assay were applied to determine the molecules bind. MTT, transwell, and wound healing assay were used to measure the cell growth situation.||||HOXA11-AS was highly expressed in liver cancer tissues and cell lines, which was closely related with poor prognosis in patients with liver cancer. HOXA11-AS could act as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-15a-3p. Besides, miR-15a-3p negatively controlled its target molecule signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, a linear regression analysis and biological experiments showed a positive correlation between HOAX11-AS and STAT3. Moreover, HOAX11-AS overexpression activated the Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT pathway and thus promoted the growth, migration, and invasion of liver cancer cells, which might be through regulating miR-15a-3p/STAT3 axis.||||Our study suggested that HOAX11-AS could regulate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway by miR-15a-3p/STAT3 axis to promote the progression of liver cancer.

Mutation of the PTCH1 gene predicts recurrence of breast cancer.||||||||Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, and some patients develop recurrence after standard therapy. Effective predictors are urgently needed to detect recurrence earlier. The activation of Hedgehog signaling in breast cancer is correlated with poor prognosis. PTCH1 is an essential membrane receptor of Hedgehog. However, there are few reports about mutations in Hedgehog genes in breast cancer. We conducted a comprehensive study via an experimental and bioinformatics approach to detect mutated genes in breast cancer. Twenty-two breast cancer patients who developed recurrence within 24 months postoperatively were enrolled with 22 control cancer patients. Targeted deep sequencing was performed to assess the mutations among individuals with breast cancer using a panel of 143 cancer-associated genes. Bioinformatics and public databases were used to predict the protein functions of the mutated genes. Mutations were identified in 44 breast cancer specimens, and the most frequently mutated genes were BRCA2, APC, ATM, BRCA1, NF1, TET2, TSC1, TSC2, NOTCH1, MSH2, PTCH1, TP53, PIK3CA, FBXW7, and RB1. Mutation of these genes was correlated with protein phosphorylation and autophosphorylation, such as peptidyl-tyrosine and protein kinase C phosphorylation. Among these highly mutated genes, mutations of PTCH1 were associated with poor prognosis and increased recurrence of breast cancer, especially mutations in exons 22 and 23. The public sequencing data from the COSMIC database were exploited to predict the functions of the mutations. Our findings suggest that mutation of PTCH1 is correlated with early recurrence of breast cancer patients and will become a powerful predictor for recurrence of breast cancer.

Notch1 is a key mediator in multiple human cancer cell types. The association between LPA2 and Notch1 in gastric cancer cells is not well known. The present study aimed to investigate the function of LPA2 and Notch1 in controlling the migration and invasion activities of SGC‑7901 gastric cancer cells following stimulation with LPA. It was revealed that LPA may stimulate the expression of Notch1 and Hes family bHLH transcription factor 1, and the phosphorylation of protein kinase B which belongs to the Notch pathway. Furthermore, by performing transwell migration and invasion assays, immunoﬂuorescent staining, analyzing the expression of markers for the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) and downregulating LPA2 and Notch1 expression, it was verified that LPA2 and Notch1 mediated the metastasis, invasion, EMT and rebuilding of the cytoskeleton of SGC‑7901 cells upon LPA treatment. An immunoprecipitation assay revealed that LPA2 interacted with Notch1 in SGC‑7901 cells. The present study may provide novel ideas and an experimental basis for identifying the factors that affect the functions of SGC‑7901 cells.

It is therefore necessary to develop novel therapies targeting specific events in the pathogenesis of GC. Some hnRNP family members are involved in multiple cancer biological behaviors. However, the potential function and mechanism of hnRNPR, a new molecule of hnRNP family in GC remains unknown. We found that the expression of hnRNPR was significantly overexpressed in multiple cancers compared to the normal tissues. Functionally, hnRNPR promoted cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Knockdown of hnRNPR in two type mice models, with two types of tumors models decreased the tumor aggressiveness and metastasis. Mechanistically, hnRNPR targeted oncogenic pathways by stabilizing the expression of CCNB1 and CENPF mRNA level. Knockdown of CCNB1 and CENPF abolished the hnRNPR-induced cell growth and invasion, respectively. Furthermore, the protein level of hnRNPR in the tumor was positively correlated with the expression of CCNB1 and CENPF in clinical samples. Together, these results indicate that overexpression of hnRNPR promoted the aggressiveness of GC by increasing the mRNA expression of CCNB1 and CENPF. HnRNPR-CCNB1/CENPF axis may be a potential therapeutic target for GC treatment.

While recent genetic and epigenetic studies have reported new insights into the mechanism of retinoblastoma development, the involvement of regulatory non-coding RNAs remains unclear. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a group of endogenous non-protein-coding RNAs with the capacity to regulate gene expression at multiple levels. Recent evidence has shown that lncRNAs can regulate many cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and invasion. Several lncRNAs, including BANCR, AFAP1-AS1, NEAT1, XIST, ANRIL, PlncRNA-1, HOTAIR, PANDAR, DANCR, and THOR, promote the progression and metastasis of retinoblastoma. However, some lncRNAs, such as MEG3, MT1JP, and H19, play a tumor suppressive role.

DNA sequencing was used to assess the genetic factors in the disease etiology. The data revealed a compound heterozygous mutation of CDH23 in both patients. Genetic CDH23 variants are known to be responsible for non‑syndromic hearing loss, and CDH23 variants frequently occur in various populations, including Japanese and Republic of Korean. Results from the present study, indicated a significant contribution of CDH23 variants to the non‑syndromic hearing loss in Chinese patients.

PPA1 promotes NSCLC progression via a JNK- and TP53-dependent manner.||||||||Inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPA1) promotes tumor progression in several tumor types. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we disclosed that PPA1 expression is markedly upregulated in lung carcinoma tissue versus normal lung tissue. We also found that the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines show increased PPA1 expression levels versus normal lung cell line control. Moreover, the knockdown of PPA1 promotes cell apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation. Whereas, the ectopic expression of PPA1 reduces cell apoptosis and enhances cell proliferation. Most interestingly, the expression of mutant PPA1 (D117A) significantly abolishes PPA1-mediated effect on cell apoptosis and proliferation. The underlying mechanism demonstrated that TP53 expression deficiency or JNK inhibitor treatment could abolish PPA1-mediated NSCLC progression. In summary, the aforementioned findings in this study suggest a new pathway the PPA1 mediates NSCLC progression either via TP53 or JNK. Most important, the pyrophosphatase activity is indispensible for PPA1-mediated NSCLC progression. This may provide a promising target for NSCLC therapy.

MiR-155 promotes anaplastic thyroid cancer progression by directly targeting SOCS1.||||||||Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is considered to be a rare type of thyroid cancer but takes up the most important proportion of thyroid cancer-related deaths. Therefore, the development of molecular targeted therapy is an exciting strategy in the management of ATC.||||miR-155 and SOCS1 expression were measured by qRT-PCR as well as western blot analysis. 8305c and FRO cells were transfected and cultured for apoptosis assays, transwell, MTT on miR-155 or SOCS1 suppression and overexpression. Dual-luciferase reporter assays and SOCS1 restoration experimentswas implemented for define the relation between SOCS1 and miR-155. In addition, the correlation between miR-155 expression and patients' clinicopathological features were also explored.||||Aberrant miR-155 and SOCS1 expression and inverse correlation were found in ATC samples. In addition, it indicated that miR-155 expression correlated with cervical metastasis as well as extrathyroidal invasion. Moreover, we demonstrated that miR-155 inhibited 8305c and FRO cells apoptosis, promoted proliferation, invasion and migration. Furthermore, miR-155 inhibition was associated with a significant overexpression of SOCS1. Additionally, luciferase reporter assays presented that miR-155 could bind to SOCS1 3'-UTR, influencing its stability negatively and finally lowering SOCS1 levels. Moreover, it was illustrated that the impacts of miR-155 suppression were reversed by the inhibition of SOCS1 on cell proliferation, apoptosis as well as invasion.||||Aberrant miR-155/SOCS1 expression has been included in ATC progression: miR-155 overexpression leads to SOCS1 suppression and develops ATC progression. Thus, miR-155 has been considered to be an underlying therapeutic target for ATC.

Netrin-1 promotes cell neural invasion in gastric cancer via its receptor neogenin.||||||||Neural invasion (NI) is one of the important routes for local spread of gastric cancer (GC) correlated with poor prognosis. However, the exact cellular characteristics and molecular mechanisms of NI in GC are still unclear. Netrin-1(NTN1) as an axon guidance molecule was firstly found during neural system development. Importantly, NTN1 has an essential role in the progression of malignant tumor and specifically mediates the induction of invasion. In this study, we found NTN1 expression was significantly increased in 97 tumor tissues from GC patients and positively correlated with NI (p<0.05). In addition, we detected NTN1 knockdown significantly suppressed GC cells migration and invasion. Moreover, our results showed that reciprocity was observed between GC cells and neurites colonies in dorsal root ganglia (DRG)-GC cells co-culture vitro model. GC cells with NTN1 silencing could suppress their abilities to navigate along surrounding neuritis and this effect was depended on its receptor neogenin. In vivo, NTN1 inhibition also decreased GC cells sciatic nerve invasion. Taken together, our findings argue that NTN1 and its receptor neogenin might act synergistically in promoting GC cells neural invasion. Inhibiting the activity of NTN1 could be a potential strategy targeting NI in GC therapy.

SOX9-ALDH axis determines resistance to chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.||||||||Chemotherapy resistance and tumor relapse are the major contributors to low patient survival, and both have been largely attributed to cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) or tumor initiating cells (TICs). Moreover, most conventional therapies are not effective against CSCs, which necessitates the discovery of CSC-specific biomarkers and drug targets. Here, we demonstrated that the embryonic transcription factor SOX9 is an important regulator of acquired chemoresistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our results show that SOX9 expression is elevated in NSCLC cells after treatment with the chemotherapeutic cisplatin and that overexpression of SOX9 correlates with worse overall survival in lung cancer patients. We further demonstrated that SOX9 knockdown increases cellular sensitivity to cisplatin, whereas its overexpression promotes drug resistance. Moreover, this transcription factor promotes stem-like properties of NSCLC cells and increases their ALDH activity, which was identified as the key mechanism of SOX9-induced chemoresistance. Finally, we showed that ALDH1A1 is a direct transcriptional target of SOX9 based on chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays. Taken together, our novel findings on the role of SOX9-ALDH axis support the use of this CSC regulator as a prognostic marker of cancer chemoresistance and as a potential drug target for CSC therapy.

Overview of thioredoxin system and targeted therapies for acute leukemia.||||||||The thioredoxin (Trx) system is a major antioxidant system for keeping the intracellular redox state in almost all forms of life, including Trx, Trx reductase (TrxR) and NADPH. It regulates many signaling pathways related to antioxidative action, growth promotion, anti-apoptosis, cell migration, inflammatory modulation, immune function, etc. The oxidative stress has been proved to promote cancer occurrence and the readjustment of Trx system. Considerable results have demonstrated overexpression of Trx in cancer cells, moreover, the overexpression of Trx is closely related to high risk of cancer recurrence and drug resistance. This review focuses on the relationship between Trx system and acute leukemia (AL). The crux of the development of any useful therapy is a knowledge of disease etiology and progression. The potential of thioredoxin system inhibitors as therapeutic agents for acute leukemia is highlighted. Furthermore, targeting Trx as an anti-leukemic strategy is clinically beneficial to AL patients.

The role of SOX18 in bladder cancer and its underlying mechanism in mediating cellular functions.||||||||SRY-box 18 (SOX18) is a transcription factor known for its role in regulating cell differentiation and lymphatic and blood vessel development. It has been reported that SOX18 was involved in various diseases, including cancer. This study aimed to explore the significance and biological function of SOX18 in bladder cancer (BCa).||||SOX18 expression in BCa and normal tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and SOX18 expression in BCa cell lines was quantified by western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR. The role of SOX18 on the proliferation, migration and invasion of BCa cells was explored by CCK-8 and transwell invasion assays in vitro. Cell cycle was measured by flow cytometry assays. Western blotting and qRT-PCR were performed to investigate the potential mechanisms by which SOX18 leads to tumor progression.||||SOX18 was significantly upregulated in BCa and its expression was associated with clinical features of patients with BCa. Our data demonstrated that SOX18 promoted cell proliferation via accelerating cell cycle and by regulating c-Myc and Cyclin D1, promoted cell invasion via upregulation of MMP-7. Moreover, phosphorylation of c-Met and Akt regulated by SOX18 was identified to be involved in the process of cell migration and invasion, indicating the vital role of SOX18 in the metastasis of BCa.||||Our data demonstrated a cancer-promoting effect of SOX18 in BCa, revealed the potential mechanisms of SOX18 in mediating cellular functions, and indicated that SOX18 may serve as a promising progression and prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for BCa.

However, how cancer cells integrate lipid metabolic signaling with cancer progression is not well understood. In the present study, we demonstrated that C/EBPδ, a critical lipid metabolic regulator, is a TGF-β1 downstream gene and promotes lung adenocarcinoma metastasis. Importantly, C/EBPδ caused significant oscillations in both lipid metabolic and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene networks. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that C/EBPδ recruited oncogene NCOA3 to transcriptionally activate Slug, a canonical EMT transcription factor, which in turn induced oxLDL receptor-1 (Lox1) expression and enhanced oxLDL uptake to promote cancer metastasis, which could be blocked with LOX1 neutralizing antibody. In summary, our results unveiled a previously unappreciated interplay between lipid metabolic and metastatic program, as well as the existence of a pivotal C/EBPδ-Slug-Lox1 transcription axis to promote oxLDL levels and cancer metastasis.

Cancer-associated fibroblast-derived Gremlin 1 promotes breast cancer progression.||||||||Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have been reported to maintain epithelial integrity and to antagonize the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The expression of soluble BMP antagonists is dysregulated in cancers and interrupts proper BMP signaling in breast cancer.||||In this study, we mined the prognostic role of BMP antagonists GREMLIN 1 (GREM1) in primary breast cancer tissues using in-house and publicly available datasets. We determined which cells express GREM1 RNA using in situ hybridization (ISH) on a breast cancer tissue microarray. The effects of Grem1 on the properties of breast cancer cells were assessed by measuring the mesenchymal/stem cell marker expression and functional cell-based assays for stemness and invasion. The role of Grem1 in breast cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) activation was measured by analyzing the expression of fibroblast markers, phalloidin staining, and collagen contraction assays. The role of Grem1 in CAF-induced breast cancer cell intravasation and extravasation was studied by utilizing xenograft zebrafish breast cancer (co-) injection models.||||Expression analysis of clinical breast cancer datasets revealed that high expression of GREM1 in breast cancer stroma is correlated with a poor prognosis regardless of the molecular subtype. The large majority of human breast cancer cell lines did not express GREM1 in vitro, but breast CAFs did express GREM1 both in vitro and in vivo. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) secreted by breast cancer cells, and also inflammatory cytokines, stimulated GREM1 expression in CAFs. Grem1 abrogated bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD signaling in breast cancer cells and promoted their mesenchymal phenotype, stemness, and invasion. Moreover, Grem1 production by CAFs strongly promoted the fibrogenic activation of CAFs and promoted breast cancer cell intravasation and extravasation in co-injection xenograft zebrafish models.||||Our results demonstrated that Grem1 is a pivotal factor in the reciprocal interplay between breast cancer cells and CAFs, which promotes cancer cell invasion. Targeting Grem1 could be beneficial in the treatment of breast cancer patients with high Grem1 expression.

CBX4 promotes the proliferation and metastasis via regulating BMI-1 in lung cancer.||||||||Proliferation and metastasis are significantly malignant characteristics of human lung cancer, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Chromobox 4 (CBX4), a member of the Polycomb group (PcG) family of epigenetic regulatory factors, enhances cellular proliferation and promotes cancer cell migration. However, the effect of CBX4 in the progression of lung cancer is not fully understood. We found that CBX4 is highly expressed in lung tumours compared with adjacent normal tissues. Overexpression of CBX4 significantly promotes cell proliferation and migration in human lung cancer cell lines. The knockdown of CBX4 obviously suppresses the cell growth and migration of human lung cancer cells in vitro. Also, the proliferation and metastasis in vivo are blocked by CBX4 knockdown. Furthermore, CBX4 knockdown effectively arrests cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase through suppressing the expression of CDK2 and Cyclin E and decreases the formation of filopodia through suppressing MMP2, MMP9 and CXCR4. Additionally, CBX4 promotes proliferation and metastasis via regulating the expression of BMI-1 which is a significant regulator of proliferation and migration in lung cancer cells. Taken together, these data suggest that CBX4 is not only a novel prognostic marker but also may be a potential therapeutic target in lung cancer.

The Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated that circUBAP2 could bind to microRNA-144. Meanwhile, circUBAP2 negatively regulated microRNA-144 expression in OC cells. Besides, the promotive effects of circUBAP2 on the proliferation and migration of OC cells were reversed by microRNA-144 overexpression. MicroRNA-144 was lowly expressed in OC tissues, which was negatively correlated with TNM stage of OC patients. The Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed the binding condition between CHD2 and microRNA-144. CHD2 expression was negatively regulated by microRNA-144 in OC cells.

We found that KIF4A was dominantly regulated by FOXM1c among the four isoforms, and further identified KIF4A as a direct downstream target of FOXM1c. Inhibiting FOXM1 decreased KIF4A expression in HCC cells, whereas its overexpression had the opposite effect. FOXM1-induced HCC cell proliferation was dependent on elevated KIF4A expression as KIF4A knockdown abolished FOXM1-induced proliferation of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo.||||The FOXM1-KIF4A axis mediates human HCC progression and is a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment.

HOXC10 overexpression promotes cell proliferation and migration in gastric cancer.||||||||Homeodomain‑containing gene 10 (HOXC10) is a member of the homeobox transcription factors that plays an important role in the development of multicellular organisms. HOXC10 is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, and recent studies have revealed that HOXC10 is upregulated in gastric cancer as well. However, its mechanism of action is not fully understood, thus, the role of HOXC10 was investigated in the present study in human gastric cancer. First, HOXC10 expression was revealed to be significantly increased in gastric cancer tissues compared to normal tissues (TCGA dataset), and HOXC10 upregulation was associated with decreased recurrence‑free survival in gastric cancer patients in a public gene expression dataset. HOXC10 promoted cell proliferation and metastasis in two gastric cancer cell lines (AGS and MKN74). Analyzing TCGA 450K DNA methylation dataset, it was revealed that HOXC10 CpG sites were hypomethylated in gastric cancer tissues. Bisulfite sequencing revealed that CpG sites in the HOXC10 first intronic region were hypomethylated in three gastric cancer tissues, and HOXC10 expression was increased in gastric cancer cell lines (AGS and SNU620) in response to 5‑azacytidine treatment. By RNA‑sequencing of AGS cells with ectopic HOXC10 expression, it was revealed that many genes were upregulated by HOXC10 overexpression. Among them, CST1 was predicted to be a HOXC10 direct target gene via prediction of HOXC10 binding sites from the JASPAR database. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that HOXC10 directly bound to CST1 promoter regions. The present study proposes HOXC10 is a potential prognostic marker or therapeutic target in human gastric cancer.
