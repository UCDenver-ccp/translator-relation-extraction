A context-based ABC model for literature-based discovery.||||||||In the literature-based discovery, considerable research has been done based on the ABC model developed by Swanson. ABC model hypothesizes that there is a meaningful relation between entity A extracted from document set 1 and entity C extracted from document set 2 through B entities that appear commonly in both document sets. The results of ABC model are relations among entity A, B, and C, which is referred as paths. A path allows for hypothesizing the relationship between entity A and entity C, or helps discover entity B as a new evidence for the relationship between entity A and entity C. The co-occurrence based approach of ABC model is a well-known approach to automatic hypothesis generation by creating various paths. However, the co-occurrence based ABC model has a limitation, in that biological context is not considered. It focuses only on matching of B entity which commonly appears in relation between two entities. Therefore, the paths extracted by the co-occurrence based ABC model tend to include a lot of irrelevant paths, meaning that expert verification is essential.||||In order to overcome this limitation of the co-occurrence based ABC model, we propose a context-based approach to connecting one entity relation to another, modifying the ABC model using biological contexts. In this study, we defined four biological context elements: cell, drug, disease, and organism. Based on these biological context, we propose two extended ABC models: a context-based ABC model and a context-assignment-based ABC model. In order to measure the performance of the both proposed models, we examined the relevance of the B entities between the well-known relations "APOE-MAPT" as well as "FUS-TARDBP". Each relation means interaction between neurodegenerative disease associated with proteins. The interaction between APOE and MAPT is known to play a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease as APOE affects tau-mediated neurodegeneration. It has been shown that mutation in FUS and TARDBP are associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS), a motor neuron disease by leading to neuronal cell death. Using these two relations, we compared both of proposed models to co-occurrence based ABC model.||||The precision of B entities by co-occurrence based ABC model was 27.1% for "APOE-MAPT" and 22.1% for "FUS-TARDBP", respectively. In context-based ABC model, precision of extracted B entities was 71.4% for "APOE-MAPT", and 77.9% for "FUS-TARDBP". Context-assignment based ABC model achieved 89% and 97.5% precision for the two relations, respectively. Both proposed models achieved a higher precision than co-occurrence-based ABC model.

Further, molecular docking approaches were achieved to endorse and rationalize the biological findings along with envisaging structure-activity relationships. Since the clinical evidence of the last decade has confirmed the correlation between bacterial infections and autoimmune diseases, in this study we have discussed the linkage between infection with Mtb and autoimmune diseases based on previous clinical observations and animal studies. In conclusion, we propose that fucoxanthin could demonstrate great therapeutic value for the treatment of tuberculosis by acting on multiple targets through a bacteriostatic effect as well as by inhibiting UGM and TBNAT. Such outcomes may lead to avoiding or decreasing the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases associated with Mtb infection in a genetically susceptible host.

HPV DNA integration site as proof of the origin of ovarian metastasis from endocervical adenocarcinoma: three case reports.||||||||Most endocervical adenocarcinomas are human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers associated with p16 immunostaining. Ovarian metastasis from cervical cancer is a rare phenomenon, the mechanism of dissemination remains unclear. The diagnosis of metastasis may be difficult to establish when the ovarian neoplasm presents features consistent with primary tumor. Immunohistochemical expression of p16 in ovarian tumors can guide the diagnosis of metastasis from HPV-related cervical cancer, but p16 positivity is nonspecific. Identical HPV genotype in the paired endocervical and ovarian tumors is a better marker for cervical origin, which may also be confirmed by identical HPV integration site.||||Two women presented with HPV18 cervical adenocarcinoma. No signs of disease were visible on MRI after treatment. After several years of follow-up, mucinous ovarian tumors were discovered in both patients. Molecular analyses showed that the ovarian lesions were HPV18-positive; indicating a primary cervical origin. A third woman was diagnosed with grade 1 ovarian endometrioid carcinoma with no peritoneal carcinomatosis. Final histological examination and HPV genotyping revealed HPV18-related in situ endometrioid adenocarcinoma in the endocervix and HPV18-related invasive endometrioid adenocarcinoma in the endometrium and both ovaries. Additional molecular analyses performed in two patients identified the same HPV integration sites in both the ovarian and cervical tumors, confirming that the ovarian mass was a metastasis from the cervical adenocarcinoma.||||We report three new cases of ovarian neoplasia in which the diagnosis of metastasis from cervical cancer was supported by the same HPV genotype and the same integration site in the paired cervical and ovarian tumors. To our knowledge, this is the first report of molecular evidence of the cervical origin of an ovarian metastasis. HPV screening should be performed in ovarian tumors for all patients with history of cervical neoplasia.

[The 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome: a review of recent literature].||||||||The 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome (EMS) is a relatively rare hematological malignancy defined by the presence of chromosomal abnormalities associated with fibroblast growth factor-1 gene, located in the 8p11-12.1 chromosomal locus. To date, only around a hundred cases have been reported in the literature. Patients with EMS present with various forms of myeloid/lymphoid malignancies, such as myeloproliferative neoplasms, acute myeloid leukemia, and T- or B-linage lymphoblastic lymphoma, which are frequently associated with eosinophilia. Prognosis of EMS is poor and a standard treatment strategy has not yet been established. In contrast to myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms associated with PDGFR-A or PDGFR-B rearrangement, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib is not an effective therapeutic option for EMS patients. Other types of TKI, i.e., PKC412, sorafenib, ponatinib, dasatinib, and dovitinib, show growth-inhibitory effects against the cells harboring several types of FGFR-1 fusion genes in in vitro studies; however, the usefulness of either drug has not been confirmed by clinical trials. Therefore, at present, allo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative methods for EMS. Very recently, a phase-2 study with pemigatinib, an inhibitor for FGFR1, showed clinical benefits for EMS patients, including major cytogenetic response, suggesting a new therapeutic option for EMS.

Morule-like Features in Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma Associated with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutations: Two Case Reports with Targeted Next-generation Sequencing Analysis.||||||||Morules, or morule-like features, can be identified in benign and malignant lesions in various organs. Morular features are unusual in pulmonary adenocarcinoma cases with only 26 cases reported to date. Here, we describe two cases of pulmonary adenocarcinoma with morule-like features in Korean women. One patient had a non-mucinous-type adenocarcinoma in situ and the other had an acinar-predominant adenocarcinoma with a micropapillary component. Both patients showed multiple intra-alveolar, nodular, whorled proliferative foci composed of atypical spindle cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm. Targeted next-generation sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of the tumors. Results showed unusual EGFR mutations, which are associated with drug resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, revealing the importance of identifying morule-like features in pulmonary adenocarcinoma and the need for additional study, since there are few reported cases.

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessment of alirocumab in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia associated with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 gain-of-function or apolipoprotein B loss-of-function mutations.||||||||Familial hypercholesterolemia is characterized by high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and causes of familial hypercholesterolemia include apolipoprotein B (APOB) loss-of-function mutations (LOFm) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gain-of-function mutations (GOFm).||||The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alirocumab between patients with APOB LOFm vs PCSK9 GOFm.||||Patients (6 APOB LOFm and 17 PCSK9 GOFm carriers) with LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapies received alirocumab 150 mg at Weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6, placebo at Week 8, alirocumab at Week 10, placebo at Weeks 12 and 14, then completed a follow-up period at Week 22.||||At Week 8, mean ± standard error (SE) alirocumab concentration was lower in APOB LOFm carriers compared with PCSK9 GOFm carriers (12.12 ± 1.81 vs 16.74 ± 2.53 mg/L). APOB LOFm carriers had higher mean ± SE total PCSK9 (6.56 ± 0.73 mg/L) and lower mean ± SE free PCSK9 (0.025 ± 0.016 mg/L) at Week 8 compared with PCSK9 GOFm carriers (4.21 ± 0.35 and 0.11 ± 0.035 mg/L for total and free PCSK9, respectively). Despite this observed greater PCSK9 suppression, mean ± SE percent LDL-C reduction was lower in APOB LOFm (55.3 ± 1.0%) compared with PCSK9 GOFm carriers (73.1 ± 0.9%). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 16 patients (94.1%) in the PCSK9 GOFm group and 5 patients (83.3%) in the APOB LOFm group.||||Overall, PCSK9 inhibition with alirocumab results in clinically meaningful reductions in LDL-C in both APOB LOFm and PCSK9 GOFm carriers, although reductions were greater in the PCSK9 GOFm carriers. The results indicate a possible underlying contributor to hypercholesterolemia other than PCSK9 in patients with APOB LOFm.||||NCT01604824; clinicaltrials.gov.

This study aims to evaluate this score applicability for patients with suspected TTP in a developing country.||||This was a retrospective study performed at a tertiary hospital in the northeastern region of Brazil. Patients were analyzed in two groups: ADAMTS13 activity <10% and activity >10%. Patients were stratified according to the PLASMIC score, and the level of agreement between the PLASMIC score and the ADAMTS13 activity was evaluated.||||Eight patients with thrombotic microangiopathy were included. Four patients had ADAMTS13 activity <10%, all with a PLASMIC score =6. The other four had ADAMTS13 activity >10%, all with a score <6. Based on a score =6 for presumptive diagnosis of TTP, we attained a 100% diagnostic accuracy in our sample. The PLASMIC score was also able to accurately predict response to plasma exchange and the risk of long-term unfavorable outcomes.||||The reproducibility of the PLASMIC score was quite satisfactory in our sample. It accurately discriminates between patients who had ADAMTS13 deficiency and those with normal enzyme activity, precluding the need for specific laboratory evaluation, which is not always available. This score can be useful for an early diagnosis and indicates which patients will benefit from the treatment in developing countries.

Clinical, imaging and follow-up study of optic neuritis associated with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody: a multicentre study of 62 adult patients.||||||||There are few clinico-radiological data on optic neuritis (ON) with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody (MOG-IgG). The objective was to characterize the clinico-radiological phenotype and outcome of patients with MOG-IgG-related ON.||||The records of all adult patients admitted in three medical centres with MOG-IgG-associated ON who underwent orbital and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the acute phase were reviewed. Spinal cord MRI within 1 month from the ON and all of the follow-up MRI were reviewed.||||Of 62 patients, 41.9% had bilateral ON and 66.2% optic disc swelling. On initial MRI, lesions were anterior (92%), extensive (63%) and associated with optic perineuritis (46.6%). Silent brain lesions were found in 51.8% of patients but were mainly non-specific (81%). Of 39 individuals with spinal MRI at onset, nine had abnormal findings (four were asymptomatic). Two symptomatic patients had longitudinally extensive myelitis with concurrent H-sign. At last follow-up, 5% of patients had visual acuity ≤0.1. Brain MRI remained unchanged in 41 patients (87%).||||Our study supports a mostly benign ophthalmological course of MOG-IgG-associated ON, despite initially longitudinally extensive lesions and development of optic nerve atrophy on orbital MRI. Spinal MRI could be of interest in detecting silent suggestive lesions.

All patients suffered from clinical focal status epilepticus. Patients 1 and 2 presented with temporo-mesial seizures in agreement with the definition for limbic encephalitis, whereas Patient 3 presented with neocortical (lateral temporal and frontal lobe) seizures arguing for a non-limbic encephalitis.

Circulating levels of adiponectin, leptin, resistin and visfatin in non-diabetics patients with hidradenitis suppurativa.||||||||Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with insulin resistance (IR), metabolic syndrome and increased cardiovascular risk. Adipokines are biologically active, pleotropic molecules which have been involved in the development of IR and in the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory conditions. The aim of the present study was to analyze serum concentrations of adiponectin, leptin, resistin and visfatin in patients with HS, and investigate their possible associations with IR, HS risk and disease severity. This case-control study enrolled 137 non-diabetic individuals (76 HS-patients and 61 age and sex-matched controls). Serum concentrations of adiponectin, leptin, resistin and visfatin, and the homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) were measured in all the participants. Serum adiponectin concentrations were found to be significantly lower, and leptin, resistin and visfatin levels were significantly higher in HS-patients than in controls. These differences remained significant even after adjusting for age, sex and body mass index, except for leptin. In a multivariate regression analysis, HOMA-IR was inversely correlated with adiponectin and positively associated with resistin levels. Furthermore, serum levels of resistin and visfatin were independently associated with HS risk. However, we found no association between serum levels of adipokines and HS severity. Our results suggest that reduced adiponectin and increased resistin serum levels may be surrogate biomarkers for IR in patients with HS. Moreover, resistin and visfatin might be independent risk factors for the development of HS.

In this retrospective series, we report outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with hematologic disorders associated with SAMD9/SAMD9L mutations. Twelve patients underwent allogeneic HCT for MDS (n = 10), congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (n = 1), and dyskeratosis congenita (n = 1). Exome sequencing revealed heterozygous mutations in SAMD9 (n = 6) or SAMD9L (n = 6) genes. Four SAMD9 patients had features of MIRAGE syndrome. Median age at HCT was 2.8 years (range, 1.2 to 12.8 years). Conditioning was myeloablative in 9 cases and reduced intensity in 3 cases. Syndrome-related comorbidities (diarrhea, infections, adrenal insufficiency, malnutrition, and electrolyte imbalance) were present in MIRAGE syndrome cases. One patient with a familial SAMD9L mutation, MDS, and morbid obesity failed to engraft and died of refractory acute myeloid leukemia. The other 11 patients achieved neutrophil engraftment. Acute post-transplant course was complicated by syndrome-related comorbidities in MIRAGE cases. A patient with SAMD9L-associated MDS died of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The other 10 patients had resolution of hematologic disorder and sustained peripheral blood donor chimerism. Ten of 12 patients were alive with a median follow-up of 3.1 years (range, 0.1 to 14.7 years). More data are needed to refine transplant approaches in SAMD9/SAMD9L patients with significant comorbidities and to develop guidelines for their long-term follow-up.

DICER1 Syndrome.||||||||DICER1 syndrome is an inherited disorder that increases the risk of different types of malignant and benign tumors. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the DICER1 gene, which is located on the long arm of chromosome 14, region q32.13. Patients with DICER1 syndrome commonly develop pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB), multinodular goiter, ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, and/or other types of tumors. In approximately 35% of families with children manifesting PPB, further (and rather rare) malignancies may be observed, including cystic nephroma, nodular dysplasia of the thyroid gland, medulloepithelioma of the iris, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma botryoid type, nasal epithelial hamartoma, pituitary blastoma, and/or pineoblastoma. Large studies report a high variability of tumors associated with DICER1. DICER1 syndrome, which is associated with an inherited predisposition to tumors, is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Symptoms of DICER1 syndrome may vary, even within families. Preventive screening of carriers with causative mutations is complicated. Follow-up is undertaken as recommended by the 2016 International PPB Register.

Split hand/foot malformation with long bone deficiency associated with BHLHA9 gene duplication: a case report and review of literature.||||||||Split hand/foot malformation (SHFM) is a group of congenital skeletal disorders which may occur either as an isolated abnormality or in syndromic forms with extra-limb manifestations. Chromosomal micro-duplication or micro-triplication involving 17p13.3 region has been described as the most common cause of split hand/foot malformation with long bone deficiency (SHFLD) in several different Caucasian and Asian populations. Gene dosage effect of the extra copies of BHLHA9 gene at this locus has been implicated in the pathogenesis of SHFLD.||||The proband was a female child born to non-consanguineous parents. She was referred for genetic evaluation of bilateral asymmetric ectrodactyly involving both hands and right foot along with right tibial hemimelia. The right foot had fixed clubfoot deformity with only 2 toes. The mother had bilateral ectrodactyly involving both hands, but the rest of the upper limbs and both lower limbs were normal. Neither of them had any other congenital malformations or neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Genetic testing for rearrangement of BHLHA9 gene by quantitative polymerase chain reaction confirmed the duplication of the BHLHA9 gene in both the proband and the mother.||||We report the first Sri Lankan family with genetic diagnosis of BHLHA9 duplication causing SHFLD. This report along with the previously reported cases corroborate the possible etiopathogenic role of BHLHA9 gene dosage imbalances in SHFM and SHFLD across different populations.

Endothelial adenosine kinase deficiency ameliorates diet-induced insulin resistance.||||||||Insulin resistance-related disorders are associated with endothelial dysfunction. Accumulating evidence has suggested a role for adenosine signaling in the regulation of endothelial function. Here, we identified a crucial role of endothelial adenosine kinase (ADK) in the regulation of insulin resistance. Feeding mice with a high-fat diet (HFD) markedly enhanced expression of endothelial Adk. Ablation of endothelial Adk in HFD fed mice improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, decreased hepatic steatosis, adipose inflammation, and adiposity, which were associated with improved arteriole vasodilation, decreased inflammation and increased adipose angiogenesis. Mechanistically, ADK inhibition or knockdown in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) elevated intracellular adenosine level and increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) activity, resulting in an increase in nitric oxide (NO) production. Antagonism of adenosine receptor A2b abolished ADK-knockdown- enhanced NOS3 expression in HUVECs. Additionally, increased phosphorylation of NOS3 in ADK-knockdown HUVECs was regulated by an adenosine receptor-independent mechanism. These data suggest that Adk-deficiency-elevated intracellular adenosine in endothelial cells ameliorates diet-induced insulin resistance and metabolic disorders, and this is associated with an enhancement of NO production caused by increased NOS3 expression and activation. Therefore, ADK is a potential target for prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders associated with insulin resistance.

A Case of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma and Kostmann Syndrome: A Genomic Theranostic Approach for Comprehensive Treatment.||||||||BACKGROUND Theranostics is a combined diagnostic and treatment approach to individualized patient care. Kostmann syndrome, or severe congenital neutropenia, is an autosomal recessive disease that affects the production of neutrophils. Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common type of thyroid malignancy associated with gene alterations, including in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway gene. Translocation of the ETS variant 6/neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (ETV6/NTRK3) gene has been implicated in radiation-induced and pediatric forms of thyroid carcinoma but has rarely been described in sporadic PTC. This report is of a case of PTC in a patient with Kostmann syndrome associated with ETV6/NTRK3 gene translocation. CASE REPORT A 32-year-old woman with a history of Kostmann syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) was diagnosed with PTC with cervical lymph node metastases and soft tissue invasion following total thyroidectomy and bilateral modified radical neck dissection. Her postoperative radioactive iodine (RAI) scan confirmed lymph node metastasis. Gene expression studies identified increased expression of iodine-handling genes and ETV6/NTRK3 gene fusion. Because of the bone marrow compromise due to Kostmann syndrome and AML, a careful genomic and molecular analysis was performed to guide therapy. CONCLUSIONS This is the first reported case of the association between PTC, Kostmann syndrome, and ETV6/NTRK3 gene translocation in which multimodality treatment planning was optimized by genomic profiling.

BMP4 mutations in tooth agenesis and low bone mass.||||||||To identify an uncommon genetic cause of tooth agenesis (TA) by utilizing whole exome sequencing (WES) and targeted Sanger sequencing in a cohort of 120 patients with isolated TA.||||One deleterious mutation in the gene encoding bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) was identified in 6 unrelated patients with TA by WES. After that, the coding exons of BMP4 were examined in 114 TA patients using Sanger sequencing. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was used to measure the bone mineral density of patients who carried a BMP4 mutation. Finally, preliminary functional studies of two BMP4 mutants were performed.||||We detected 3 novel missense mutations (c.58 G > A: p.Gly20Ser, c.326 G > T: p.Arg109Leu and c.614 T > C: p.Val205Ala) and 1 reported mutation in the BMP4 gene among 120 TA probands. The previously reported BMP4 mutation (c.751C > T: p.His251Tyr) was associated with urethra and eye anomalies. By extending the pedigrees, we determined that the tooth phenotypes had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, as individuals carrying a BMP4 mutation exhibit different types of dental anomalies. Interestingly, we observed that patients harboring a BMP4 mutation manifested early onset osteopenia or osteoporosis. Further in vitro functional assays demonstrated that two BMP4 mutants resulted in a decreased activation of Smad signaling. Therefore, a loss-of-function in BMP4 may contribute to the clinical phenotypes seen in this study.||||We identified 4 mutations in the BMP4 gene in 120 TA patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe human skeletal diseases associated with BMP4 mutations.

The diagnosis of hATTR was defined by a documented transthyretin mutation through DNA analysis. Symptoms were recorded as present or absent at the time of enrollment into the study. The gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms checklist included the following items: early satiety, nausea, vomiting, constipation, alternating diarrhea/ constipation, diarrhea, fecal incontinence and unintentional weight loss.||||Forty-two patients (53.8%) reported at least one GI symptom or sign. Diarrhea was the most frequently reported (30.8%), followed by unintentional weight loss (28.2%) and nausea (21.8%). Fecal incontinence (3.8%) was the least common one. No significant gender related difference in overall GI symptom prevalence was found (females 52.16%, males 55%, p = 0.834). Type of disease onset was not related to GI prevalence (earlyonset 50%, late-onset 55.6%, p=0.650). After dividing the patients into groups with a disease duration of <5 years, 5-10 years and >10 years, respectively, the prevalence of GI symptoms was found to be significantly higher in later stages (26.3% vs. 55.0% vs. 78.9%, p = 0.005; OR 2.450, 95% CI 1.084-5.538).

These results highlight the importance of a thorough evaluation of the GI function in patients with ATTR amyloidosis and should stimulate further studies on the phenotypic differences related to genotype and geographic origin.

Molecular basis of the scalp-ear-nipple syndrome unraveled by the characterization of disease-causing KCTD1 mutants.||||||||The scalp-ear-nipple (SEN) syndrome is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by cutis aplasia of the scalp and malformations of breast, external ears, digits, and nails. Genetic analyses have shown that the disease is caused by missense mutations of the KCTD1 protein, although the functional/structural basis of SEN insurgence is hitherto unknown. With the aim of unravelling the molecular basis of the SEN syndrome associated with KCTD1 mutations we here expressed and characterized several disease causing mutants. A preliminary dissection of the protein provides insights into the role that individual domains play in KCTD1 stability. The characterization of SEN-causing mutants indicates that, although the mutation sites are located in distant regions of the BTB domain or of the pre-BTB region, all of them are unable to interact with the transcription factor AP-2α, a well-known KCTD1 biological partner. Notably, all mutations, including the one located in the pre-BTB region, produce a significant destabilization of the protein. The structural role of the pre-BTB region in KCTD1 and other proteins of the family is corroborated by its sequence conservation in orthologs and paralogs. Interestingly, SEN-causing mutations also favor the tendency of KCTD1 to adopt structural states that are characterized by the ability to bind the β-amyloid fluorescent dye thioflavin T. The formation of aggregation-prone species may have important implications for the disease etiology. Collectively, these findings provide an intriguing picture of the functional and structural alterations induced by KCTD1 mutations that ultimately lead to disease.

Baicalein suppresses Repeat Tau fibrillization by sequestering oligomers.||||||||Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by protein misfolding, aggregation and accumulation in the brain. A large number of molecules are being screened against these pathogenic proteins but the focus for therapeutics is shifting towards the natural compounds as aggregation inhibitors, mainly due to their minimum adverse effects. Baicalein is a natural compound belonging to the class of flavonoids isolated from the Chinese herb Scutellaria baicalensis. Here we applied fluorescence, absorbance, microscopy, MALDI-TOF spectrophotometry and other biochemical techniques to investigate the interaction between Tau and Baicalein in vitro. We found the aggregation inhibitory properties of Baicalein for the repeat Tau. Overall, the potential of Baicalein in dissolving the preformed Tau oligomers as well as mature fibrils can be of utmost importance in therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease.

Revealing Well-Defined Soluble States during Amyloid Fibril Formation by Multilinear Analysis of NMR Diffusion Data.||||||||Amyloid fibril formation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disease caused by protein aggregation. Oligomeric protein states that arise during the process of fibril formation often coexist with mature fibrils and are known to cause cell death in disease model systems. Progress in this field depends critically on development of analytical methods that can provide information about the mechanisms and species involved in oligomerization and fibril formation. Here, we demonstrate how the powerful combination of diffusion NMR and multilinear data analysis can efficiently disentangle the number of involved species, their kinetic rates of formation or disappearance, spectral contributions, and diffusion coefficients, even without prior knowledge of the time evolution of the process or chemical shift assignments of the various species. Using this method we identify oligomeric species that form transiently during aggregation of human superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), which is known to form misfolded aggregates in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Specifically, over a time course of 42 days, during which SOD1 fibrils form, we detect the disappearance of the native monomeric species, formation of a partially unfolded intermediate in the dimer to tetramer size range, subsequent formation of a distinct similarly sized species that dominates the final spectrum detected by solution NMR, and concomitant appearance of small peptide fragments.

Improving obesity and blood pressure.||||||||Obesity-associated hypertension is a serious public health concern. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity, especially in the kidneys, is an important mechanism linking obesity to hypertension. Some adipokines play important roles in elevating blood pressure (BP). Hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin resistance stimulates sodium reabsorption, enhances sodium retention, and increases circulating plasma volume. Hyperinsulinemia also stimulates both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the SNS, resulting in the acceleration of atherosclerosis through the hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells, which contributes to increased peripheral vascular resistance. Obesity is associated with increased RAAS activity despite volume overload, as the tissue RAASs are stimulated in obese hypertensive individuals. Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated hypertension must also be considered in obese patients with resistant hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Some components of the gut microbiota contribute to BP control; therefore, gut dysbiosis caused by obesity might lead to increased BP. The ratio of visceral fat to subcutaneous fat is higher in Japanese patients than in Caucasian patients, which may explain why Japanese patients are more susceptible to metabolic disorders even though they are less obese than Caucasian individuals. Obesity-associated kidney dysfunction directly increases BP, leading to further deterioration of kidney function. A bodyweight reduction of more than 3% or 5 kg significantly lowers BP. Gastrointestinal bypass surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity and its related metabolic disorders, including hypertension. Because both obesity and hypertension are representative lifestyle-related disorders, lifestyle modification, especially to improve obesity, should be performed first as a treatment for hypertension.

Increasing evidence of hereditary lymphedema caused by CELSR1 loss-of-function variants.||||||||A whole exome sequencing approach was recently used to detect a CELSR1 truncating variant associated with lymphedema in a large pedigree. Since this first report, no other similar associations have been reported in the literature. Here, we present the genetic results of 95 probands tested using a next generation sequencing panel that covered all known lymphedema-associated genes, including CELSR1. Five out of 95 probands (5.3%) were found to carry novel loss-of-function variants in CELSR1. Family segregation studies were possible in four out of five probands and showed possible sex-specific differences: CELSR1 variants showed almost complete penetrance in females and were associated with early-onset lymphedema, whereas in males they showed incomplete penetrance and were associated with late onset of the condition. Since the percentage of lymphedema patients carrying CELSR1 variants is not negligible, we do not hesitate to recommend including this gene in routine genetic testing.

Three primary endpoints: bleeding rate, injection frequency and factor consumption will be used to evaluate treatment outcomes. Enrolment of 175 patients on rFVIIIFc and 175 on conventional products is planned. All eligible patients from participating centres will be invited to participate. Visits and treatments follow routine clinical practice. Bias will be reduced by patient matching for age at baseline and the last weekly prophylaxis dose of a conventional product prior to baseline.

Combined pituitary hormone deficiency caused by PROP1 mutations: update 20 years post-discovery.||||||||The first description of patients with combined pituitary hormone deficiencies (CPHD) caused by PROP1 mutations was made 20 years ago. Here we updated the clinical and genetic characteristics of patients with PROP1 mutations and summarized the phenotypes of 14 patients with 7 different pathogenic PROP1 mutations followed at the Hospital das Clínicas of the University of Sao Paulo. In addition to deficiencies in GH, TSH, PRL and gonadotropins some patients develop late ACTH deficiency. Therefore, patients with PROP1 mutations require permanent surveillance. On magnetic resonance imaging, the pituitary stalk is normal, and the posterior lobe is in the normal position. The anterior lobe in patients with PROP1 mutations is usually hypoplastic but may be normal or even enlarged. Bi-allelic PROP1 mutations are currently the most frequently recognized genetic cause of CPHD worldwide. PROP1 defects occur more frequently among offspring of consanguineous parents and familial cases, but they also occur in sporadic cases, especially in countries in which the prevalence of PROP1 mutations is relatively high. We classified all reported PROP1 variants described to date according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG-AMP) guidelines: 29 were pathogenic, 2 were likely pathogenic, and 2 were of unknown significance. An expansion of the phenotype of patients with PROP1 mutations was observed since the first description 20 years ago: variable anterior pituitary size, different pathogenic mutations, and late development of ACTH deficiency. PROP1 mutations are the most common cause of autosomal recessive CPHD with a topic posterior pituitary lobe. Arch Endocrinol Metab. 2019;63(2):167-74.

Diabetes is a threatening public health concern. It is considered as one of the priority non-communicable diseases, due to its high and increasing incidence, the associated healthcare costs, and threatening medical complications. Two trace elements selenium (Se) and iodine (I) were intensively discussed in the context of diabetic pathology and, possibly, etiology. It seems there is a multilayer involvement of these essential nutrients in glucose tolerance, energy metabolism, insulin signaling and resistance, which are mainly related to the antioxidant selenoenzymes and the thyroid hormones. Other factors might be related to (auto)immunity, protection against endoplasmic reticulum stress, and leptin signaling. The aim of the current review is to evaluate the current understanding of the role of selenium and iodine in diabetes with a focus on the biochemical interplay between the elements, their possible role as biomarkers, and their chemical speciation. Possible impacts from novel analytical techniques related to trace element speciation and isotopic analysis are outlined.

A critical appraisal of the tafazzin knockdown mouse model of Barth syndrome: what have we learned about pathogenesis and potential treatments?||||||||Pediatric heart failure remains poorly understood, distinct in many aspects from adult heart failure. Limited data point to roles of altered mitochondrial functioning and, in particular, changes in mitochondrial lipids, especially cardiolipin. Barth syndrome is a mitochondrial disorder caused by tafazzin mutations that lead to abnormal cardiolipin profiles. Patients are afflicted by cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, neutropenia, and growth delay. A mouse model of Barth syndrome was developed a decade ago, which relies on a doxycycline-inducible short hairpin RNA to knock down expression of tafazzin mRNA (TAZKD). Our objective was to review published data from the TAZKD mouse to determine its contributions to our pathogenetic understanding of, and potential treatment strategies for, Barth syndrome. In regard to the clinical syndrome, the reported physiological, biochemical, and ultrastructural abnormalities of the mouse model mirror those in Barth patients. Using this model, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor pan-agonist bezafibrate has been suggested as potential therapy because it ameliorated the cardiomyopathy in TAZKD mice, while increasing mitochondrial biogenesis. A clinical trial is now underway to test bezafibrate in Barth syndrome patients. Thus the TAZKD mouse model of Barth syndrome has led to important insights into disease pathogenesis and therapeutic targets, which can potentially translate to pediatric heart failure.

DvP-1 is a homogeneous heteropolysaccharide consisting of D-mannose and d-glucose in the molar ration of 10.11: 1. The main glycosidic linkages were β-1, 4-Manp, which were substituted with acetyl groups at the O-2, O-3 and/or O-6 positions. DvP-1 was found to directly stimulate the activation of macrophages in vitro, as evidenced by inducing morphologic change, thereby promoting the production of cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and NO, and enhancing the pinocytic activity of macrophages. By establishing a zebrafish model, we also found that DvP-1 could alleviate vinorelbine-induced decrease of macrophages in vivo. Further findings indicated that DvP-1 activated macrophages through several toll-like receptors (TLRs), but mainly through TLR4. DvP-1 served as a TLR4 agonist and induced ERK, JNK, p38, and IκB-α phosphorylation, suggesting the activation of MAPK and NFκB signaling pathways downstream of TLR4.

Mutations are more often associated with Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy, which are characterized by skeletal muscle weakness or limb girdle dystrophy. However, patients with isolated XLDCM have normal skeletal muscle but complete dystrophin loss in cardiac muscle resulting in isolated myocardial involvement without overt signs of skeletal myopathy.||||A previously well 16-year-old boy developed sudden onset dense left-sided weakness and facial droop. Computed tomography (CT) angiography and CT brain showed an occluded right internal carotid artery extending to the right middle cerebral artery. He underwent successful endovascular clot retrieval but developed frank pulmonary oedema and cardiogenic shock requiring inotropic support and intubation. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated severe left ventricular (LV) cardiomyopathy and an apical thrombus. Subsequent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging confirmed the LV parameters and diffuse late gadolinium enhancement. Despite absence of skeletal manifestations, subsequent genetic testing revealed an X-linked dystrophin gene mutation [c.31+G>T (IVS1G>T)]. He was commenced on empirical heart failure therapy and underwent successful cardiac transplantation.||||X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy is a rare, rapidly progressing cardiomyopathy. Patients show normal skeletal muscle dystrophin but absent expression in cardiac muscle, resulting fibrosis, and atrophy. About 20% of affected young males have significantly reduced survival and thus the diagnosis must be considered in cases of idiopathic cardiomyopathy with CMR and genetic testing key to the diagnosis.

PEHO syndrome caused by compound heterozygote variants in ZNHIT3 gene.||||||||PEHO syndrome is characterized by Progressive Encephalopathy with Edema, Hypsarrhythmia, and Optic atrophy, which was first described in Finnish patients. A homozygous missense substitution p.Ser31Leu in ZNHIT3 was recently identified as the primary cause of PEHO syndrome in Finland. Variants in ZNHIT3 have not been identified in patients with PEHO or PEHO-like syndrome in other populations. It has therefore been suggested that PEHO syndrome caused by ZNHIT3 variants does not occur outside of the Finnish population. We describe the first patient outside Finland who carries compound heterozygous variants in ZNHIT3 gene causing PEHO syndrome. Trio genome sequencing was carried out and the identified variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The patient filled all diagnostic clinical criteria of PEHO syndrome. We identified biallelic missense variants in ZNHIT3 gene: the c.92C > T p.(Ser31Leu) variant (NM_004773.3), which is described previously as causing PEHO syndrome and the second novel variant c.41G > T p.(Cys14Phe). There are only eight heterozygous carriers of c.41G > T variant in the gnomAD database and it is predicted damaging by multiple in silico algorithms. The ZNHIT3-associated PEHO syndrome exists outside of the Finnish population.

A humanized mouse model, demonstrating progressive hearing loss caused by MYO6 p.C442Y, is inherited in a semi-dominant pattern.||||||||Myosin VI is an actin-associated molecular motor vital for auditory and vestibular function. It is encoded by MYO6 located on chromosome 6q13 in human. Pathogenic variants in MYO6 have been associated with both dominant and recessive forms of hearing loss. However, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We established a humanized knock-in mouse model, Myo6-C442Y, to mimic the p.C442Y missense variant identified in human patients with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss designated as DFNA22. We characterized hearing and inner ear morphologies of Myo6-C442Y and wild-type control mice. We found that both homozygous and heterozygous Myo6-C442Y mice exhibited hearing loss from three weeks after birth that rapidly progressed to profound deafness by six to nine weeks of age. The hearing loss corresponded to the degeneration of hair cells in the organ of Corti. We also observed disorganized stereocilia with irregular morphological features by immunohistochemistry and scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, hearing loss and inner-ear morphological anomalies were more pronounced and deteriorated more drastically in homozygous than in heterozygous Myo6-C442Y mice, indicating a semi-dominant inheritance pattern. Heterozygous Myo6-C442Y mice recapitulated the progressive postlingual sensorineural deafness in human, thus providing a useful model for elucidating the role myosin VI plays in the mammalian auditory system. Furthermore, the late-onset hearing loss of this mouse model may provide a therapeutic window for the emerging gene therapy, a promising strategy to treat certain forms of genetic deafness.

Mechanism of atopic cataract caused by eosinophil granule major basic protein.||||||||Atopic cataracts develop under the ages of 40 years, after which visual acuity rapidly declines. However, the mechanism underlying the development of atopic cataracts is not yet clear. We focused on the eosinophil granule major basic protein (MBP), which was detected in the aqueous humor of atopic cataracts previously, and which was cytotoxic. Specifically, we investigated its origin in this fluid and its effects on lens epithelial cells (LECs). MBP immunostaining was positive in atopic cataract-derived LECs, but negative in age-related cataract-derived LECs. MBP mRNA was not detected in either type of cataract, but protein was detected in the aqueous humor. Furthermore, the flare values associated with atopic cataracts were higher than those with age-related cataracts. When MBP was purified from eosinophils or recombinant MBP was added to LEC culture medium, cell viability decreased in a concentration-dependent manner, but an MBP antibody neutralized the cytotoxic effect of this protein towards these cells. These results were consistent with the flow of MBP into the aqueous humor from the blood due to a compromised blood-aqueous barrier. Thus, MBP could further penetrate the lens capsule and adhere to LECs, resulting in decreased cell viability and the development of atopic cataracts.

Towards genomic database of Alexander disease to identify variations modifying disease phenotype.||||||||Alexander disease (AxD) is an extremely rare neurodegenerative disorder caused by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene mutations. Compared with the cerebral type, which is characterized by infantile onset, the bulbospinal type and intermediate form are associated with a late onset, spanning from juveniles to the elderly, and more diverse clinical spectrum, suggesting the existence of factors contributing to phenotypic diversity. To build a foundation for future genetic studies of this rare disease, we obtained genomic data by whole exome-sequencing (WES) and DNA microarray derived from thirty-one AxD patients with the bulbospinal type and intermediate form. Using this data, we aimed to identify genetic variations determining the age at onset (AAO) of AxD. As a result, WES- or microarray-based association studies between younger (<45 years; n = 13)- and older (≥45 years; n = 18)-onset patients considering the predicted GFAP-mutation pathogenicity identified no genome-wide significant variant. The candidate gene approach identified several variants likely correlated with AAO (p < 0.05): GAN, SLC1A2, CASP3, HDACs, and PI3K. Although we need to replicate the results using an independent population, this is the first step towards constructing a database, which may serve as an important tool to advance our understanding of AxD.

[Clinical features of children with lysinuric protein intolerance and SLC7A7 gene mutation: an analysis of 3 cases].||||||||Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by SLC7A7 gene mutation and often involves severe lesions in multiple systems. Lung involvement is frequently seen in children with LPI and such children tend to have a poor prognosis. This article summarizes the clinical manifestations and gene mutation characteristics of three children diagnosed with LPI by SLC7A7 gene analysis. All three children had the manifestations of aversion to protein-rich food after weaning, delayed development, anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and osteoporosis, as well as an increase in orotic acid in urine. In addition, interstitial pneumonia and diffuse pulmonary interstitial lesions were observed in two children. SLC7A7 gene detection showed three pathogenic mutations in these children, namely c.1387delG(p.V463CfsX56), c.1215G>A(p.W405X) and homozygous c.625+1G>A. After a definite diagnosis was made, all three children were given a low-protein diet and oral administration of citrulline [100 mg/(kg.d)], iron protein succinylate [4 mg/(kg.d)], calcium and zinc gluconates oral solution (10 mL/day) and vitamin D (400 IU/day). In addition, patient 3 was given prednisone acetate (5 mg/day). The children had varying degrees of improvement in symptoms and signs. It is hard to distinguish LPI from urea cycle disorder due to the features of amino acid and organic acid metabolism in LPI, and SLC7A7 gene analysis is the basis for a definite diagnosis of LPI.

Characteristics of ventricular tachycardia and long-term treatment outcome in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy complicated by lamin A/C gene mutations.||||||||Dilated cardiomyopathy caused by lamin A/C gene (LMNA) mutation is complicated with atrioventricular (AV) conduction disturbances, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, and progressive severe heart failure. Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) of ventricular tachycardia (VT) has been reported to be challenging due to the high recurrence rate in patients with LMNA-related cardiomyopathy. However, electrophysiological and histopathological characteristics of VT substrate remain to be fully elucidated.||||We experienced 6 familial patients with LMNA-related cardiomyopathy in 3 pedigrees (6 males, 43.7±4.5 [SD] years). All patients had first VT attack at 50±6.6 [SD] years of age, and 4 underwent RFCA for incessant VT. Their electrocardiograms during VT showed similar QRS morphologies, characterized by an inferior axis, SR pattern in aVR, and QS pattern in aVL, suggesting the origin of the basal anterior ventricle. Indeed, the VTs had multiple exits around the basal anterior ventricular septum in all RFCA cases. Although we performed multiple RFCA procedures including epicardial ablation and surgical cryoablation, all cases experienced VT recurrences in 4.5±6.4 [SD] months after last procedure. All patients developed end-stage heart failure with frequent VT events, and died at 59.5±3.6 years of age (severe heart failure in 5 and lung disease in 1). In three autopsy cases with RFCA, fibrofatty degeneration was noted in the AV node. In addition, in the deep basal ventricular septum, inhomogenous fibrotic degenerated tissue was noted beyond the reach of RF lesions.||||These results demonstrate that patients with LMNA-related cardiomyopathy are characterized by VTs refractory to RFCA probably because of the deep intramural focus at the basal ventricular septum, resulting in poor prognosis with progressive severe heart failure despite all available optimized therapies. Thus, we should consider heart transplantation in their early 50s when several VT events begin to occur.

The phenotype of Sotos syndrome in adulthood: A review of 44 individuals.||||||||Sotos syndrome is an overgrowth-intellectual disability (OGID) syndrome caused by NSD1 pathogenic variants and characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, an intellectual disability, tall stature and/or macrocephaly. Other associated clinical features include scoliosis, seizures, renal anomalies, and cardiac anomalies. However, many of the published Sotos syndrome clinical descriptions are based on studies of children; the phenotype in adults with Sotos syndrome is not yet well described. Given that it is now 17 years since disruption of NSD1 was shown to cause Sotos syndrome, many of the children first reported are now adults. It is therefore timely to investigate the phenotype of 44 adults with Sotos syndrome and NSD1 pathogenic variants. We have shown that adults with Sotos syndrome display a wide spectrum of intellectual ability with functioning ranging from fully independent to fully dependent. Reproductive rates are low. In our cohort, median height in adult women is +1.9 SD and men +0.5 SD. There is a distinctive facial appearance in adults with a tall, square, prominent chin.

Diffuse Tract Damage in CADASIL Is Correlated with Global Cognitive Impairment.||||||||Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy -(CADASIL) is the most common familial cerebral small vessel disease caused by notch homolog protein 3 gene mutations and is strongly associated with ischemic stroke and dementia. Patients are characterized by cognitive impairment and widespread white matter (WM) lesions. However, the relationship between WM lesions and cognitive impairment is not very clear. The aim of this study was to investigate WM microstructural abnormalities by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and the relationship between WM alterations and cognitive impairment in patients with CADASIL.||||In the present study, we evaluated WM degeneration in 18 patients with CADASIL and 18 controls by fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD) based on DTI.||||Compared with healthy controls, patients with CADASIL showed extensive and significant reductions in FA and increased RD, AD, and MD. These alterations were distributed throughout the entire brain (mainly the inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, corpus callosum, internal capsule, external capsule, corona radiata, thalamic radiation, and cingulum). Furthermore, these WM microstructural alterations were significantly correlated with cognitive scores and stroke scale scores.||||Patients with -CADASIL showed widespread WM abnormalities, and WM microstructural integrity and cognitive impairment were significantly correlated. Our results indicated that damage to WM tracts plays an important role in cognitive impairment in CADASIL.

[Clinical and genetic features of Mowat-Wilson syndrome: an analysis of 3 cases].||||||||Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease caused by zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) gene mutation and has various clinical manifestations including intellectual disability/global developmental delay, unusual facies and multiple congenital malformations. This article reports the clinical features and gene mutations of three children diagnosed with MWS by ZEB2 gene analysis. All three children had Hirschsprung disease and unusual facies. One child died of severe heart failure and pneumonia at the age of 4 months. Global developmental delay was not discovered by her parents due to her young age. The other two children had severe global developmental delay. All three children carried a de novo heterozygous nonsense mutation in the ZEB2 gene, among which c.756C>A (p.Y252X) had not been reported before. Such mutations produced truncated proteins and were highly pathogenic. MWS is presented with strong clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Clinicians should consider the possibility of MWS when a child has unusual facies of MWS, intellectual disability/global developmental delay and multiple congenital malformations. Gene detection helps to make a confirmed diagnosis.

Biclustering-based association rule mining approach for predicting cancer-associated protein interactions.||||||||Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have been widely used to understand different biological processes and cellular functions associated with several diseases like cancer. Although some cancer-related protein interaction databases are available, lack of experimental data and conflicting PPI data among different available databases have slowed down the cancer research. Therefore, in this study, the authors have focused on various proteins that are directly related to different types of cancer disease. They have prepared a PPI database between cancer-associated proteins with the rest of the human proteins. They have also incorporated the annotation type and direction of each interaction. Subsequently, a biclustering-based association rule mining algorithm is applied to predict new interactions with type and direction. This study shows the prediction power of association rule mining algorithm over the traditional classifier model without choosing a negative data set. The time complexity of the biclustering-based association rule mining is also analysed and compared to traditional association rule mining. The authors are able to discover 38 new PPIs which are not present in the cancer database. The biological relevance of these newly predicted interactions is analysed by published literature. Recognition of such interactions may accelerate a way of developing new drugs to prevent different cancer-related diseases.

Proteogenomic Analysis of Human Colon Cancer Reveals New Therapeutic Opportunities.||||||||We performed the first proteogenomic study on a prospectively collected colon cancer cohort. Comparative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis of paired tumor and normal adjacent tissues produced a catalog of colon cancer-associated proteins and phosphosites, including known and putative new biomarkers, drug targets, and cancer/testis antigens. Proteogenomic integration not only prioritized genomically inferred targets, such as copy-number drivers and mutation-derived neoantigens, but also yielded novel findings. Phosphoproteomics data associated Rb phosphorylation with increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis in colon cancer, which explains why this classical tumor suppressor is amplified in colon tumors and suggests a rationale for targeting Rb phosphorylation in colon cancer. Proteomics identified an association between decreased CD8 T cell infiltration and increased glycolysis in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors, suggesting glycolysis as a potential target to overcome the resistance of MSI-H tumors to immune checkpoint blockade. Proteogenomics presents new avenues for biological discoveries and therapeutic development.

Explore Protein-Protein Interactions for Cancer Target Discovery Using the OncoPPi Portal.||||||||Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) control all functions and physiological states of the cell. Identification and understanding of novel PPIs would facilitate the discovery of new biological models and therapeutic targets for clinical intervention. Numerous resources and PPI databases have been developed to define a global interactome through the PPI data mining, curation, and integration of different types of experimental evidence obtained with various methods in different model systems. On the other hand, the recent advances in cancer genomics and proteomics have revealed a critical role of genomic alterations in acquisition of cancer hallmarks through a dysregulated network of oncogenic PPIs. Deciphering of cancer-specific interactome would uncover new mechanisms of oncogenic signaling for therapeutic interrogation. Toward this goal our team has developed a high-throughput screening platform to detect PPIs between cancer-associated proteins in the context of cancer cells. The established network of oncogenic PPIs, termed the OncoPPi network, is available through the OncoPPi Portal, an interactive web resource that allows to access and interpret a high-quality cancer-focused network of PPIs experimentally detected in cancer cell lines integrated with the analysis of mutual exclusivity of genomic alterations, cellular co-localization of interacting proteins, domain-domain interactions, and therapeutic connectivity. This chapter presents a guide to explore the OncoPPi network using the OncoPPi Portal to facilitate cancer biology.

Ischemia-related changes of fat-mass and obesity-associated protein expression in the gerbil hippocampus.||||||||Fat-mass and obesity-associated protein (Fto) plays important roles in energy metabolism. It also acts as a demethylase and is most abundantly found in the brain. In the present study, we examined the spatial and temporal changes of Fto immunoreactivity after five minutes of transient forebrain ischemia in the hippocampus. In the control group, Fto immunoreactivity was mainly observed in the nucleus of pyramidal cells in the CA1 and CA3 regions as well as the polymorphic layer, granule cell layer, and subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. Fto immunoreactivity was transiently, but not significantly, increased in the hippocampal CA3 region and the dentate gyrus two days after ischemia compared to mice without ischemia in the sham-operated group. Four days after ischemia, low Fto immunoreactivity was observed in the stratum pyramidale of the CA1 region because of neuronal death, but Fto immunoreactive cells were abundantly detected in the stratum pyramidale of the CA3 region, which is relatively resistant to ischemic damage. Thereafter, Fto immunoreactivity progressively decreased in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions and the dentate gyrus until ten days after ischemia. At this time-point, Fto immunoreactivity was significantly lower in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions and the dentate gyrus compared to that in the sham-operated group. The reduction of Fto immunoreactive structures in the hippocampus may be associated with impairments in Fto-related hippocampal function.

Dietary fatty acids from pomegranate seeds (Punica granatum) inhibit adipogenesis and impact the expression of the obesity-associated mRNA transcripts in human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells.||||||||Obesity is a metabolic disorder that manifests into various forms. Recent studies have indicated that the pomegranate (Punica granatum) seed oil (PSO) has many biologically active components that help in controlling diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. However, its impact on the adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HADMSC) remains unclear. Here we have attempted to study the anti-obesity potential of SHAMstat3pg, a fatty acid composite extracted from PSO. It is composed of three dietary fatty acids: punicic acid [(9Z,11E,13Z)-9,11,13-Octadecatrienoic acid], oleic acid [Cis-9-Octadecenoic acid], and linoleic acid [(9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dienoic acid]. In this study, we discuss the impact of the fatty acids on adipogenesis, inflammation, glucose uptake, and mitochondrial ATP production. The impact of SHAMstat3pg on the expression of various obesity-associated protein and mRNA transcripts in HADMSC was also analyzed. The results indicate that exposure to 10 µg/ml of SHAMstat3pg (24 hr) inhibited adipogenesis of HADMSC, ameliorated inflammation, attenuated ATP production, and glucose uptake. Also, the extract favorably regulated the mRNA expression of the studied obesity-associated gene transcripts. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: SHAMstat3pg has the potential to serve as a multi-targeted therapy for the management of obesity. This study demonstrated that the dietary fatty acids inhibited the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes. SHAMstat3pg has also shown to have a favorable impact on the expression of the obesity-linked proteins and genes in HADMSC that are associated with adipogenesis, inflammation, satiety, energy intake/expenditure (central and peripheral signaling molecules). The study gives an overview of the vast number of genes impacted by the treatment with SHAMstat3pg paving the way for future studies to demonstrate the exact mode of action of how dietary fatty acids can help manage obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes.

Lectin-nanoparticle based assays showed 2-10 fold higher signal-to-background ratio compared with lectin-chelate assays. The nanoparticle assay concept allowed surface glycosylation profiling of the urine derived-EVs with lectins. It was also applied to establish an assay showing differential expression of tumor-associated proteins on more aggressive (higher ITGA3 on DU145- and PC3-EVs) compared to less aggressive (higher EpCAM on LNCaP-EVs) PCa- cell lines derived-EVs. This NP-TRFIA can be used as a simple tool for analysis and characterization of EVs in urine and cell culture supernatants. Such approach could be useful in identification of disease-specific markers on the surface of patient-derived urinary EVs.

A basic motif anchoring ISWI to nucleosome acidic patch regulates nucleosome spacing.||||||||Recent studies have implicated the nucleosome acidic patch in the activity of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling machines. We used a photocrosslinking-based nucleosome profiling technology (photoscanning) to identify a conserved basic motif within the catalytic subunit of ISWI remodelers, SNF2h, which engages this nucleosomal epitope. This region of SNF2h is essential for chromatin remodeling activity in a reconstituted biochemical system and in cells. Our studies suggest that the basic motif in SNF2h plays a critical role in anchoring the remodeler to the nucleosomal surface. We also examine the functional consequences of several cancer-associated histone mutations that map to the nucleosome acidic patch. Kinetic studies using physiologically relevant heterotypic nucleosomal substrates ('Janus' nucleosomes) indicate that these cancer-associated mutations can disrupt regularly spaced chromatin structure by inducing ISWI-mediated unidirectional nucleosome sliding. These results indicate a potential mechanistic link between oncogenic histones and alterations to the chromatin landscape.

Felodipine induces autophagy in mouse brains with pharmacokinetics amenable to repurposing.||||||||Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease manifest with the neuronal accumulation of toxic proteins. Since autophagy upregulation enhances the clearance of such proteins and ameliorates their toxicities in animal models, we and others have sought to re-position/re-profile existing compounds used in humans to identify those that may induce autophagy in the brain. A key challenge with this approach is to assess if any hits identified can induce neuronal autophagy at concentrations that would be seen in humans taking the drug for its conventional indication. Here we report that felodipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker and anti-hypertensive drug, induces autophagy and clears diverse aggregate-prone, neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins. Felodipine can clear mutant α-synuclein in mouse brains at plasma concentrations similar to those that would be seen in humans taking the drug. This is associated with neuroprotection in mice, suggesting the promise of this compound for use in neurodegeneration.

Maternal diet is a major determinant of offspring health, and there is strong evidence that maternal HFD alters hypothalamic developmental programming and disrupts offspring energy homeostasis in rodents. In this study, we exposed pregnant and lactating C57BL/6JB female mice to either HFD, HFD with supplemented BCAA (HFD+BCAA), or standard diet (SC), and we studied offspring metabolic phenotypes. Both maternal HFD and HFD supplemented with BCAA had similar effect rendering the offspring metabolic imbalance and impairing their ability to cope with HFD when challenged during aging. The metabolic effects of HFD challenge were more profound in females, worsening female offspring ability to cope with an HFD challenge by activating hypothalamic inflammation in aging. Moreover, the sex differences in hypothalamic estrogen receptor α (ER-α) expression levels were lost in female offspring upon HFD challenge, supporting a link between ER-α levels and hypothalamic inflammation in offspring and highlighting the programming potential of hypothalamic inflammatory responses and maternal nutrition.

HDAC3 Activity is Essential for Human Leukemic Cell Growth and the Expression of β-catenin, MYC, and WT1.||||||||Therapy of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is unsatisfactory. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are active against leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo. Clinical data suggest further testing of such epigenetic drugs and to identify mechanisms and markers for their efficacy. Primary and permanent AML cells were screened for viability, replication stress/DNA damage, and regrowth capacities after single exposures to the clinically used pan-HDACi panobinostat (LBH589), the class I HDACi entinostat/romidepsin (MS-275/FK228), the HDAC3 inhibitor RGFP966, the HDAC6 inhibitor marbostat-100, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) indomethacin, and the replication stress inducer hydroxyurea (HU). Immunoblotting was used to test if HDACi modulate the leukemia-associated transcription factors β-catenin, Wilms tumor (WT1), and myelocytomatosis oncogene (MYC). RNAi was used to delineate how these factors interact. We show that LBH589, MS-275, FK228, RGFP966, and HU induce apoptosis, replication stress/DNA damage, and apoptotic fragmentation of β-catenin. Indomethacin destabilizes β-catenin and potentiates anti-proliferative effects of HDACi. HDACi attenuate WT1 and MYC caspase-dependently and -independently. Genetic experiments reveal a cross-regulation between MYC and WT1 and a regulation of β-catenin by WT1. In conclusion, reduced levels of β-catenin, MYC, and WT1 are molecular markers for the efficacy of HDACi. HDAC3 inhibition induces apoptosis and disrupts tumor-associated protein expression.

[Diagnostic and prognostic roles of serum progranulin, a novel marker of the carbohydrate metabolism and inflammation].||||||||Progranulin is a recently recognized multifunctional glycopeptide shown to be related to obesity and diabetes mellitus. Progranulin is an endogenous antagonist of tumor necrosis factor-α by competitively binding to its receptor, therefore, it exerts anti-inflammatory activity. Paradoxically, previous studies have shown that serum levels of progranulin were elevated in patients with diabetes and associated to its complications including micro- and macroangiopathies, macroalbuminuria or reduced renal function. Moreover, hyperprogranulinemia may be involved in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated insulin resistance. The review summarizes the currently available data on progranulin as a novel marker of the carbohydrate metabolism and inflammation. Orv Hetil. 2019; 160(25): 973-979.

Targeted SHP-1 Silencing Modulates the Macrophage Phenotype, Leading to Metabolic Improvement in Dietary Obese Mice.||||||||Chronic over-nutrition promotes adipocyte hypertrophy that creates inflammatory milieu leading to macrophage infiltration and their phenotypic switching during obesity. The SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) has been identified as an important player in inflammatory diseases involving macrophages. However, the role of SHP-1 in modulating the macrophage phenotype has not been elucidated yet. In the present work, we show that adipose tissue macrophage (ATM)-specific deletion of SHP-1 using glucan particle-loaded siRNA improves the metabolic phenotype in dietary obese insulin-resistant mice. The molecular mechanism involves AT remodeling via reducing crown-like structure formation and balancing the pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory macrophage (M2) population. Therefore, targeting ATM-specific SHP-1 using glucan-particle-loaded SHP-1 antagonists could be of immense therapeutic use for the treatment of obesity-associated insulin resistance.

Insulin resistance mediates high-fat diet-induced pulmonary fibrosis and airway hyperresponsiveness through the TGF-β1 pathway.||||||||Prior studies have reported the presence of lung fibrosis and enhanced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in mice with high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity. This study evaluated the role of TGF-β1 in HFD-induced AHR and lung fibrosis in a murine model. We generated HFD-induced obesity mice and performed glucose and insulin tolerance tests. HFD mice with or without ovalbumin sensitization and challenge were also treated with an anti-TGF-β1 neutralizing antibody. AHR to methacholine, inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and histological features were evaluated. Insulin was intranasally administered to normal diet (ND) mice, and in vitro insulin stimulation of BEAS-2b cells was performed. HFD-induced obesity mice had increased insulin resistance, enhanced AHR, peribronchial and perivascular fibrosis, and increased numbers of macrophages in the BALF. However, they did not have meaningful eosinophilic or neutrophilic inflammation in the lungs compared with ND mice. The HFD enhanced TGF-β1 expression in the bronchial epithelium, but we found no differences in the expression of interleukin (IL)-4 or IL-5 in lung homogenates. Administration of the anti-TGF-β1 antibody attenuated HFD-induced AHR and lung fibrosis. It also attenuated goblet cell hyperplasia, but did not affect the AHR and inflammatory cell infiltration induced by OVA challenge. The intranasal administration of insulin enhanced TGF-β1 expression in the bronchial epithelium and lung fibrosis. Stimulating BEAS-2b cells with insulin also increased TGF-β1 production by 24 h. We concluded that HFD-induced obesity-associated insulin resistance enhances TGF-β1 expression in the bronchial epithelium, which may play an important role in the development of lung fibrosis and AHR in obesity.

Tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells combined with tumor-associated CD68+ macrophages predict postoperative prognosis and adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in resected gastric cancer.||||||||Tumor-infiltrating immune cells are present in various malignant tumors, but their clinical significance in gastric cancer (GC) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs).||||Using a prospective database containing 401 cases of GC, we evaluated TIL (cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) expression) and TAM (cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68) expression) statuses via immunohistochemical staining.||||Compared with CD8+ TIL-negative cases (n = 196, 48.6%), CD8+ TIL-positive cases (n = 205, 51.1%) showed significantly better recurrence-free survival (RFS) [log-rank p<0.001; multivariate HR: 0.372; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.239-0.579, p<0.001]. In contrast, compared with CD68+ TAM-negative cases (n = 217, 54.1%), CD68+ TAM-positive cases (n = 184, 45.9%) had significantly poor RFS [log-rank p<0.001; multivariate HR: 2.182; 95% CI: 1.435-3.318, p<0.001]. Thus, patients with a positive CD8+ TIL and negative CD68+ TAM status exhibited significantly increased RFS. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that CD8+ TILs and CD68+ TAMs may serve as independent prognostic markers for RFS. Incorporating CD8+ TIL and CD68+ TAM statuses into the AJCC TNM system generated a predictive model with better predictive accuracy for RFS. More importantly, patients with a positive TIL and negative TAM status showed a tendency of improved RFS after postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (PAC). Similar results were obtained by overall survival (OS) analysis.||||CD8+ TIL and CD68+ TAM statuses were identified as independent prognostic factors that may be integrated into the current TNM staging system to refine risk stratification and to better predict the survival benefit from PAC in patients with GC.||||The current controlled trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT02327481 ) on December 30, 2014.

CD47 blockade augmentation of Trastuzumab antitumor efficacy dependent upon antibody-dependent-cellular-phagocytosis.||||||||The HER2-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), Trastuzumab, has been the mainstay of therapy for HER2+ breast cancers (BC) for ~20 years. However, its therapeutic mechanism of action (MOA) remains unclear, with antitumor responses to Trastuzumab remaining heterologous and metastatic HER2+ BC remaining incurable. Consequently, understanding its MOA could enable rational strategies to enhance its efficacy. Using both novel murine and human versions of Trastuzumab, we found its antitumor activity dependent on Fcγ-Receptor stimulation of tumor-associated-macrophages (TAM) and Antibody-Dependent-Cellular-Phagocytosis (ADCP), but not cytotoxicity (ADCC). Trastuzumab also stimulated TAM activation and expansion, but did not require adaptive immunity, natural killer cells, and/or neutrophils. Moreover, inhibition of the innate immune ADCP checkpoint, CD47, significantly enhanced Trastuzumab-mediated ADCP, TAM expansion and activation, resulting in the emergence of a unique hyper-phagocytic macrophage population, improved antitumor responses and prolonged survival. In addition, we found tumor-associated CD47 expression was inversely associated with survival in HER2+ BC patients and that human HER2+ BC xenografts treated with Trastuzumab+CD47 inhibition underwent complete tumor regression. Collectively, our study identifies Trastuzumab-mediated ADCP as a significant antitumor MOA that may be clinically enabled by CD47 blockade to augment therapeutic efficacy.

Biochemical diagnostics of pancreatic cancer - Present and future.||||||||Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers having an exceptionally high mortality rate. Despite a relatively low incidence (10th among cancers), it is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in most developed countries. Improving early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and strengthening the standardised comprehensive treatment remain the main focus of pancreatic cancer research. Tumor markers are usually tumor-associated proteins of clinical relevance in these patients. Although tumor markers carbohydrate antigen (CA 19-9) and carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) are commonly used, neither demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy. Recently, hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs) and various enzymes have been reported as potential biomarkers for pancreatic cancer. These include macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), macrophage inhibitory cytokine (MIC-1) and various enzymes (alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, lysosomal exoglycosidases). With the development of molecular technology, detecting K-ras mutation in serum via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is becoming more common and efficient. Because K-ras mutation rates are high in many cancers, some regard it as a potential tumor marker. Others have shown the value of serum miRNAs in detection of pancreatic cancer. Unfortunately, there are currently no effective methods of sufficient diagnostic accuracy to detect early-stage surgically resectable pancreatic cancer. In this article we highlight these biomarkers and summarise recent developments in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer.

Beyond the synucleinopathies: alpha synuclein as a driving force in neurodegenerative comorbidities.||||||||The fundamental role that alpha-synuclein (aSyn) plays in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy, is a well-accepted fact. A wealth of experimental evidence has linked this relatively small but ubiquitously expressed protein to a plethora of cytopathologic mechanisms and suggests that aSyn may be capable of seeding the progressive spread of synucleinopathy throughout the brain. Beyond the synucleinopathies, the abnormal deposition of aSyn is frequently seen in a variety of other neurodegenerative proteinopathies including Alzheimer's disease. In spite of the fact that the frequency of concomitant aSyn pathology in these disorders is such that it can be considered the rule rather than the exception, the potential role that aSyn may have in these disorders has received relatively little attention. In this article we postulate that aSyn may in fact be a key protein in driving the pathogenic processes in neurodegenerative comorbidities. In addition to reviewing the frequency of concomitant deposition of aSyn in the neurodegenerative proteinopathies, we also consider our current understanding of the interaction of aSyn with other neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins, including tau, TDP-43, amyloid-β and prion protein, in the context of neuropathologic studies describing the anatomical sites of potential concomitant pathology. We conclude that a growing body of evidence, encompassing neuropathology studies in human brain, animal models of concomitant proteinopathies and studies employing sophisticated methods of probing protein-protein interaction, cumulatively suggest that aSyn is well positioned to exert a strong influence on the pathogenesis of the neurodegenerative comorbidities. We hope to stimulate research in this emerging field and consider that future studies exploring the contribution of aSyn to the pathogenic processes in neurodegenerative comorbidities may provide critical information pertaining to diagnosis and the development of vital disease modifying treatments for these devastating diseases.

Cell and context-dependent sorting of neuropathy-associated protein NDRG1 - insights from canine tissues and primary Schwann cell cultures.||||||||Mutations in the N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) can cause degenerative polyneuropathy in humans, dogs, and rodents. In humans, this motor and sensory neuropathy is known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4D, and it is assumed that analogous canine diseases can be used as models for this disease. NDRG1 is also regarded as a metastasis-suppressor in several malignancies. The tissue distribution of NDRG1 has been described in humans and rodents, but this has not been studied in the dog.||||By immunolabeling and Western blotting, we present a detailed mapping of NDRG1 in dog tissues and primary canine Schwann cell cultures, with particular emphasis on peripheral nerves. High levels of phosphorylated NDRG1 appear in distinct subcellular localizations of the Schwann cells, suggesting signaling-driven rerouting of the protein. In a nerve from an Alaskan malamute homozygous for the disease-causing Gly98Val mutation in NDRG1, this signal was absent. Furthermore, NDRG1 is present in canine epithelial cells, predominantly in the cytosolic compartment, often with basolateral localization. Constitutive expression also occurs in mesenchymal cells, including developing spermatids that are transiently positive for NDRG1. In some cells, NDRG1 localize to centrosomes.||||Overall, canine NDRG1 shows a cell and context-dependent localization. Our data from peripheral nerves and primary Schwann cell cultures suggest that the subcellular localization of NDRG1 in Schwann cells is dynamically influenced by signaling events leading to reversible phosphorylation of the protein. We propose that disease-causing mutations in NDRG1 can disrupt signaling in myelinating Schwann cells, causing disturbance in myelin homeostasis and axonal-glial cross talk, thereby precipitating polyneuropathy.

Molecular integration of the anti-tropomyosin compound ATM-3507 into the coiled coil overlap region of the cancer-associated Tpm3.1.||||||||H-ATM-3507 is poorly incorporated into preformed Tpm3.1/actin co-polymers. CD spectroscopy and thermal melts using Tpm3.1 peptides containing the C-terminus, the N-terminus, and a combination of the two forming the overlap junction at the interface of adjacent Tpm3.1 dimers, show that ATM-3507 shifts the melting temperature of the C-terminus and the overlap junction, but not the N-terminus. Molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) analysis predicts that ATM-3507 integrates into the 4-helix coiled coil overlap junction and in doing so, likely changes the lateral movement of Tpm3.1 across the actin surface resulting in an alteration of filament interactions with actin binding proteins and myosin motors, consistent with the cellular impact of ATM-3507.

Cancer-associated mutations in human pyruvate kinase M2 impair enzyme activity.||||||||Mammalian pyruvate kinase catalyzes the final step of glycolysis, and its M2 isoform (PKM2) is widely expressed in proliferative tissues. Mutations in PKM2 are found in some human cancers; however, the effects of these mutations on enzyme activity and regulation are unknown. Here, we characterized five cancer-associated PKM2 mutations, occurring at various locations on the enzyme, with respect to substrate kinetics and activation by the allosteric activator fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). The mutants exhibit reduced maximal velocity, reduced substrate affinity, and/or altered activation by FBP. The kinetic parameters of five additional PKM2 mutants that have been used to study enzyme function or regulation also demonstrate the deleterious effects of mutations on PKM2 function. Our findings indicate that PKM2 is sensitive to many amino acid changes and support the hypothesis that decreased PKM2 activity is selected for in rapidly proliferating cells.

Parathyroid Neoplasms: Immunohistochemical Characterization and Long Noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Expression.||||||||Parathyroid adenomas are slow growing benign neoplasms associated with hypercalcemia, while atypical parathyroid adenomas and parathyroid carcinomas are uncommon tumors and their histologic features may overlap with parathyroid adenomas. LncRNAs participate in transcription and in epigenetic or post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, and probably contribute to carcinogenesis. We analyzed a group of normal, hyperplastic, and neoplastic parathyroid lesions to determine the best immunohistochemical markers to characterize these lesions and to determine the role of selected lncRNAs in tumor progression. A tissue microarray consisting of 111 cases of normal parathyroid (n = 14), primary hyperplasia (n = 15), secondary hyperplasia (n = 10), tertiary hyperplasia (n = 11), adenomas (n = 50), atypical adenomas (n = 7), and carcinomas (n = 4) was used. Immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against chromogranin A, synaptophysin, parathyroid hormone, and insulinoma-associated protein 1(INSM1) was used. Expression of lncRNAs including metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript one (MALAT1), HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR), and long intergenic non-protein coding regulator of reprograming (Linc-ROR or ROR) was also analyzed by in situ hybridization and RT-PCR. All of the parathyroid tissues were positive for parathyroid hormone, while most cases were positive for chromogranin A (98%). Synaptophysin was expressed in only 12 cases (11%) and INMS1 was negative in all cases. ROR was significantly downregulated during progression from normal, hyperplastic, and adenomatous parathyroid to parathyroid carcinomas. These results show that parathyroid hormone and chromogranin A are useful markers for parathyroid neoplasms, while synaptophysin and INSM1 are not very sensitive broad-spectrum markers for these neoplasms. LincRNA ROR may function as a tumor suppressor during parathyroid tumor progression.

Functional interrogation of Lynch syndrome-associated MSH2 missense variants via CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in human embryonic stem cells.||||||||Lynch syndrome (LS) predisposes patients to cancer and is caused by germline mutations in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Identifying the deleterious mutation, such as a frameshift or nonsense mutation, is important for confirming an LS diagnosis. However, discovery of a missense variant is often inconclusive. The effects of these variants of uncertain significance (VUS) on disease pathogenesis are unclear, though understanding their impact on protein function can help determine their significance. Laboratory functional studies performed to date have been limited by their artificial nature. We report here an in-cellulo functional assay in which we engineered site-specific MSH2 VUS using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9 gene editing in human embryonic stem cells. This approach introduces the variant into the endogenous MSH2 loci, while simultaneously eliminating the wild-type gene. We characterized the impact of the variants on cellular MMR functions including DNA damage response signaling and the repair of DNA microsatellites. We classified the MMR functional capability of eight of 10 VUS providing valuable information for determining their likelihood of being bona fide pathogenic LS variants. This human cell-based assay system for functional testing of MMR gene VUS will facilitate the identification of high-risk LS patients.

RNAs and RNA-Binding Proteins in Immuno-Metabolic Homeostasis and Diseases.||||||||The increasing prevalence of worldwide obesity has emerged as a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D), hepatosteatosis, and cardiovascular disease. Accumulating evidence indicates that obesity has strong inflammatory underpinnings tightly linked to the development of metabolic diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms by which obesity induces aberrant inflammation associated with metabolic diseases are not yet clearly defined. Recently, RNAs have emerged as important regulators of stress responses and metabolism. RNAs are subject to changes in modification status, higher-order structure, and cellular localization; all of which could affect the affinity for RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and thereby modify the RNA-RBP networks. Proper regulation and management of RNA characteristics are fundamental to cellular and organismal homeostasis, as well as paramount to health. Identification of multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within loci of fat mass- and obesity-associated protein (FTO) gene, an RNA demethylase, through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of T2D, and functional assessments of FTO in mice, support the concept that disruption in RNA modifications leads to the development of human diseases including obesity and metabolic disorder. In obesity, dynamic alterations in modification and localization of RNAs appear to modulate the RNA-RBP networks and activate proinflammatory RBPs, such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR), Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and TLR7, and RNA silencing machinery. These changes induce aberrant inflammation and the development of metabolic diseases. This review will describe the current understanding of the underlying causes of these common and altered characteristics of RNA-RBP networks which will pave the way for developing novel approaches to tackle the pandemic issue of obesity.

P21 and P27 promote tumorigenesis and progression via cell cycle acceleration in seminal vesicles of TRAMP mice.||||||||Transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP) model is established to mimic human prostate cancer progression, where seminal vesicle lesions often occur and has been described as phyllodes-like epithelial-stromal tumors. However, the molecular mechanism regulating tumorigenesis and progression in seminal vesicles of TRAMP mice remains largely unknown. In this study, C57BL/6 TRAMP mice were found to have a significantly shorter lifespan than wild-type (WT) mice and all of the seminal vesicles were markedly increased in size and weight with age from 24 weeks exhibiting a clearly papillary-phyllode pattern, though no obvious difference was observed in multiple organs including heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, testicles and bone between TRAMP and WT mice, and less than 10% of TRAMP mice developed prostate tumors. Western blotting showed Cyclin (CCN) B1 and CCND1 were remarkably overexpressed in seminal vesicle tumors of TRAMP mice at 24 weeks of age and increased with age till the end of trial, which was confirmed by Immunohistochemistry (IHC). P21 and P27 were also significantly augmented, whereas P53 and phosphorylated P53 (p-P53) were constantly expressed in normal controls and P53 did not appear to be mutated. Not only cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 and phosphorylated forkhead box protein (FOX) O1 but also CDK4, CDK6 and phosphorylated retinoblastoma-associated protein (RB) had similar increase trends, so did epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), AKT serine/threonine kinase (AKT), and their respective phosphorylation levels. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, p-STAT3, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and EZH2 mediated trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) were considerably elevated, too. Taken together, this finding suggests P21 and P27 promote carcinogenesis and development in seminal vesicles of TRAMP mice via accelerating cell cycle progression, in which oncogenic transformation of P21 and P27 might be through regulation of EGFR-AKT signaling.

Schnyder corneal dystrophy-associated UBIAD1 mutations cause corneal cholesterol accumulation by stabilizing HMG-CoA reductase.||||||||Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD) is a rare genetic eye disease characterized by corneal opacification resulted from deposition of excess free cholesterol. UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing protein-1 (UBIAD1) is an enzyme catalyzing biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 and vitamin K2. More than 20 UBIAD1 mutations have been found to associate with human SCD. How these mutants contribute to SCD development is not fully understood. Here, we identified HMGCR as a binding partner of UBIAD1 using mass spectrometry. In contrast to the Golgi localization of wild-type UBIAD1, SCD-associated mutants mainly resided in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and competed with Insig-1 for HMGCR binding, thereby preventing HMGCR from degradation and increasing cholesterol biosynthesis. The heterozygous Ubiad1 G184R knock-in (Ubiad1G184R/+) mice expressed elevated levels of HMGCR protein in various tissues. The aged Ubiad1G184R/+ mice exhibited corneal opacification and free cholesterol accumulation, phenocopying clinical manifestations of SCD patients. In summary, these results demonstrate that SCD-associated mutations of UBIAD1 impair its ER-to-Golgi transportation and enhance its interaction with HMGCR. The stabilization of HMGCR by UBIAD1 increases cholesterol biosynthesis and eventually causes cholesterol accumulation in the cornea.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated TDP-43 mutation Q331K prevents nuclear translocation of XRCC4-DNA ligase 4 complex and is linked to genome damage-mediated neuronal apoptosis.||||||||Dominant mutations in the RNA/DNA-binding protein TDP-43 have been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here, we screened genomic DNA extracted from spinal cord specimens of sporadic ALS patients for mutations in the TARDBP gene and identified a patient specimen with previously reported Q331K mutation. The patient spinal cord tissue with Q331K mutation showed accumulation of higher levels of DNA strand breaks and the DNA double-strand break (DSB) marker γH2AX, compared to age-matched controls, suggesting a role of the Q331K mutation in genome-damage accumulation. Using conditional SH-SY5Y lines ectopically expressing wild-type (WT) or Q331K-mutant TDP-43, we confirmed the increased cytosolic sequestration of the poly-ubiquitinated and aggregated form of mutant TDP-43, which correlated with increased genomic DNA strand breaks, activation of the DNA damage response factors phospho-ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), phospho-53BP1, γH2AX and neuronal apoptosis. We recently reported the involvement of WT TDP-43 in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated DSB repair, where it acts as a scaffold for the recruitment of XRCC4-DNA ligase 4 complex. Here, the mutant TDP-43, due to its reduced interaction and enhanced cytosolic mislocalization, prevented the nuclear translocation of XRCC4-DNA ligase 4. Consistently, the mutant cells showed significantly reduced DNA strand break sealing activity and were sensitized to DNA-damaging drugs. In addition, the mutant cells showed elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, suggesting both dominant negative and loss-of-function effects of the mutation. Together, our study uncovered an association of sporadic Q331K mutation with persistent genome damage accumulation due to both damage induction and repair defects.

Loss of BAP1 in Pheochromocytomas and Paragangliomas Seems Unrelated to Genetic Mutations.||||||||Breast cancer-associated protein 1 (BAP1) gene is a broad-spectrum tumor suppressor. Indeed, its loss of expression, due to biallelic inactivating mutations or deletions, has been described in several types of tumors including melanoma, malignant mesothelioma, renal cell carcinoma, and others. There are so far only two reports of BAP1-mutated paraganglioma, suggesting the possible involvement of this gene in paraganglioma (PGL) and pheochromocytoma (PCC) pathogenesis. We assessed BAP1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a cohort of 56 PCC/PGL patients (and corresponding metastases, when available). Confirmatory Sanger sequencing (exons 1-17) of BAP1 has been performed in those samples which resulted negative by IHC. BAP1 nuclear expression was lost in 2/22 (9.1%) PGLs and in 12/34 (35.3%) PCCs, five of which harboring a germline mutation predisposing the development of such tumors (MENIN, MAX, SDHB, SDHD, and RET gene). Confirmatory Sanger sequencing revealed the wild-type BAP1 status of all the analyzed samples. No heterogeneity between primary and metastatic tissue was observed. This study documents that the loss of BAP1 nuclear expression is quite a frequent finding in PCC/PGL, suggesting a possible role of BAP1 in the pathogenesis of these tumors. Gene mutations do not seem to be involved in this loss of expression, at least in most cases. Other genetic and epigenetic mechanisms need to be further investigated.

Prognostic value of ATPase family, AAA+ domain containing 2 expression in human cancers: A systematic review and meta-analysis.||||||||ATPase family, AAA+ domain containing 2 (ATAD2) is also known as AAA+ nuclear coregulator cancer-associated protein or PRO2000. ATAD2 has been reported as a prognostic factor in different cancer types, but the association between ATAD2 high expression and survival is still unclear. Thereby, this meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic value of ATAD2 high expression in human cancers.||||All of the studies included were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library electronic databases. The clinical outcomes were evaluated by calculating hazard ratio (HR) with their 95% confidence interval (CI).||||Thirteen studies including 2689 patients were eligible for this analysis. The pooled results showed that ATAD2 over-expression was significantly associated with shorter overall survival (OS) (HR = 2.32, 95% CI = 1.77-3.02), as well as shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS) (HR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.51-2.23) among human cancers. Subgroup analyses for OS were implemented in terms of region, tumor type, and sample size and the results were coincident with overall pooled results. Begg funnel plot and Egger test showed the presence of publication bias for OS. Sensitivity analysis indicated that both results were not affected for removing any study.||||ATAD2 would be likely to act as a prognostic biomarker for the patients of different cancer types and provide a guide on clinical treatment. Prospective clinical studies are needed to support these findings.

Characterization of cancer-associated IDH2 mutations that differ in tumorigenicity, chemosensitivity and 2-hydroxyglutarate production.||||||||The family of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes is vital for cellular metabolism, as IDH1 and IDH2 are required for the decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate. Heterozygous somatic mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 genes have been detected in many cancers. They share the neomorphic production of the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate [(R)-2-HG]. With respect to IDH2, it is unclear whether all IDH2 mutations display the same or differ in tumorigenic properties and degrees of chemosensitivity. Here, we evaluated the three most frequent IDH2 mutations occurring in cancer. The predicted changes to the enzyme structure introduced by these individual mutations are supported by the observed production of (R)-2-HG. However, their tumorigenic properties, response to chemotherapeutic agents, and baseline activation of STAT3 differed. Paradoxically, the varying levels of endogenous (R)-2-HG produced by each IDH2 mutant inversely correlated with their respective growth rates. Interestingly, while we found that (R)-2-HG stimulated the growth of non-transformed cells, (R)-2-HG also displayed antitumor activity by suppressing the growth of tumors harboring wild type IDH2. The mitogenic effect of (R)-2-HG in immortalized cells could be switched to antiproliferative by transformation with oncogenic RAS. Thus, our findings show that despite their shared (R)-2-HG production, IDH2 mutations are not alike and differ in shaping tumor cell behavior and response to chemotherapeutic agents. Our study also reveals that under certain conditions, (R)-2-HG has antitumor properties.

Kinesin family member 15 promotes cancer stem cell phenotype and malignancy via reactive oxygen species imbalance in hepatocellular carcinoma.||||||||The development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). In the present study, kinesin family member 15 (KIF15) expression was shown to be overexpressed in HCC tissues, cell lines, and CSCs. Patients with HCC with high KIF15 expression had shortened overall survival (OS) and high recurrence probability. Downregulation of KIF15 in vitro as well as in HCC organoids resulted in a significant reduction in sphere formation and expression of stemness-related genes. KIF15 downregulation in human HCC xenograft models delayed tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis. KIF15 was also demonstrated to interact with phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and inhibit proteasomal degradation of PHGDH, thus promoting CSC phenotype and malignancy via PHGDH-mediated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) imbalance in HCC. Moreover, AAA nuclear coregulator cancer-associated protein (ANCCA) upregulation acts as a key mediator in KIF15 expression upregulation in HCC. Conclusion: In this study, we found that KIF15 promotes the CSC phenotype and malignancy via PHGDH-mediated ROS imbalance in HCC. These findings highlight potential therapeutic targets for HCC.

Defective modulation of LINE-1 retrotransposition by cancer-associated SAMHD1 mutants.||||||||Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE-1) is now considered as the only active autonomous mobile DNA in humans, LINE-1 retrotransposition activities are associated with and fluctuate during cancer initiation and progression; however, the mechanism underlying the increased LINE-1 activity in cancer is poorly understood. SAMHD1 has been reported to be a potent inhibitor of LINE-1 retrotransposition, and SAMHD1 mutations are frequently associated with cancer development. To gain insights on whether cancer-related SAMHD1 mutants affect LINE-1 activity, we explored the biochemical and cellular properties of some human mutants known correlate with the development of cancer. Most of the tested SAMHD1 cancer-related mutations were defective in LINE-1 inhibition. Interestingly we also found that SAMHD1 mutant K288T was defective for dNTPase activity but showed potent activity against LINE-1 retrotransposition. These findings suggest that LINE-1 inhibition does not depend solely on the dNTPase activity of SAMHD1. In contrast, SAMHD1's ability to inhibit ORF2p-mediated LINE-1 RNP reverse transcription was correlated with SAMHD1-mediated LINE-1 inhibition. Together, our data could also facilitate the deeper understanding for the inhibition of endogenous LINE-1 elements by SAMHD1.

We examined the role of lncRNA LINC00346, in cutaneous squamous carcinoma (cSCC). The expression of LINC00346 was up-regulated in cSCC cells compared to normal human epidermal keratinocytes. Elevated expression of LINC00346 was noted in tumor cells in cSCC tissue sections in vivo, as compared to cSCC in situ, and actinic keratosis by RNA in situ hybridization, and the expression in seborrheic keratosis and normal skin was very low. Immunohistochemical analysis of cSCC tissue sections and functional assays of cSCC cells in culture showed that LINC00346 expression is down-regulated by p53. Knockdown of LINC00346 inhibited invasion of cSCC cells in culture and suppressed growth of human cSCC xenografts in vivo. Knockdown of LINC00346 inhibited expression of activated STAT3 and resulted in down-regulation of the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-3, MMP-10, and MMP-13. Based on these observations LINC00346 was named p53 regulated carcinoma-associated STAT3-activating long intergenic non-protein coding transcript (PRECSIT). These results identify PRECSIT as a new p53-regulated lncRNA, which promotes progression of cSCC via STAT3 signaling.

Functional interrogation of Lynch syndrome-associated MSH2 missense variants via CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in human embryonic stem cells.||||||||Lynch syndrome (LS) predisposes patients to cancer and is caused by germline mutations in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Identifying the deleterious mutation, such as a frameshift or nonsense mutation, is important for confirming an LS diagnosis. However, discovery of a missense variant is often inconclusive. The effects of these variants of uncertain significance (VUS) on disease pathogenesis are unclear, though understanding their impact on protein function can help determine their significance. Laboratory functional studies performed to date have been limited by their artificial nature. We report here an in-cellulo functional assay in which we engineered site-specific MSH2 VUS using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9 gene editing in human embryonic stem cells. This approach introduces the variant into the endogenous MSH2 loci, while simultaneously eliminating the wild-type gene. We characterized the impact of the variants on cellular MMR functions including DNA damage response signaling and the repair of DNA microsatellites. We classified the MMR functional capability of eight of 10 VUS providing valuable information for determining their likelihood of being bona fide pathogenic LS variants. This human cell-based assay system for functional testing of MMR gene VUS will facilitate the identification of high-risk LS patients.

Cell and context-dependent sorting of neuropathy-associated protein NDRG1 - insights from canine tissues and primary Schwann cell cultures.||||||||Mutations in the N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) can cause degenerative polyneuropathy in humans, dogs, and rodents. In humans, this motor and sensory neuropathy is known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4D, and it is assumed that analogous canine diseases can be used as models for this disease. NDRG1 is also regarded as a metastasis-suppressor in several malignancies. The tissue distribution of NDRG1 has been described in humans and rodents, but this has not been studied in the dog.||||By immunolabeling and Western blotting, we present a detailed mapping of NDRG1 in dog tissues and primary canine Schwann cell cultures, with particular emphasis on peripheral nerves. High levels of phosphorylated NDRG1 appear in distinct subcellular localizations of the Schwann cells, suggesting signaling-driven rerouting of the protein. In a nerve from an Alaskan malamute homozygous for the disease-causing Gly98Val mutation in NDRG1, this signal was absent. Furthermore, NDRG1 is present in canine epithelial cells, predominantly in the cytosolic compartment, often with basolateral localization. Constitutive expression also occurs in mesenchymal cells, including developing spermatids that are transiently positive for NDRG1. In some cells, NDRG1 localize to centrosomes.||||Overall, canine NDRG1 shows a cell and context-dependent localization. Our data from peripheral nerves and primary Schwann cell cultures suggest that the subcellular localization of NDRG1 in Schwann cells is dynamically influenced by signaling events leading to reversible phosphorylation of the protein. We propose that disease-causing mutations in NDRG1 can disrupt signaling in myelinating Schwann cells, causing disturbance in myelin homeostasis and axonal-glial cross talk, thereby precipitating polyneuropathy.

Ischemia-related changes of fat-mass and obesity-associated protein expression in the gerbil hippocampus.||||||||Fat-mass and obesity-associated protein (Fto) plays important roles in energy metabolism. It also acts as a demethylase and is most abundantly found in the brain. In the present study, we examined the spatial and temporal changes of Fto immunoreactivity after five minutes of transient forebrain ischemia in the hippocampus. In the control group, Fto immunoreactivity was mainly observed in the nucleus of pyramidal cells in the CA1 and CA3 regions as well as the polymorphic layer, granule cell layer, and subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. Fto immunoreactivity was transiently, but not significantly, increased in the hippocampal CA3 region and the dentate gyrus two days after ischemia compared to mice without ischemia in the sham-operated group. Four days after ischemia, low Fto immunoreactivity was observed in the stratum pyramidale of the CA1 region because of neuronal death, but Fto immunoreactive cells were abundantly detected in the stratum pyramidale of the CA3 region, which is relatively resistant to ischemic damage. Thereafter, Fto immunoreactivity progressively decreased in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions and the dentate gyrus until ten days after ischemia. At this time-point, Fto immunoreactivity was significantly lower in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions and the dentate gyrus compared to that in the sham-operated group. The reduction of Fto immunoreactive structures in the hippocampus may be associated with impairments in Fto-related hippocampal function.

Hepatocarcinoma-intestine-pancreas/pancreatitis-associated protein (HIP/PAP) confers protection against hepatic fibrosis through downregulation of transforming growth factor β receptor II.|||||||| and BDL liver fibrosis models, adenovirus-mediated ectopic expression of HIP/PAP markedly alleviated liver injury, inflammation, collagen deposition, hepatic stellate cell activation, and the overexpression of profibrotic cytokines, including transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A, B, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), in mice. In vitro experiments demonstrated that, in addition to suppressing hepatic stellate cell proliferation and accelerating hepatocyte proliferation, HIP/PAP mitigated TGF-β1-induced hepatic stellate cell activation, hepatocyte epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and upregulated expression of profibrotic cytokines in both hepatic stellate cells and hepatocytes. Moreover, HIP/PAP attenuated the overexpression of TGF-β receptor II (TGF-βRII) in fibrotic mouse livers and decreased the basal expression of TGF-βRII in nonfibrotic mouse livers as well as in cultured hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells, which is at least partly attributable to the TGF-β1-antagonizing function of HIP/PAP. This study indicates that increased expression of hepatic HIP/PAP serves as a countermeasure against liver injury and fibrosis. Exogenous supplementation of HIP/PAP might be a promising therapeutic agent for hepatic fibrosis as well as liver injury.

Oxytocin in the tumor microenvironment is associated with lower inflammation and longer survival in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer patients.||||||||Prior research demonstrates a protective role for oxytocin in ovarian cancer based on its anti-proliferative, anti-migratory, and anti-invasive effects in vitro and in vivo. However, the role of endogenous oxytocin has not been examined in ovarian cancer patients. Oxytocin also has anti-inflammatory properties that have not been examined in cancer. The purpose of this investigation was to examine relationships between endogenous oxytocin, tumor-associated inflammation (interleukin-6), and survival in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer patients.||||Tumor microenvironment (ascites) and plasma oxytocin levels were analyzed via ELISA on extracted samples obtained from 79 patients. In vitro models were used to characterize oxytocin and oxytocin receptor expression in four ovarian cancer cell lines and to investigate direct anti-inflammatory effects of oxytocin on tumor cell secretion of interleukin-6. High and variable levels of oxytocin were observed in ascites, up to 200 times greater than in plasma. Higher levels of ascites oxytocin were associated with lower levels of systemic and tumor-associated interleukin-6, an inflammatory cytokine implicated in ovarian tumor progression. Oxytocin also attenuated interleukin-6 secretion from multiple ovarian tumor cell lines in vitro. Higher levels of ascites oxytocin were associated with a significant survival advantage and statistical mediation analyses suggested this effect was partially mediated by interleukin-6.||||These data identify a previously unacknowledged hormone in the ovarian tumor microenvironment and provide initial evidence that oxytocin has protective effects in ovarian cancer via anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Future studies should examine the therapeutic utility of oxytocin.

Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma in Remnant Pancreas after Pancreaticoduodenectomy for Acinar Cell Carcinoma: A Case Report.||||||||We report a case of a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in the remnant pancreas of a 78-year-old man after pancreaticoduodenectomy for acinar cell carcinoma, a relatively rare pancreatic neoplasm. After diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma, subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. The pathological diagnosis was acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas (disease stage IA, pT1, pN0, M0), without regional lymph node invasion. Cancer antigen 19-9 levels gradually increased during the 22 months after surgery, and computed tomography showed two solid tumors, 1.1 and 2.1 cm in diameter, at the site of the remnant pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration revealed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The tumor cells were not immunoreactive for trypsin. Both tumors were diagnosed as PDAC of the remnant pancreas. The patient declined curative resection, and chemoradiotherapy was started as alternative treatment. The patient died 28 months after surgery. Because this is an extremely rare case, additional cases and studies are needed in order to clarify its pathogenesis.

Increased heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) serum levels and low NK cell counts after radiotherapy - potential markers for predicting breast cancer recurrence?||||||||Breast cancer is the most common invasive tumor in women worldwide and the second cause of cancer-related deaths. After breast conserving surgery the tumor bed gets irradiated. Radiation-induced tumor cell death has been found to be associated with the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) including free Hsp70 that can stimulate inflammatory immune responses. Therefore, Hsp70 serum levels as well as the composition of lymphocyte subpopulations have been measured in breast cancer patients during therapy and in the follow-up period as potential predictors for clinical outcome.||||The serum of 40 breast cancer patients, who received a breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) was examined for soluble, free Hsp70 using the R&D Human HSP70 DuoSet and lipHsp70 ELISA. Lymphocyte subpopulations and total lymphocyte counts were analysed by multiparameter flow cytometry in the peripheral blood. Blood samples were collected before (t1), after 30 Gy (t2) and 60 Gy (t3), 6 weeks (t4), 6 months (t5) and 1 year (t6) after RT. Clinical responses were assessed regularly up to 5 years after RT.||||Patients who developed a contralateral recurrence or metastases within the first 2 years after RT had significantly higher serum Hsp70 values at the end of RT (t3; p = 0.03) up to 6 weeks after RT (t4; p = 0.007) compared to patients who either remained disease-free or developed a secondary endometrial carcinoma. Clinicopathological parameters such as age, tumor size, grading and TNM-stage of the resected tumors, adjuvant chemotherapy and irradiation dose did not affect serum Hsp70 levels. Elevated free Hsp70 levels might be indicative for a chronic inflammatory response which could support tumor recurrence. Lymphocyte subpopulation analysis revealed lower NK cell counts after RT in recurrence/metastases patients as compared to disease-free patients. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in the proportion of T and B cells.||||Longitudinal elevated serum levels of free Hsp70 up to 6 weeks after RT and dropping NK cell counts might be predictive for an unfavourable prognosis in patients with breast cancer.

Clinical and molecular characteristics of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma not associated with an IgM monoclonal protein: A multicentric study of the Rete Ematologica Lombarda (REL) network.||||||||Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) is usually associated with a serum IgM paraprotein, corresponding to Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (WM). Cases presenting with IgG or IgA, or without a monoclonal protein are extremely rare. We analyzed clinical characteristics, frontline treatment, and the outcome of 45 patients with non-IgM LPL, and compared them with a control group of WM patients. The median age was similar, with significantly higher prevalence of females in non-IgM LPL, than in WM patients (60% vs 39%, P = .016). Patients with non-IgM LPL more frequently presented with lymphadenopathies (53% vs 15%, P < .001), splenomegaly (22% vs 8%, P = .015) or extranodal involvement (20% vs 8%, P = .05). In non-IgM LPL a serum monoclonal protein and bone marrow infiltration were less common than in WM patients (69% and 84% of cases respectively, P < .001 for both comparisons). The MYD88 (L265P) mutation was found in 8/19 patients using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. A CXCR4 mutation was found in 4/17 cases using Sanger. In 16 patients we performed targeted next-generation sequencing of genes MYD88, CXCR4, ARID1-A, KMT2D, NOTCH2, TP53, PRDM1, CD79B, TRAF3, MYBBP1A, TNFAIP3. Seven patients (44%) had a MYD88 mutation (S219C in one), four (25%) a CXCR4 mutation, three (19%) a KMT2D mutation, one (6%) a TP53 mutation and one (6%) a TRAF3 mutation. With a median follow-up of 55.7 months, 36 non-IgM LPL patients (80%) were treated. Non-IgM LPL patients received more frequently anthracycline-containing regimens, as compared with WM patients, who mainly received alkylating-based therapies. Five-year overall survival (OS) was 84%, similar to that of WM patients.

Serum TLR2 and TLR4 levels in colorectal cancer and their association with systemic inflammatory markers, tumor characteristics, and disease outcome.||||||||Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are involved in colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis. However, the significance of serum TLR concentrations in CRC is unknown. We analyzed serum TLR2 and TLR4 concentrations with ELISA in preoperative samples from 118 patients with CRC and 88 matched controls. We also assessed tissue TLR expression with immunohistochemistry and by detecting serum determinants of systemic inflammation. Most participants (>70%) had undetectable serum TLR2. The mean serum TLR4 levels were lower in patients than in controls (1.1 vs 1.8 ng/mL; p = 0.015). Undetectable TLR4 was more common in stage I (39%) than in stages II-IV (11%, p < 0.001). TLR2 or TLR4 expression in tumor cells did not correlate with serum levels, but abundant TLR2 expression in normal colon epithelium was associated with detectable serum TLR2 (p = 0.034). Undetectable serum TLR2 was linked to high modified Glasgow prognostic scores (p = 0.010), high CRP levels (p = 0.013), blood vessel invasion (p = 0.013), and tended to be associated with worse 5-year survival (p = 0.052). In conclusion, serum TLR2 levels were inversely associated with systemic inflammation in patients with CRC. Moreover, serum TLR2 levels might depend more on normal colorectal mucosa contributions than on tumor tissue contributions. Further studies are required to assess the prognostic value of serum TLR2.

Eligibility of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors among patients with diabetes mellitus admitted for heart failure.||||||||Sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure (HF) hospitalization in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and high cardiovascular risk in two large clinical outcome trials: empagliflozin in EMPA-REG OUTCOME and canagliflozin in CANVAS. The scope of eligibility for SGLT-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin and canagliflozin) among patients with type 2 DM and HF, based on clinical trial criteria and current US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labelling criteria, remains unknown.||||Using data from the US Get With The Guidelines (GWTG)-Heart Failure registry, we evaluated the proportion of patients with DM and HF eligible for SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy based on the clinical trial criteria and the US FDA labelling criteria. The GWTG-HF registry is a quality improvement registry of patients admitted in hospital with HF in the USA. We included GWTG-HF registry participants meeting eligibility criteria hospitalized between August 2014 and 30 June 2017 from sites fully participating in the registry. The initial inclusion time point reflects when both drugs had FDA approval. Among the 139 317 patients (out of 407 317) with DM hospitalized with HF (in 460 hospitals; 2014 to 2017), the median age was 71 years, 47% (n = 65 685) were female, and 43% (n = 59 973) had HF with reduced ejection fraction. Overall, 43% (n = 59 943) were eligible for the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, 45% (n = 62 818) were eligible for the CANVAS trial, and 34% (n = 47 747) of patients were eligible for either SGLT-2 inhibitors based on the FDA labelling criteria. Among the FDA-eligible patients, 91.5% (n = 43 708) were eligible for either the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial or the CANVAS trial. Patients who were FDA eligible, compared with those who were not, were younger (70.0 vs. 72.0 years of age), more likely to be male (57.7 vs. 50.3%), and had less burden of co-morbidities.||||The majority of patients with DM who are hospitalized with HF are not eligible for SGLT-2 inhibitor therapies. Ongoing studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors among patients with HF may potentially broaden the population that may benefit from these therapies.

Effect of Diabetes Mellitus on Complication Rates of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting.||||||||Previous studies have shown that diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor for postoperative coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) complications. More contemporary studies are needed to guide revascularization decisions in DM patients. We performed a single-center study of patients who underwent CABG. Patients with no DM were compared with patients with DM, subgrouped according to whether or not DM was treated with insulin before admission (Insulin and No Insulin Groups). Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine whether DM was a significant predictor of mortality, combined postoperative events, and specific postoperative complications after controlling for other predictive clinical variables. Of 11,590 consecutive patients who underwent CABG, 5,013 (43%) had DM and 6,577 (57%) had no DM. Of the patients with DM, 3,433 (68%) were not treated with insulin and 1,580 (32%) were treated with insulin before admission. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that DM was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality or combined postoperative events after considering other clinical variables. The No Insulin Group was significantly associated with stroke, and the Insulin Group was significantly associated with surgical site infection and new renal failure. In conclusion, this study of consecutively treated CABG patients shows that DM is not a predictor of in-hospital mortality or combined in-hospital postoperative events after adjusting for other clinical factors. DM is a predictor of permanent stroke, surgical site infection, and new renal failure. These findings may help with case selection and management of DM patients undergoing CABG.

Several AQP channels were detected in human colon epithelial cells. In a previous study, rats fed 1% (wt/wt) sodium cholate had increased AQP3, 7, and 8 levels, suggesting AQP involvement in bile acid diarrhea (BAD). Our aim was to compare AQP expressions in rectosigmoid mucosal (RSM) biopsies from patients with irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhea (IBS-D) (divided into those with normal or high fecal BA excretion) and in patients with IBS-constipation (IBS-C) compared with healthy controls.||||In RSM biopsies from 44 patients with IBS-D (with normal (<) or high (>2,337 μmol/48 hours (BAD)) fecal BA excretion), 10 patients with IBS-C, and 17 healthy controls, we measured expressions of AQP1, 3, 7, and 8, with RT-PCR (housekeeper gene GAPDH). We analyzed RNA for expression by RT-PCR assays, with expression calculated using 2-based fold-change. Comparisons of IBS groups were corrected for false detection rate (Bonferroni correction for 12 comparisons; P < 0.0042). AQP protein measurements on biopsies from 3 healthy controls, 3 patients with IBS-D, and 3 patients with BAD were performed by western blots (GAPDH housekeeping protein).||||In RSM from patients with IBS-D (but not IBS-C), mRNA expression of AQP3 was decreased, and AQP7 and 8 were increased relative to controls. Fold differences were not different in IBS-D with or without BAD. Western blots confirmed increased expression of AQP7 and 8 and decreased AQP3 proteins in biopsies from patients with IBS-D compared with controls.||||Increased AQP7 and 8 and decreased AQP3 expressions in RSM suggest that further studies on AQPs' potential role in the pathophysiology of diarrhea in IBS-D are warranted.

Interleukin-33 in atopic dermatitis.||||||||Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by pruritus, barrier disruption, and inflammationincluding type 2 cytokine production. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is an inflammatory cytokine that is over-expressed in the keratinocytes of patients with AD. IL-33 transgenic mice, which express IL-33 specifically in keratinocytes, spontaneously develop AD-like eczema, suggesting that IL-33 is sufficient for the development of AD. IL-33 stimulates various cells, including group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), to produce type 2 cytokines, such as IL-5 and IL-13, and IL-33-stimulated basophils activate ILC2s via IL-4. ILC2s are enriched in human AD skin lesions, and ILC2 isolated from AD lesions, are activated by IL-33, not by thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). IL-33 induces IL-31, thereby promoting pruritus and scratching behavior. Conversely, scratching the skin promotes IL-33 release from keratinocytes. IL-33 reduces the expression of filaggrin and claudin-1; it also reduces the skin barrier function. However, barrier destruction causes percutaneous exposure to allergens or IL-33 release. Thus, IL-33 is a common point of entry into the itch-scratch cycle of AD. These new findings can facilitate the development of novel therapeutic drugs targeting IL-33.

Pembrolizumab as first-line treatment for metastatic uveal melanoma.||||||||No standard treatment has been defined for metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM). Although clinical trials testing Nivolumab/Pembrolizumab for cutaneous melanoma did not include mUM, anti PD-1 agents are commonly used for this disease.||||In this prospective observational cohort single arm study, we investigated efficacy and safety of Pembrolizumab as first-line therapy for mUM. The efficacy was evaluated in terms of progression-free survival (PFS), response rate and overall survival (OS). Toxicity was also assessed.||||Seventeen patients were enrolled. A median of 8 cycles were administered (range 2-28). Two patients achieved partial response (11.7%), 6 a disease stabilization (35.3%), whereas 9 (53%) had a progression. No complete response was observed. PFS of the overall population was 3.8 months. PFS was 9.7 months for patients with an interval higher than 5 years from diagnosis of primary tumor to metastatic disease and 2.6 months for patients with an interval lower than 5 years [p = 0.039, HR 0.2865 (95% CI 0.0869-0.9443)]. Median OS was not reached. The two responding patients were still on treatment with Pembrolizumab at the time of data analysis. Survival was 12.8 months for patients with clinical benefit, while OS for progressive patients was 3.1 months. PD-L1 expression and genomic abnormalities predictive of relapse after diagnosis of primary tumor were not associated with PFS. Toxicity was mild, without grade 3-4 side effects.||||The efficacy of Pembrolizumab does not seem particularly different when compared to other agents for mUM, but responding patients had a remarkable disease control.

Preclinical Development of U3-1784, a Novel FGFR4 Antibody Against Cancer, and Avoidance of Its On-target Toxicity.|||||||| The antibody specifically slowed tumor growth of models overexpressing FGF19 by up to 90% whereas tumor growth of models not expressing FGF19 was unaffected. In cynomolgus monkeys, intravenous injection of U3-1784 caused elevated serum bile acid and liver enzyme levels indicating potential liver damage. These effects could be completely prevented by the concomitant oral treatment with the bile acid sequestrant colestyramine, which binds and eliminates bile acids in the gut. These results offer a new biomarker-driven treatment modality in liver cancer without toxicity and they suggest a general strategy for avoiding adverse events with FGFR4 inhibitors.

Markers of endothelial cell activation and neutrophil extracellular traps are elevated in immune thrombocytopenia but are not enhanced by thrombopoietin receptor agonists.||||||||Patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) are at increased risk of thrombosis, which seems to be further enhanced by treatment with thrombopoietin-receptor-agonists (TPO-RAs). The underlying mechanisms of thrombosis in ITP are not fully understood. Endothelial cell activation and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) play important roles in thrombosis, however, their roles in ITP itself, or in TPO-RA-treatment, have not yet been fully explored. We aimed to investigate whether endothelial cell activation and NETs are involved in the hypercoagulable state of ITP, and whether TPO-RA-treatment enhances endothelial cell activation and NET formation.||||We measured markers of endothelial cell activation including intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and thrombomodulin in 21 ITP patients, and E-selectin in 18 ITP patients. Markers of NET formation, citrullinated histone H3-DNA (H3Cit-DNA) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA), were measured in 15 ITP patients. All markers were measured before, and 2 and 6 weeks after initiation of TPO-RA-treatment in ITP patients, and in matched controls.||||Higher levels of ICAM-1, thrombomodulin, and H3Cit-DNA were found in ITP patients, both before and after TPO-RA-treatment, compared with controls. No differences were found for VCAM-1, E-selectin or cfDNA. TPO-RA-treatment did not further increase markers of endothelial cell activation or NET formation.||||This study showed that ITP patients have increased endothelial cell activation and NET formation, both of which may contribute to the intrinsic hypercoagulable state of ITP. TPO-RA-treatment, however, did not further increase endothelial cell activation or NET formation indicating that other drug-associated prothrombotic mechanisms are involved.

Cytoplasmic and membranous receptor-binding cancer antigens expressed on SiSo cells (RCAS1) immunoreactivity in epithelial ovarian cancer cells represent differing biological function of RCAS1.||||||||Receptor-binding cancer antigen expressed on SiSo cells (RCAS1) is a selective suppressor of the immune response that has been linked to the evasion of immune surveillance by cancer cells. However, the exact prognostic impact of RCAS1 on epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) has not been fully elucidated. The main aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of RCAS1 immunoreactivity (RCAS1-Ir) in EOC cells and in tumor stroma cells on patient overall survival. We also focused on RCAS1-Ir and the structure of the tumor stroma.||||RCAS1-Ir was evaluated by means of immunohistochemistry in 67 patients with EOC. We distinguished cytoplasmic and membranous immunoreactivity patterns.||||We found that high cytoplasmic RCAS1-Ir in cancer cells was associated with more than a two-time shortened period of overall survival. Membranous RCAS1-Ir in cancer cells, as well as in tumor stroma macrophages and fibroblasts, did not correlate with patient survival. RCAS1-Ir in the cytoplasm of cancer cells was positively correlated with the degree of tumor stroma infiltration by fibroblasts and macrophages, but not with RCAS1-Ir in these cells. On the other hand, membranous RCAS1-Ir in cancer cells was positively correlated with RCAS1-Ir in fibroblasts and macrophages, but not with their quantity.||||Due to their different impacts on patient prognosis and tumor stroma structure, it seems that cytoplasmic and membranous RCAS1-Ir in EOC cells may have different biological functions.

The aim of the current study is to silence IGF2BP1 in glioma cells by the microRNA (miRNA) strategy. The bio-informatic analyses identified that microRNA-4500 (miR-4500) putatively targets 3'-UTR (3'-untranslated region) of IGF2BP1. In A172 cells and primary human glioma cells ectopic overexpression of the wild-type miR-4500 (but not the mutant form) downregulated IGF2BP1 and its target genes (Gli1, IGF2 and c-Myc). Functional studies show that ectopic miR-4500 overexpression inhibited glioma cell growth, survival, proliferation, migration and invasion. Conversely, in A172 cells miR-4500 inhibition, by a lentiviral construct, increased expression of IGF2BP1 and its targets, promoting cell survival, proliferation and migration. Furthermore, IGF2BP1 knockout by the CRISPR/Cas9 method inhibited A172 cell progression. Significantly, miR-4500 overexpression or miR-4500 inhibition was ineffective in IGF2BP1 knockout A172 cells. At last, we show that miR-4500 levels are downregulated in human glioma tissues, correlating with IGF2BP1 upregulation. Together, we conclude that miR-4500 inhibits human glioma cell progression by targeting IGF2BP1.

Dynamic palmitoylation controls the microdomain localization of the DKK1 receptors CKAP4 and LRP6.||||||||Dickkopf1 (DKK1) was originally identified as an antagonist of Wnt signaling that binds to and induces the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the Wnt coreceptors low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6). DKK1 also binds to cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4), which was originally identified as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein but also functions at the plasma membrane as a receptor for various ligands. The DKK1-CKAP4 pathway is activated in several human cancers and promotes cell proliferation by activating signaling through the kinases PI3K and AKT. We found that both CKAP4 and LRP6 primarily localized to detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fractions of the plasma membrane in a palmitoylation-dependent manner and that palmitoylation of CKAP4 was required for it to promote cell proliferation. DKK1 induced the depalmitoylation of both CKAP4 and LRP6 by acylprotein thioesterases (APTs), resulting in their translocation to the non-DRM fractions. Moreover, DKK1-dependent depalmitoylation of both receptors required activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. DKK1 simultaneously bound CKAP4 and LRP6, resulting in the formation of a ternary complex. LRP5/6 knockdown decreased DKK1-dependent AKT activation and cancer cell proliferation through CKAP4, whereas CKAP4 knockdown did not affect DKK1-dependent inhibition of Wnt signaling through LRP5/6. These results indicate that the palmitoylation states of CKAP4 and LRP6 play important roles in their signaling and that LRP5/6 enhance DKK1-CKAP4 signaling.

Differential Sympathetic Activation of Adipose Tissues by Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor.||||||||Centrally administered brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) decreases body adiposity beyond what can be accounted for by decreased food intake, implying enhanced lipid metabolism by BDNF. Consistent with this notion, intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of BDNF in rats increased the expression of lipolytic enzymes in white adipose tissues (WAT) and increased circulating concentrations of lipolytic products without changing the levels of adrenal gland hormones. This suggests that central BDNF-induced lipid mobilization is likely due to sympathetic neural activation, rather than activation of the adrenocortical or adrenomedullary system. We hypothesized that BDNF activated sympathetic innervation of adipose tissues to regulate lipolysis. Rats with unilateral denervation of interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) and different WAT depots received icv injections of saline or BDNF. Both intact and denervated adipose tissues were exposed to the same circulating factors, but denervated adipose tissues did not receive neural signals. Norepinephrine (NE) turnover (NETO) of BAT and WAT was assessed as a measure of sympathetic activity. Findings revealed that central BDNF treatment induced a change in NETO in some but not all the adipose tissues tested. Specifically, greater NETO rates were found in BAT and gonadal epididymal WAT (EWAT), but not in inguinal WAT (IWAT) or retroperitoneal WAT (RWAT), of BDNF-treated rats compared to saline-treated rats. Furthermore, intact innervation was necessary for BDNF-induced NETO in BAT and EWAT. In addition, BDNF increased the expression of lipolytic enzymes in both intact and denervated EWAT and IWAT, suggesting that BDNF-induced WAT lipolysis was independent of intact innervation. To summarize, centrally administered BDNF selectively provoked sympathetic drives to BAT and EWAT that was dependent on intact innervation, while BDNF also increased lipolysis in a manner independent of intact innervation.

Glucocorticoid-Induced Obesity Develops Independently of UCP1.||||||||An excess of glucocorticoids leads to the development of obesity in both mice and humans, but the mechanism for this is unknown. Here, we determine the extent to which decreased BAT thermogenic capacity (as a result of glucocorticoid treatment) contributes to the development of obesity. Contrary to previous suggestions, we show that only in mice housed at thermoneutrality (30°C) does corticosterone treatment reduce total BAT UCP1 protein. This reduction is reflected in reduced brown adipocyte cellular and mitochondrial UCP1-dependent respiration. However, glucocorticoid-induced obesity develops to the same extent in animals housed at 21°C and 30°C, whereas total BAT UCP1 protein levels differ 100-fold between the two groups. In corticosterone-treated wild-type and UCP1 knockout mice housed at 30°C, obesity also develops to the same extent. Thus, our results demonstrate that the development of glucocorticoid-induced obesity is not caused by a decreased UCP1-dependent thermogenic capacity.

A significant correlation was observed between vimentin expression and pathologic stage. Of the 4 patients who were evaluated a 2nd time after re-biopsy, 3 showed the same emt-related protein expression status as in the first analysis.

A 60-year-old female patient was admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology, Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (Changsha, China), complaining of abdominal distension, severe edema of both lower limbs and shortness of breath for more than 1 year. After intensive and careful medical investigations, the patient manifested with polyneuropathy, M-proteinemia, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, hypothyroidism, extravascular volume overload, sclerotic bone lesions, elevated VEGF and pulmonary hypertension. According to the latest diagnostic criteria of POEMS syndrome, this patient met two mandatory major criteria, two other major criteria and three minor criteria, the diagnosis was clear after ruling out differential diagnosis. The patient was treated with dexamethasone and lenalidomide, which relieved her clinical symptoms. The pathogenesis of POEMS syndrome is not fully understood; however, increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor may contribute to most of the clinical manifestations. This patient had been in physical discomfort for more than 14 months, which seriously affected her quality of life.

Anchorage-independent growth conditions reveal a differential SOS2 dependence for transformation and survival in RAS-mutant cancer cells.||||||||The RAS family of genes (HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS) is mutated in around 30% of human tumours. Wild-type RAS isoforms play an important role in mutant RAS-driven oncogenesis, indicating that RasGEFs may play a significant role in mutant RAS-driven transformation. We recently reported a hierarchical requirement for SOS2 in mutant RAS-driven transformation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, with KRAS>NRAS>HRAS (Sheffels et al., 2018). However, whether SOS2 deletion differentially affects mutant RAS isoform-dependent transformation in human tumour cell lines has not been tested. After validating sgRNAs that efficiently deleted HRAS and NRAS, we showed that the differential requirement for SOS2 to support anchorage-independent (3D) growth, which we previously demonstrated in MEFs, held true in cancer cells. KRAS-mutant cells showed a high dependence on SOS2 for 3D growth, as previously shown, whereas HRAS-mutant cells did not require SOS2 for 3D growth. This differential requirement was not due to differences in RTK-stimulated WT RAS activation, as SOS2 deletion reduced RTK-stimulated WT RAS/PI3K/AKT signalling in both HRAS and KRAS mutated cell lines. Instead, this differential requirement of SOS2 to promote transformation was due to the differential sensitivity of RAS-mutated cancer cells to reductions in WT RAS/PI3K/AKT signalling. KRAS mutated cancer cells required SOS2/PI3K signaling to protect them from anoikis, whereas survival of both HRAS and NRAS mutated cancer cells was not altered by SOS2 deletion. Finally, we present an integrated working model of SOS signaling in the context of mutant KRAS based on our findings and those of others.

Novel and established EWSR1 gene fusions and associations identified by next-generation sequencing and fluorescence in-situ hybridization.||||||||EWSR1 is a 'promiscuous' gene that can fuse with many different partner genes in phenotypically identical tumors or partner with the same genes in morphologically and behaviorally different neoplasms. Our study set out to examine the EWSR1 fusions identified at our institution over a 3-year period, using various methods, their association with specific entities and possible detection of novel partners and associations. Sixty-three consecutive cases investigated for EWSR1 gene fusions between 2015 and 2018 at our institution were included in this study. Fusions were identified by either break-apart fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), our clinical RNA-based assay for fusion transcript detection or both. Twenty-eight cases were concurrently tested by FISH and NGS, 24 were tested by FISH alone and 11 by NGS alone. Of the 28 cases with dual testing, 24 were positive by both assays for an EWSR1 gene fusion, 3 cases were discordant with a positive FISH assay and a negative NGS assay, and 1 case was discordant with a negative FISH assay but a positive NGS assay. Three novel fusions were identified: a complex rearrangement involving three genes (EWSR1/RBFOX2/ERG) in Ewing sarcoma, a EWSR1/TCF7L2 fusion in a colon adenocarcinoma, and a EWSR1/TFEB fusion in a translocation-associated renal cell carcinoma. Both colonic adenocarcinoma and renal cell carcinoma had not been previously associated with EWSR1 rearrangements to our knowledge. In a subset of cases, detection of a specific partner had an impact on the histological diagnosis and patient management. In our experience, the use of a targeted NGS-based fusion assay is superior to EWSR1 break-apart FISH for the detection of known and novel EWSR1 rearrangements and fusion partners, particularly given the emerging understanding that distinct fusion partners result in different diseases with distinct prognostic and therapeutic implications.

Effect of Diabetes Mellitus on Complication Rates of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting.||||||||Previous studies have shown that diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor for postoperative coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) complications. More contemporary studies are needed to guide revascularization decisions in DM patients. We performed a single-center study of patients who underwent CABG. Patients with no DM were compared with patients with DM, subgrouped according to whether or not DM was treated with insulin before admission (Insulin and No Insulin Groups). Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine whether DM was a significant predictor of mortality, combined postoperative events, and specific postoperative complications after controlling for other predictive clinical variables. Of 11,590 consecutive patients who underwent CABG, 5,013 (43%) had DM and 6,577 (57%) had no DM. Of the patients with DM, 3,433 (68%) were not treated with insulin and 1,580 (32%) were treated with insulin before admission. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that DM was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality or combined postoperative events after considering other clinical variables. The No Insulin Group was significantly associated with stroke, and the Insulin Group was significantly associated with surgical site infection and new renal failure. In conclusion, this study of consecutively treated CABG patients shows that DM is not a predictor of in-hospital mortality or combined in-hospital postoperative events after adjusting for other clinical factors. DM is a predictor of permanent stroke, surgical site infection, and new renal failure. These findings may help with case selection and management of DM patients undergoing CABG.

A Rationally Designed Humanized Antibody Selective for Amyloid Beta Oligomers in Alzheimer's Disease.||||||||Advances in the understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest that pathogenesis is not directly related to plaque burden, but rather to soluble toxic amyloid-beta oligomers (AßO). Therapeutic antibodies targeting Aß monomers and/or plaque have shown limited efficacy and dose-limiting adverse events in clinical trials. These findings suggest that antibodies capable of selectively neutralizing toxic AßO may achieve improved efficacy and safety. To this end, we generated monoclonal antibodies against a conformational Aß epitope predicted by computational modeling to be presented on toxic AßO but not monomers or fibrils. The resulting lead antibody, PMN310, showed the desired AßO-selective binding profile. In vitro, PMN310 inhibited AßO propagation and toxicity. In vivo, PMN310 prevented AßO-induced loss of memory formation and reduced synaptic loss and inflammation. A humanized version (huPMN310) compared favorably to other Aß-directed antibodies showing a lack of adverse event-associated binding to Aß deposits in AD brains, and greater selective binding to AßO-enriched AD brain fractions that contain synaptotoxic Aß species. Systemic administration of huPMN310 in mice resulted in brain exposure and kinetics comparable to those of other therapeutic human monoclonal antibodies. Greater selectivity for AßO and the potential to safely administer high doses of huPMN310 are expected to result in enhanced safety and therapeutic potency.

Mutations and Implications in Membrane Trafficking.|||||||| mutations, which are predicted to result in loss or disruption of the phosphatase domain, are associated with a severe phenotype and loss of independent ambulation by the early twenties. Whereas the few reported missense mutations and also those truncating mutations occurring at the C-terminus after the phosphatase domain cause a rather mild phenotype and patients were still ambulatory above the age 30 years. Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy and Centronuclear Myopathy causing mutations have been shown to occur in proteins involved in membrane remodeling and trafficking pathway mediated by phosphoinositides. Earlier studies have showing the rescue of MTM1 myopathy by MTMR2 overexpression, emphasize the importance of maintaining the phosphoinositides equilibrium and highlight a potential compensatory mechanism amongst members of this pathway. This proved that the regulation of expression of these proteins involved in the membrane remodeling pathway may compensate each other's loss- or gain-of-function mutations by restoring the phosphoinositides equilibrium. This provides a potential therapeutic strategy for neuromuscular diseases resulting from mutations in the membrane remodeling pathway.

Genotype/phenotype correlations of childhood-onset congenital sideroblastic anaemia in a European cohort.||||||||Congenital sideroblastic anaemia (CSA) is a rare disease caused by germline mutations of genes involved in haem and iron-sulphur cluster formation, and mitochondrial protein biosynthesis. We performed a retrospective multicentre European study of a cohort of childhood-onset CSA patients to explore genotype/phenotype correlations. We studied 23 females and 20 males with symptoms of CSA. Among the patients, the most frequently mutated genes were ALAS2 (n = 10; 23·3%) and SLC25A38 (n = 8; 18·6%), causing isolated forms of microcytic anaemia of varying severity. Five patients with SLC19A2 mutations suffered from thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia and three exhibited the 'anaemia, deafness and diabetes' triad. Three patients with TRNT1 mutations exhibited severe early onset microcytic anaemia associated with thrombocytosis, and two exhibited B-cell immunodeficiency, inflammatory syndrome and psychomotor delay. The prognoses of patients with TRNT1 and SLC2A38 mutations were generally dismal because of comorbidities or severe iron overload. No molecular diagnosis could be established in 14/43 cases. This study emphasizes the frequency of ALAS2 and SLC25A38 mutations and provides the largest comprehensive analysis to date of genotype/phenotype correlations in CSA. Further studies of CSA patients with data recorded in an international registry would be helpful to improve patient management and establish standardized guidelines.

Resorting the function of the colorectal cancer gatekeeper adenomatous polyposis coli.||||||||As a large number of cancers are caused by nonsense mutations in key genes, read-through of these mutations to restore full-length protein expression is a potential therapeutic strategy. Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene initiate the majority of both sporadic and hereditary colorectal cancers (CRC) and around 30% of these mutations are nonsense mutations. Our goal was to test the feasibility and effectiveness of APC nonsense mutation read-through as a potential chemo-preventive therapy in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), an inherited CRC syndrome patients. Ten FAP patients harboring APC nonsense mutations were treated with the read-through inducing antibiotic erythromycin for 4 months. Endoscopic assessment of the adenomas was performed at baseline, after 4 and after 12 months. Adenoma burden was documented in terms of adenoma number, maximal polyp size and cumulative polyp size per procedure. Tissue samples were collected and subjected to molecular and genetic analyses. Our results show that in the majority of patients the treatment led to a decrease in cumulative adenoma burden, median reduction in cumulative adenoma size and median reduction in adenoma number. Molecular and genetic analyses of the adenomas revealed that the treatment led to a reduced number of somatic APC mutations, reduced cellular proliferation and restoration of APC tumor-suppressing activity. Together, our findings show that induced read-through of APC nonsense mutations leads to promising clinical results and should be further investigated to establish its therapeutic potential in FAP and sporadic CRCs harboring nonsense APC mutations.

Severe elastolysis in hereditary gelsolin (AGel) amyloidosis.||||||||AGel amyloidosis is a dominantly inherited systemic amyloidosis caused by mutations p.D214N or p.D214Y resulting in gelsolin amyloid (AGel) formation. AGel accumulates extracellularly in many tissues and alongside elastic fibres. AGel deposition associates with elastic fibre degradation leading to severe clinical manifestations, such as cutis laxa and angiopathic complications. We analysed elastic fibre pathology in dermal and vascular tissue and plasma samples from 35 patients with AGel amyloidosis and 40 control subjects by transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and ELISA methods. To clarify the pathomechanism(s) of AGel-related elastolysis, we studied the roles of MMP-2, -7, -9, -12 and -14, TIMP-1 and TGFβ. We found massive accumulation of amyloid fibrils along elastic fibres as well as fragmentation and loss of elastic fibres in all dermal and vascular samples of AGel patients. Fibrils of distinct types formed fibrous matrix. The degradation pattern of elastic fibres in AGel patients was different from the age-related degradation in controls. The elastin of elastic fibres in AGel patients was strongly decreased compared to controls. MMP-9 was expressed at lower and TGFβ at higher levels in AGel patients than in controls. The accumulation of amyloid fibrils with severe elastolysis characterises both dermal and vascular derangement in AGel amyloidosis.

Mutant SOD1 proteins are susceptible to misfolding and abnormally accumulated in spinal cord, which is most severely affected in ALS. It, however, remains quite controversial whether misfolding of wild-type SOD1 is involved in more prevalent sporadic ALS (sALS) cases without SOD1 mutations.||||Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients including sALS as well as several other neurodegenerative diseases and non-neurodegenerative diseases was examined with an immunoprecipitation assay and a sandwich ELISA using antibodies specifically recognizing misfolded SOD1.||||We found that wild-type SOD1 was misfolded in CSF from all sALS cases examined in this study. The misfolded SOD1 was also detected in CSF from a subset of Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, albeit with smaller amounts than those in sALS. Furthermore, the CSF samples containing the misfolded SOD1 exhibited significant toxicity toward motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells, which was ameliorated by removal of the misfolded wild-type SOD1 with immunoprecipitation.||||Taken together, we propose that misfolding of wild-type SOD1 in CSF is a common pathological process of ALS cases regardless of SOD1 mutations.

A total of 37 individuals had deleterious mutations inABCG5orABCG8, but not in FH genes (8%,ABCG5/ABCG8mutation carriers). Among these, 3 individuals had sitosterolemia (0.6%) with double mutations. We also identified 18 individuals with deleterious mutations in an FH gene andABCG5orABCG8(4%,ABCG5/ABCG8-oligogenic FH). Subjects without mutations had significantly higher polygenic scores than those in any other groups.

Other rare mutations have been reported, however no additional hot-spot has been identified. We report an 8-month-old infant, with the heterozygous mutation, c.1043C > G, leading to an amino acid change from serine at 348 to cysteine (p.Ser348Cys). Clinical diagnosis of the patient is intertwined with "mild ACH" or "severe HCH". He did not demonstrate acanthosis nigricans (AN). This mutation has been reported in two different patients and it is located in the Ig-III domain of the FGFR3 region near other mutations associated with ACH. Among the two the 8-year old one also demonstrated AN without evindece of hyperinsulinem.

ADA2 deficiency (DADA2, OMIM 615688) is a monogenic autoinflammatory disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in ADA2, with clinical features including recurrent fever, livedo racemosa, hepatosplenomegaly, and strokes as well as immune dysregulation. This is the first report of NS/LAH and ADA2 deficiency in the same individual. We report on a patient presenting with facial features, recurrent infections and ectodermal findings in whom both the clinical and molecular diagnoses of NS/LAH and ADA2 deficiency were established, respectively.

Inflammatory neuropathology of infantile Alexander disease: A case report.||||||||Alexander disease (AxD) is a rare fatal leukodystrophy caused by a dominant missense mutation in the glial fibrillary acidic protein. In a mouse model of AxD, the pathological astrocyte causes a pronounced immune response. The inflammatory environment in the brain might play an important role in the neuronal dysfunction of AxD.||||A 3-month-old girl diagnosed with infantile AxD presented with severe intractable seizures and a deteriorated neurological state. Steroid pulse therapy was effective at preventing the epileptic activity and progressive white matter abnormalities on magnetic resonance images, but the effect was temporary. Levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and macrophage chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) in the cerebrospinal fluid were high at onset and reduced transiently after steroid pulse therapy.||||These results suggest that inflammatory responses of astrocyte and microglia can contribute to the neuropathology of AxD. Robust immunomodulation that targets activated astrocytes and microglia may be a novel therapeutic strategy to improve neurological prognosis in AxD.

A secondary form of amyloidosis was identified in AKU and related to high circulating serum amyloid A (SAA) levels, which are linked with inflammation and oxidative stress and might contribute to disease progression and patients' poor quality of life. Recently, we reported that inflammatory markers (SAA and chitotriosidase) and oxidative stress markers (protein thiolation index) might be disease activity markers in AKU. Thanks to an international network, we collected genotypic, phenotypic, and clinical data from more than 200 patients with AKU. These data are currently stored in our AKU database, named ApreciseKUre. In this work, we developed an algorithm able to make predictions about the oxidative status trend of each patient with AKU based on 55 predictors, namely circulating HGA, body mass index, total cholesterol, SAA, and chitotriosidase. Our general aim is to integrate the data of apparently heterogeneous patients with AKUAKU by using specific bioinformatics tools, in order to identify pivotal mechanisms involved in AKU for a preventive, predictive, and personalized medicine approach to AKU.-Cicaloni, V., Spiga, O., Dimitri, G.

Two Specific Sulfatide Species Are Dysregulated during Renal Development in a Mouse Model of Alport Syndrome.||||||||Alport syndrome is caused by mutations in collagen IV that alter the morphology of renal glomerular basement membrane. Mutations result in proteinuria, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and renal failure but the pathogenic mechanisms are not fully understood. Using imaging mass spectrometry, we aimed to determine whether the spatial and/or temporal patterns of renal lipids are perturbed during the development of Alport syndrome in the mouse model. Our results show that most sulfatides are present at similar levels in both the wild-type (WT) and the Alport kidneys, with the exception of two specific sulfatide species, SulfoHex-Cer(d18:2/24:0) and SulfoHex-Cer(d18:2/16:0). In the Alport but not in WT kidneys, the levels of these species mirror the previously described abnormal laminin expression in Alport syndrome. The presence of these sulfatides in renal tubules but not in glomeruli suggests that this specific aberrant lipid pattern may be related to the development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in Alport disease.

This study aimed to identify pathogenic mutations in a consanguineous Iranian family with AS. Next-generation sequencing was performed on the genomic DNA obtained from a 12 years old girl with AS. According to the bioinformatics analysis, computational modelling and segregation of variants, we identified two homozygous mutations close together in exon 8 of ALMS1 in the patient, including c.7262 G > T and c.7303-7305delAG. The clinically normal parents were heterozygous for both mutations. These mutations have a very rare frequency and only reported in the heterozygous state in the public genomic databases. Overall, due to the large size of the ALMS1 gene and clinical similarity with other ciliopathies and genetic disorders, whole exome sequencing can be useful for the identification of pathogenic mutations and the improvement of AS clinical management.

HAP1 is an in vivo UBE3A target that augments autophagy in a mouse model of Angelman syndrome.||||||||Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by maternal mutation and paternal imprinting of the gene encoding UBE3A, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Although several potential target proteins of UBE3A have been reported, how these proteins regulate neuronal development remains unclear. We performed a large-scale quantitative proteomic analysis using stable-isotope labeling of amino acids in mammals (SILAM) in mice with maternal Ube3a mutation. We identified huntingtin (Htt)-associated protein (HAP1), a protein that is involved in Huntington's disease (HD), as a new target of UBE3A. We demonstrate that HAP1 regulates autophagy at the initiation stage by promoting PtdIns3K complex formation and enhancing its activity. HAP1 also co-localized with MAP1LC3 (LC3) and other proteins involved in autophagosome expansion. As a result, HAP1 increased autophagy flux. Strikingly, knocking down of HAP1 alleviated aberrant autophagy in primary neurons from AS mice. Concordantly, treatment of AS neurons with an autophagy inhibitor alleviated the reduction in density of dendritic spines. Furthermore, autophagy inhibition in AS mice partially alleviated a social interaction deficit as shown in open field test. Thus, our results identify HAP1 as an in vivo UBE3A target that contributes to deregulated autophagy and synaptic dysfunction in the central nervous system of AS mouse.

Modeling the Biochemical Phenotype of MCT8 Mutations In Vitro: Resolving a Troubling Inconsistency.||||||||Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is a severe genetic disease caused by mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) gene. MCT8 mediates transport of thyroid hormones in and out of cells, which is thought to play a pivotal role for embryonic and postnatal development of the human brain. Disconcertingly, MCT8R271H leads to a severe form of AHDS but shows residual transport activity when expressed in several types of cultured cells. Here we try to determine the mechanism behind the transport function of MCT8R271H found in overexpressing cell systems. Mutations of Arg271 were introduced into human MCT8 and stably transfected into Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and the human-derived cell line JEG1. Radioactive thyroid hormone-uptake experiments were performed to analyze the pH-dependent effect of the mutation on transport activity. Arg271His transports thyroid hormones in and out of cells in a pH-dependent manner. Its transport activity increases below pH 7.3 and is clearly diminished at physiological pH. The Michaelis constant of the mutant is unaltered, whereas the maximum velocity is reduced. The expression of Arg271His in JEG1 cells leads to an almost nonfunctional transporter at physiological pH replicating the human phenotype for this mutant in vitro and demonstrates, again, that mutant MCT8 activity depends on cellular background. The protonation of His271 at acidic pH restores activity of the mutant protein, which is not active in its deprotonated form at physiological pH. Thus, experimental parameters must be controlled carefully when modeling MCT8 deficiency in cells.

Laboratory testing in suspected A1AT deficiency involves quantifying serum A1AT concentration and identification of specific alleles by genotyping and phenotyping. The aim of this report was to present a case of the null allele carrier with consequent genotype/phenotype/concentration discrepancies and potential misclassification of the Z variant in a 42-year-old white man presenting with symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).||||Serum A1AT concentration was measured using an immunoturbidimetric assay. A1AT phenotype was determined using isoelectric focusing followed with immunofixation (IEF-IF). Genotyping specifically for the S and Z allele was performed by melting curve analysis using real-time PCR and checked by an alternative PCR-RFLP method. Genotype/phenotype ambiguity and discrepancy were amended using gene sequencing.||||Laboratory testing revealed highly reduced A1AT concentration (less than 0.30 g/L), mild to moderate deficient genotype (Pi*Z allele: M/Z and Pi*S allele: M/M) and severe deficient Z homozygous phenotype (Pi ZZ). After repeated sampling, the same discordant results were verified by these tests. Further sequencing revealed two clinically relevant and defective variants: rs199422210 (a rare null allele) and rs28929474 (the Z allele).||||Due to inability of genotyping kit probes to detect null/Z allele combination (which mimics the Pi ZZ phenotype), our patient was misclassified as mild to moderate deficient Pi*MZ heterozygote. In all unclear cases, whole-gene sequencing is highly recommended in order to determine definitive cause of A1AT deficiency.

Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Gene Mutations in 22 Chinese Pedigrees with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis.||||||||BACKGROUND Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which has a very high tendency of progression to colorectal cancer, is mainly caused by mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. This study systematically screened the APC mutations and observed the correlation of APC mutations with clinical manifestations of FAP. MATERIAL AND METHODS Eighty subjects (probands and their family members of 22 FAP pedigrees) were enrolled, underwent abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography, and colonoscopic examinations, and were assessed for APC mutations between January 2010 and June 2015 at Tianjin Union Medical Center. Peripheral blood was collected from subjects, and DNA was extracted and screened for APC mutations using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for large-fragment deletions or PCR-denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography with DNA sequencing for micromutations. RESULTS Nineteen of 22 FAP pedigrees were found to have mutations of APC, and 17 types APC mutations were identified. All the mutations were heterozygosity with autosomal dominant inheritance. APC mutations included 8 caused by frameshift, 3 by aberrant splicing, 2 by missense mutation, 2 by nonsense mutation, and 2 by large-fragment deletion. Frameshift mutation was the most common type of APC mutation, and Coding DNA Sequence 15 was the most common mutation site. Five novel APC mutations, including 1 with large-fragment deletion, were identified. CONCLUSIONS We systematically screened 17 mutations of APC from 22 Chinese pedigrees with FAP. This study will broaden the spectrum of known APC germline mutations and help understand the types and distribution of APC mutations among Chinese patients with FAP.

Complications of Insufficient Dura and Blood Loss During Surgical Intervention in Shprintzen-Goldberg Syndrome: A Case Report.||||||||BACKGROUND Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is an extremely rare collagenopathy, most often caused by autosomal-dominant mutations in the SKI proto-oncogene, which is a component of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-ß) signaling pathway. Approximately 50-60 cases of SGS have been recorded in the literature worldwide since its discovery in 1982. This collagen disorder affects bone and vascular development throughout the body, resulting in craniosynostosis, scoliosis, chest deformities, and aortic root dilation. Patients may have problems in the central nervous system, including Chiari 1 malformation, hydrocephalus, and dilation of the lateral ventricles. Unfortunately, the symptoms of SGS closely parallel those of related collagenopathies involving mutations in the TGF-ß signaling pathway, which makes accurate diagnosis difficult without genetic testing, especially in cases with complex presentation. CASE REPORT In this report we present the unique and complex disease manifestations in a 9-year-old girl with SGS. The patient had severe cervical spinal instability that resolved after surgical occipital-C4 fusion with an autograft from the rib. Midface distraction surgery was used to treat the patient's craniosynostosis and related facial deformities. This surgery was complicated by loss of 750 mL of blood due to insufficient dura and prominent vasculature. CONCLUSIONS Connective tissue symptoms associated with SGS can involve dural and vascular problems, as seen in this case report. Thus, the risk of extreme blood loss should be anticipated any time midface distraction surgery is performed on an SGS patient. Continued research is needed to define how this case relates to the SGS patient population.

Motor activity and Becker's muscular dystrophy: lights and shadows.||||||||Becker's disease is an inherited muscular dystrophy caused by mutations in the gene coding for the dystrophin protein that leads to quantitative and/or qualitative protein dysfunction and consequent muscle degeneration. Studies in animal models demonstrate that, while eccentric or high-intensity training are deleterious for dystrophic muscles, low-intensity aerobic training may slowdown the disease process and progression. Based on these preclinical data, the available studies in patients with Becker's muscular dystrophy undergoing workout on a cycle ergometer or on a treadmill, at a heart rate ≤65% of their maximal oxygen uptake, showed that aerobic exercise counteracts physical deterioration and loss of functional abilities. These findings suggest an improvement of physical performance through an increase of muscle strength, fatigue resistance, and dexterity capacities, without substantial evidence of acceleration of muscular damage progression. Therefore, individually tailored mild-to-moderate intensity aerobic exercise should be considered as part of the management of these patients. However, further research is necessary to define specific and standardized guidelines for the prescription of type, intensity, frequency, and duration of motor activities. In this review, we provided a summary of the impact of physical activity both in animal models and in patients with Becker's muscular dystrophy, with the intent to identify trends and gaps in knowledge. The potential therapeutic implications and future research directions have been also highlighted.

SIRT1 activation alleviates brain microvascular endothelial dysfunction in peroxisomal disorders.||||||||Peroxisomal disorders are genetically heterogeneous metabolic disorders associated with a deficit of very long chain fatty acid β‑oxidation that commonly manifest as early‑onset neurodegeneration. Brain microvascular endothelial dysfunction with increased permeability to monocytes has been described in X‑linked adrenoleukodystrophy, one of the most common peroxisomal disorders caused by mutations of the ATP binding cassette subfamily D member 1 (ABCD1) gene. The present study demonstrated that dysregulation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) mediates changes in adhesion molecules and tight‑junction protein expression, as well as increased adhesion to monocytes associated with peroxisomal dysfunction due to ABCD1 or hydroxysteroid 17‑β dehydrogenase 4 silencing. Furthermore, enhancement of the function of SIRT1 by resveratrol attenuated this molecular and functional dysregulation of HBMECs via modulation of the nuclear factor‑κB and Krüppel‑like factor 4 signaling pathways.

Glibenclamide reverses cardiovascular abnormalities of Cantu Syndrome driven by KATP channel overactivity.||||||||Cantu Syndrome (CS) is a complex disorder caused by gain-of-function (GoF) mutations in ABCC9 and KCNJ8, which encode the SUR2 and Kir6.1 subunits, respectively, of vascular smooth muscle (VSM) KATP channels. CS includes dilated vasculature, marked cardiac hypertrophy, and other cardiovascular abnormalities. There is currently no targeted therapy, and it is unknown whether cardiovascular features can be reversed once manifest. Using combined transgenic and pharmacological approaches in a knock-in mouse model of CS, we have shown that reversal of vascular and cardiac phenotypes can be achieved (1) by genetic downregulation of KATP channel activity specifically in VSM, and (2) by chronic administration of the clinically-used KATP channel inhibitor, glibenclamide. These findings demonstrate (i) that VSM KATP channel GoF underlies CS cardiac enlargement, (ii) reversibility of CS-associated abnormalities and (iii) evidence of in vivo efficacy of glibenclamide as a therapeutic agent in CS.

Prevalence of Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis Among Patients Diagnosed With Acquired Juvenile-Onset Idiopathic Bilateral Cataracts.||||||||Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive bile acid synthesis disorder caused by mutations in CYP27A1, the gene encoding sterol 27-hydroxylase, which results in elevated levels of plasma cholestanol and urinary bile alcohols. Clinical symptoms and signs may include early-onset chronic diarrhea, juvenile-onset bilateral cataracts, cholestatic jaundice, tendon xanthomas, and progressive neurological deterioration. Although initiation of treatment at a young age can prevent disease complications, diagnosis often occurs after the onset of permanent neurologic damage. Strategies are needed to facilitate early diagnosis.||||To evaluate the prevalence of CTX in a patient population diagnosed with early-onset idiopathic bilateral cataracts.||||This interim analysis of the Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis Prevalence Study was conducted in 26 active US sites from November 2015 to June 2017. The study included patients diagnosed as having idiopathic bilateral cataracts from ages 2 to 21 years. Potentially eligible study participants were identified through retrospective medical record review or on receiving care for cataracts at an active site. Data were analyzed from July 2017 to October 2018.||||Measurement of plasma cholestanol levels and optional urine bile alcohol screening were performed. A plasma cholestanol concentration of 0.4 mg/dL or greater or a positive urine bile alcohol result prompted CYP27A1 genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis of CTX.||||Of 170 tested patients, 88 (51.8%) were male, and the median (range) age was 10 (2-49) years. A total of 3 patients (1.8%) had biochemical and genetic confirmation of newly diagnosed CTX (plasma cholestanol level greater than 1.0 mg/dL, positive urine bile alcohol result, and disease-causative mutations in CYP27A1). The mean (range) age at cataract diagnosis for patients with CTX was 12 (8-16) years. Reported symptoms included abnormal gait or balance (n = 3), learning disability (n = 2), cognitive decline (n = 2), seizures (n = 2), frequent bone fractures (n = 2), and chronic diarrhea (n = 1).||||To date, 1.8% of patients in this study were diagnosed as having CTX, which is approximately 500-fold the currently estimated prevalence of CTX in the general population (3 to 5 per 100 000). These data suggest that juvenile-onset idiopathic bilateral cataracts may be useful as a screening marker for CTX and that ophthalmologists can play an important role in facilitating early identification of this condition.

The Charcot-Marie Tooth Disease Mutation R94Q in MFN2 Decreases ATP Production but Increases Mitochondrial Respiration under Conditions of Mild Oxidative Stress.||||||||Charcot-Marie tooth disease is a hereditary polyneuropathy caused by mutations in Mitofusin-2 (MFN2), a GTPase in the outer mitochondrial membrane involved in the regulation of mitochondrial fusion and bioenergetics. Autosomal-dominant inheritance of a R94Q mutation in MFN2 causes the axonal subtype 2A2A which is characterized by early onset and progressive atrophy of distal muscles caused by motoneuronal degeneration. Here, we studied mitochondrial shape, respiration, cytosolic, and mitochondrial ATP content as well as mitochondrial quality control in MFN2-deficient fibroblasts stably expressing wildtype or R94Q MFN2. Under normal culture conditions, R94Q cells had slightly more fragmented mitochondria but a similar mitochondrial oxygen consumption, membrane potential, and ATP production as wildtype cells. However, when inducing mild oxidative stress 24 h before analysis using 100 µM hydrogen peroxide, R94Q cells exhibited significantly increased respiration but decreased mitochondrial ATP production. This was accompanied by increased glucose uptake and an up-regulation of hexokinase 1 and pyruvate kinase M2, suggesting increased pyruvate shuttling into mitochondria. Interestingly, these changes coincided with decreased levels of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in R94Q cells. We conclude that mitochondria harboring the disease-causing R94Q mutation in MFN2 are more susceptible to oxidative stress, which causes uncoupling of respiration and ATP production possibly by a less efficient mitochondrial quality control.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Type 2E/1F mutant neurofilament proteins assemble into neurofilaments.||||||||Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Type 2E/1F (CMT2E/1F) is a peripheral neuropathy caused by mutations in neurofilament protein L (NFL), which is one of five neurofilament subunit proteins that co-assemble to form neurofilaments in vivo. Prior studies on cultured cells have shown that CMT2E/1F mutations disrupt neurofilament assembly and lead to protein aggregation, suggesting a possible disease mechanism. However, electron microscopy of axons in peripheral nerve biopsies from patients has revealed accumulations of neurofilament polymers of normal appearance and no evidence of protein aggregates. To reconcile these observations, we reexamined the assembly of seven CMT2E/1F NFL mutants in cultured cells. None of the mutants assembled into homopolymers in SW13vim- cells, but P8R, P22S, L268/269P, and P440/441L mutant NFL assembled into heteropolymers in the presence of neurofilament protein M (NFM) alone, and N98S, Q332/333P, and E396/397K mutant NFL assembled in the presence of NFM and peripherin. P8R, P22S, N98S, L268/269P, E396/397K, and P440/441L mutant NFL co-assembled into neurofilaments with endogenous NFL, NFM, and α-internexin in cultured neurons, although the N98S and E396/397K mutants showed reduced filament incorporation, and the Q332/333P mutant showed limited incorporation. We conclude that all the mutants are capable of assembling into neurofilaments, but for some of the mutants this was dependent on the identity of the other neurofilament proteins available for co-assembly, and most likely also their relative expression level. Thus, caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions about the assembly capacity of CMT2E/1F mutants based on transient transfections in cultured cells.

All 5 children were confirmed with HS by peripheral blood genetic detection. Anemia, jaundice and splenomegaly were observed in all 5 children. Three children had an increase in erythrocyte osmotic fragility. All 5 children had negative results of the Coombs test, glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase test, sucrose hemolysis test, acidified-serum hemolysis test and thalassemia gene test. Peripheral blood smear showed an increase in spherocyte count in one child. High-throughput sequencing revealed ANK1 gene mutations in patients 1 to 3, namely c.3398(exon29)delA, c.4306C>T and c.957(exon9)_c.961(exon9)delAATCT, among which c.3398(exon29)delA had not been reported before. Patient 4 had c.318delGExon3 mutation in the SPTB gene. Patient 5 had mutations in the SPTB and SLC4A1 genes, among which c.3484delC in the SPTB gene was a spontaneous mutation; the mutation site of the SLCA4A1 gene was inherited from the father and was a non-pathogenic gene. This study suggests that anemia, jaundice and splenomegaly are major clinical manifestations of HS children. Most children with HS do not have the typical spherocytic changes. Genetic detection may help with the accurate diagnosis of HS.

A family with nemaline myopathy type 6 caused by hseterozygous mutation (c.1222C>T) in the KBTBD13 gene in China: A case report.||||||||Nemaline myopathy (NEM) is a congenital myopathy that typically presents with proximal muscle weakness and hypotonia. To date, 13 genes have been associated with NEM. The Kelch repeat and BTB domain-containing protein 13 (KBTBD13) gene (KBTBD13)-related NEM is a rarely reported condition, and not a single case has been reported in Asia. Here, we report the case of a mother and daughter in China with NEM caused by a mutation (c.1222C>T) in KBTBD13. Their shared clinical phenotype is symmetrical muscle weakness in the arms and legs with childhood onset. Muscle magnetic resonance imaging showed the unique replacement mode of muscle with fibro-fatty tissue. Histopathological examination revealed the presence of fibers containing rod-shaped structures in the cytoplasm or under the sarcolemma. DNA sequencing analysis detected a heterozygous mutation (c.1222C>T) in KBTBD13 in this family. A founder effect for the variant may exist in the Low Countries of Belgium and the Netherlands, and the mutation may be a hotspot mutation in Europe, as it has not been reported in Asia. Our case study expands the spectrum of KBTBD13-related NEM.

Discovery of autism/intellectual disability somatic mutations in Alzheimer's brains: mutated ADNP cytoskeletal impairments and repair as a case study.||||||||With Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibiting reduced ability of neural stem cell renewal, we hypothesized that de novo mutations controlling embryonic development, in the form of brain somatic mutations instigate the disease. A leading gene presenting heterozygous dominant de novo autism-intellectual disabilities (ID) causing mutations is activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), with intact ADNP protecting against AD-tauopathy. We discovered a genomic autism ADNP mutation (c.2188C>T) in postmortem AD olfactory bulbs and hippocampi. RNA-Seq of olfactory bulbs also identified a novel ADNP hotspot mutation, c.2187_2188insA. Altogether, 665 mutations in 596 genes with 441 mutations in AD patients (389 genes, 38% AD-exclusive mutations) and 104 genes presenting disease-causing mutations (OMIM) were discovered. OMIM AD mutated genes converged on cytoskeletal mechanisms, autism and ID causing mutations (about 40% each). The number and average frequencies of AD-related mutations per subject were higher in AD subjects compared to controls. RNA-seq datamining (hippocampus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, fusiform gyrus and superior frontal gyrus-583 subjects) yielded similar results. Overlapping all tested brain areas identified unique and shared mutations, with ADNP singled out as a gene associated with autism/ID/AD and presenting several unique aging/AD mutations. The large fusiform gyrus library (117 subjects) with high sequencing coverage correlated the c.2187_2188insA ADNP mutation frequency to Braak stage (tauopathy) and showed more ADNP mutations in AD specimens. In cell cultures, the ADNP-derived snippet NAP inhibited mutated-ADNP-microtubule (MT) toxicity and enhanced Tau-MT association. We propose a paradigm-shifting concept in the perception of AD whereby accumulating mosaic somatic mutations promote brain pathology.

Fibroadipogenic progenitors are responsible for muscle loss in limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B.||||||||Muscle loss due to fibrotic or adipogenic replacement of myofibers is common in muscle diseases and muscle-resident fibro/adipogenic precursors (FAPs) are implicated in this process. While FAP-mediated muscle fibrosis is widely studied in muscle diseases, the role of FAPs in adipogenic muscle loss is not well understood. Adipogenic muscle loss is a feature of limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B) - a disease caused by mutations in dysferlin. Here we show that FAPs cause the adipogenic loss of dysferlin deficient muscle. Progressive accumulation of Annexin A2 (AnxA2) in the myofiber matrix causes FAP differentiation into adipocytes. Lack of AnxA2 prevents FAP adipogenesis, protecting against adipogenic loss of dysferlinopathic muscle while exogenous AnxA2 enhances muscle loss. Pharmacological inhibition of FAP adipogenesis arrests adipogenic replacement and degeneration of dysferlin-deficient muscle. These results demonstrate the pathogenic role of FAPs in LGMD2B and establish these cells as therapeutic targets to ameliorate muscle loss in patients.

The ion channel function of polycystin-1 in the polycystin-1/polycystin-2 complex.||||||||Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is caused by mutations in PKD1 or PKD2 gene, encoding the polycystic kidney disease protein polycystin-1 and the transient receptor potential channel polycystin-2 (also known as TRPP2), respectively. Polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 form a receptor-ion channel complex located in primary cilia. The function of this complex, especially the role of polycystin-1, is largely unknown due to the lack of a reliable functional assay. In this study, we dissect the role of polycystin-1 by directly recording currents mediated by a gain-of-function (GOF) polycystin-1/polycystin-2 channel. Our data show that this channel has distinct properties from that of the homomeric polycystin-2 channel. The polycystin-1 subunit directly contributes to the channel pore, and its eleven transmembrane domains are sufficient for its channel function. We also show that the cleavage of polycystin-1 at the N-terminal G protein-coupled receptor proteolysis site is not required for the activity of the GOF polycystin-1/polycystin-2 channel. These results demonstrate the ion channel function of polycystin-1 in the polycystin-1/polycystin-2 complex, enriching our understanding of this channel and its role in ADPKD.

Classically, the disease manifests as scapulo-humero-peroneal muscle wasting and weakness, early joint contractures and dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction blocks; however, variable skeletal muscle involvement can be present. Previously, we and other demonstrated altered activity of signaling pathways in hearts and striated muscles of LmnaH222P/H222P mice, a model of autosomal EDMD. We showed that blocking their activation improved cardiac function. However, the evaluation of the benefit of these treatments on the whole organism is suffering from a better knowledge of the performance in mouse models. We show in the present study that LmnaH222P/H222P mice display a significant loss of lean mass, consistent with the dystrophic process. This is associated with altered VO2 peak and respiratory exchange ratio. These results showed for the first time that LmnaH222P/H222P mice have decreased performance and provided a new useful means for future therapeutic interventions on this model of EDMD.

Birt-Hogg-Dubé Syndrome-associated Renal Cell Carcinoma: Histopathological Features and Diagnostic Conundrum.||||||||Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome is associated with the development of hereditary renal cell carcinoma and is caused by a germline mutation in the folliculin gene. Most cases of BHD syndrome-associated RCC (BHD-RCC) are less aggressive and multifocal. Therefore, it is critical to distinguish BHD-RCC from its sporadic counterparts to identify and monitor affected families and to preserve renal function as long as possible. The World Health Organization/International Society of Urological Pathology consensus classification defined distinct entities for certain hereditary RCCs; however, BHD-RCC was not included in this classification. Although the clinical features and molecular mechanisms of BHD-RCC have been investigated intensively over the last two decades, pathologists and urologists occasionally face difficulties in the diagnosis of BHD-RCCs that require genetic testing. Affected patients usually have miscellaneous benign disorders that often precede renal carcinogenesis. In the present review, we summarize the current understanding of the histopathological features of BHD-RCC based on our epidemiologic studies of Japanese families and a literature review. The pathological diagnostic clues and differential diagnosis of BHD-RCC from other hereditary RCCs are also briefly discussed.

It is clinically characterized by coloboma of the eyes, heart defects, choanal atresia, retardation of growth and/or development, genital and/or urinary anomalies and ear malformations associated with deafness and vestibular disorder(s). This case series reported nine molecularly confirmed Chinese CS patients from nine unrelated families in Hong Kong. Clinical phenotype and facial features of these nine Chinese CS patients together with four previously reported Chinese patients were reviewed. Typical presentations like coloboma and choanal atresia were not universally present. The prevalence of choanal atresia in these Chinese CS patients was found to be significantly lower than that in previous cohorts of other ethnic groups. This report highlighted the existence of phenotypic variation of CS among different ethnicities and suggested that a high index of suspicion is necessary for diagnosis of CS in Chinese patients.

A physiologically-motivated model of cystic fibrosis liquid and solute transport dynamics across primary human nasal epithelia.||||||||Cystic fibrosis (CF) disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene coding for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an anion channel expressed in the mucosal side of epithelial tissue. In the airway, dysfunctional CFTR results in a transepithelial osmotic imbalance leading to hyperabsorption of airway surface liquid mucostasis, chronic inflammation, and eventual respiratory failure. Human nasal epithelial cell cultures from healthy and CF donors were used to perform studies of liquid and solute transport dynamics at an air/liquid interface in order to emulate the in vivo airway. Then, these results were used to inform a quantitative systems pharmacology model of airway epithelium describing electrically and chemically driven transcellular ionic transport, contributions of both convective and diffusive paracellular solute transport, and osmotically driven transepithelial water dynamics. Model predictions showed CF cultures, relative to non-CF ones, have increased apical and basolateral water permeabilities, and increase paracellular permeability and transepithelial chemical driving force for a radiolabeled tracer used to track small molecule absorption. These results provide a computational platform to better understand and probe the mechanisms behind the liquid hyperabsorption and small molecule retention profiles observed in the CF airway.

Anti-inflammatories and mucociliary clearance therapies in the age of CFTR modulators.||||||||Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic and life-limiting disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. This multi-system disease is characterized by progressive lung disease and pancreatic insufficiency amongst other manifestations. CFTR primarily functions as a chloride channel that transports ions across the apical membrane of epithelial cells but has other functions, including bicarbonate secretion and inhibition of sodium transport. Defective CFTR disrupts these functions, causing viscous and dehydrated mucus to accumulate, compromising the airway lumen and contributing to obstructive pulmonary disease. The combination of CFTR dysfunction, mucus obstruction, and infection drive an exaggerated and dysfunctional inflammatory response, which contributes to irreversible airway destruction and fibrosis. CFTR modulators, an exciting new class of drugs, increase the expression and/or function of CFTR variant protein and improve multiple clinical endpoints, such as lung function, pulmonary exacerbation rates, and nutritional status. However, these genotype-specific drugs are not universally available, the clinical response is variable, and lung function still declines over time when bronchiectasis is established. Consequently, even in the age of CFTR modulators, we must target other important aspects of the CF airway disease, such as inflammation and mucociliary clearance. This review highlights the mechanisms of inflammation and mucus accumulation in the CF lung and discusses anti-inflammatory and mucociliary clearance agents that are currently in development focusing on compounds for which clinical trial data have recently become available.

Intranasal micro-optical coherence tomography imaging for cystic fibrosis studies.||||||||Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Although impairment of mucociliary clearance contributes to severe morbidity and mortality in people with CF, a clear understanding of the pathophysiology is lacking. This is, in part, due to the absence of clinical imaging techniques capable of capturing CFTR-dependent functional metrics at the cellular level. Here, we report the clinical translation of a 1-μm resolution micro-optical coherence tomography (μOCT) technology to quantitatively characterize the functional microanatomy of human upper airways. Using a minimally invasive intranasal imaging approach, we performed a clinical study on age- and sex-matched CF and control groups. We observed delayed mucociliary transport rate at the cellular level, depletion of periciliary liquid layer, and prevalent loss of ciliation in subjects with CF. Distinctive morphological differences in mucus and various forms of epithelial injury were also revealed by μOCT imaging and had prominent effects on the mucociliary transport apparatus. Elevated mucus reflectance intensity in CF, a proxy for viscosity in situ, had a dominant effect. These results demonstrate the utility of μOCT to determine epithelial function and monitor disease status of CF airways on a per-patient basis, with applicability for other diseases of mucus clearance.

Pharmacological analysis of CFTR variants of cystic fibrosis using stem cell-derived organoids.||||||||Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening genetic disease caused by mutations of CFTR, the gene encoding cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. Despite considerable progress in CF therapies, targeting specific CFTR genotypes based on small molecules has been hindered because of the substantial genetic heterogeneity of CFTR mutations in patients with CF, which is difficult to assess by animal models in vivo. There are broadly four classes (e.g., II, III, and IV) of CF genotypes that differentially respond to current CF drugs (e.g., VX-770 and VX-809). In this review, we shed light on the pharmacogenomics of diverse CFTR mutations and the emerging role of stem cell-based organoids in predicting the CF drug response. We discuss mechanisms that underlie differential CF drug responses both in organoid-based assays and in CF clinical trials, thereby facilitating the precision design of safer and more effective therapies for individual patients with CF.

On examination, foot deformity was observed without weakness or sensory involvement, and in the muscles of the lower extremities magnetic resonance imaging showed no fat replacement. Further analysis of FGD4 expression in peripheral blood suggested that neither mutation affected splicing, nor did they affect the dosage of FGD4 mRNA (compared to a healthy control). It was predicted that each allele would produce a truncated protein, p.Ala172Glnfs*28 (c.514delG) and p.Ala738Serfs*5 (c.2211dupA), the latter containing all the functional domains of the native protein.||||The conservation of functional domains in the proteins produced from the FGD4 gene of two patients with CMT4H, could explain both the milder phenotype and the later disease onset in these patients.

Her genotype was identical to her affected brother confirming that in these siblings, the RYR1 mutations, transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern, are the cause of their myopathy. The adult age at diagnosis of these affected siblings likely reflects the mild and minimally progressive nature of the myopathy.

A case of Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome implying reduced or no wild-type folliculin without mutated protein is pathogenic.||||||||Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHDS) is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome caused by a germline mutation of the folliculin (FLCN) gene. Previous studies have suggested that truncated mutant folliculin proteins generated by disease causing FLCN mutations may retain partial functionality and contribute to disease phenotype. A 38-year-old Russian man presented with a left renal tumor. He underwent a left radical nephrectomy and histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. He had papulae on his face suggestive of fibrofolliculomas, and pulmonary cysts on his computed tomography of the chest. He had a family history of skin manifestations. Genetic analysis identified a genomic deletion including the putative promoter region of FLCN exon 1 in the germline, and the second hit on the remaining wild-type FLCN in the renal carcinoma cells, which is expected to cause the complete lack of folliculin protein. Immunohistochemistry with the use of anti-folliculin antibody showed no antibody-binding on chromophobe renal carcinoma cells. These findings suggest that the decreased FLCN expression itself without producing mutated folliculin proteins can be at risk for developing clinical manifestations of BHDS: fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts, and tumorigenesis in the kidneys. This sheds light on the pathogenesis of BHDS and the role of FLCN as a tumor suppressor gene.

Calmodulin mutations and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias: insights from the International Calmodulinopathy Registry.||||||||Calmodulinopathies are rare life-threatening arrhythmia syndromes which affect mostly young individuals and are, caused by mutations in any of the three genes (CALM 1-3) that encode identical calmodulin proteins. We established the International Calmodulinopathy Registry (ICalmR) to understand the natural history, clinical features, and response to therapy of patients with a CALM-mediated arrhythmia syndrome.||||A dedicated Case Report File was created to collect demographic, clinical, and genetic information. ICalmR has enrolled 74 subjects, with a variant in the CALM1 (n = 36), CALM2 (n = 23), or CALM3 (n = 15) genes. Sixty-four (86.5%) were symptomatic and the 10-year cumulative mortality was 27%. The two prevalent phenotypes are long QT syndrome (LQTS; CALM-LQTS, n = 36, 49%) and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT; CALM-CPVT, n = 21, 28%). CALM-LQTS patients have extremely prolonged QTc intervals (594 ± 73 ms), high prevalence (78%) of life-threatening arrhythmias with median age at onset of 1.5 years [interquartile range (IQR) 0.1-5.5 years] and poor response to therapies. Most electrocardiograms (ECGs) show late onset peaked T waves. All CALM-CPVT patients were symptomatic with median age of onset of 6.0 years (IQR 3.0-8.5 years). Basal ECG frequently shows prominent U waves. Other CALM-related phenotypes are idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF, n = 7), sudden unexplained death (SUD, n = 4), overlapping features of CPVT/LQTS (n = 3), and predominant neurological phenotype (n = 1). Cardiac structural abnormalities and neurological features were present in 18 and 13 patients, respectively.||||Calmodulinopathies are largely characterized by adrenergically-induced life-threatening arrhythmias. Available therapies are disquietingly insufficient, especially in CALM-LQTS. Combination therapy with drugs, sympathectomy, and devices should be considered.

To our knowledge, no larger deletions have been reported.||||A 17-year-old adolescent male was evaluated due to delayed puberty and short stature. He had a height of 154.4 cm (SDS -2.84), a weight of 53.3 kg (SDS -1.41), a BMI of 22.4 kg/m2 (SDS +0.31), a Tanner 2 pubertal stage with a testicular volume of 10 mL, and a bone age of 16 years (SDS -1.33). After biochemical evaluation, low IGF-I levels, undetectable IGFBP-3 levels, and a normal response to the GH stimulation test were observed, suggesting GH insensitivity. ACLSD was confirmed by ALS measurement (116 ng/mL, SDS -3.19) and genetic analysis of IGFALS. An apparently homozygous missense variant, p. Pro624Leu, was found in exon 2 of the proband; this mutation was observed on one allele of the proband's father but was absent in the mother and siblings. Deletion/duplication analysis by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was consistent with a deletion encompassing a significant part of exon 2 on one allele in the proband and in his mother and siblings.||||This is the first report of a large deletion in a patient with ACLSD. Deletion/duplication analysis should be considered in the genetic study of ACLSD, especially when homozygosity for a pathogenic variant cannot be confirmed by the study of the parents or when no variants are found but ALS concentrations are very low.

A total of 21 subjects with AS from 20 unrelated Chinese families were recruited. Our cohort consists of 9 females and 12 males, between 5 months and 20 years old. The first symptom(s) appeared between 3 and 24 months. They were recorded to be either visual impairments (83%) or dilated cardiomyopathy (17%). Median time from symptom onset to seeking medical attention was 6 months (3-36 months) and the median time needed to reach the final molecular diagnosis is 54 months (6-240 months). System involvement at the time of the survey was as follows: visual symptoms (100%), hearing Impairment (67%), endocrine symptoms (43%), neurological symptoms (19%), hepatic symptoms (14%), and renal Involvement (14%). These findings are comparable to data reported in the literature. However, the proportion of subjects with cognitive impairment (33%) and behavioral problems (19%) were higher. Thirty-three unique mutations were identified in the ALMS1 gene, of which 18 are novel mutations classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic according to the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guideline. Four recurrent mutations were identified in the cohort, in particular; c.2084C>A, p. (Ser695Ter), is suggestive to be a founder mutation in people of Chinese ancestry. The participation of AS subjects of differing ethnicities is essential to improve the algorithm in facial recognition/phenotyping, as well as to understand the mutation spectrum beyond than just those of European ancestry.

Genomic knockout of alms1 in zebrafish recapitulates Alström syndrome and provides insight into metabolic phenotypes.||||||||Alström syndrome (OMIM #203800) is an autosomal recessive obesity ciliopathy caused by loss-of-function mutations in the ALMS1 gene. In addition to multi-organ dysfunction, such as cardiomyopathy, retinal degeneration and renal dysfunction, the disorder is characterized by high rates of obesity, insulin resistance and early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). To investigate the underlying mechanisms of T2DM phenotypes, we generated a loss-of-function deletion of alms1 in the zebrafish. We demonstrate conservation of hallmark clinical characteristics alongside metabolic syndrome phenotypes, including a propensity for obesity and fatty livers, hyperinsulinemia and glucose response defects. Gene expression changes in β-cells isolated from alms1-/- mutants revealed changes consistent with insulin hypersecretion and glucose sensing failure, which were corroborated in cultured murine β-cells lacking Alms1. We also found evidence of defects in peripheral glucose uptake and concomitant hyperinsulinemia in the alms1-/- animals. We propose a model in which hyperinsulinemia is the primary and causative defect underlying generation of T2DM associated with alms1 deficiency. These observations support the alms1 loss-of-function zebrafish mutant as a monogenic model for mechanistic interrogation of T2DM phenotypes.

Two new therapies-inotersen, an antisense oligonucleotide therapy, and patisiran, an RNA interference therapy-received marketing authorization and represent a significant advance in the treatment of amyloidosis. Herein, we describe the clinical presentation of ATTR, commonly used procedures in its diagnosis, and current treatment landscape for ATTR, with a focus on hATTR.||||A PubMed search from 2008 to September 2018 was conducted to review the literature on ATTR.||||Until recently, there have been few treatment options for polyneuropathy of hATTR. Inotersen and patisiran substantially reduce the amyloidogenic precursor protein transthyretin and have demonstrated efficacy in patients with early- and late-stage disease and in slowing or improving neuropathy progression. In contrast, established therapies, such as liver transplantation, typically reserved for patients with early-stage disease, and tafamidis, indicated for the treatment of early-stage disease in Europe, or diflunisal, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is used off-label, are associated with side effects and/or unclear efficacy in certain patient populations. Thus, inotersen and patisiran are positioned to be the preferred therapeutic modalities.||||Important differences between inotersen and patisiran, including formulation, dosing, requirements for premedications, and safety monitoring, require an understanding and knowledge of each treatment for informed decision making.

Typical presentation includes a triad of cardiac arrhythmia, dysmorphia, and periodic paralysis. However, KCNJ2 mutations can mimic other disorders such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) making treatment challenging.||||A 9-year-old asymptomatic female patient presented with an irregular heart rate noted at a well-child visit. Physical examination revealed short stature and facial dysmorphism. An initial rhythm strip showed intermittent runs of non-sustained bidirectional ventricular tachycardia with a prolonged QT interval of 485 ms at rest. Exercise testing showed no significant increase in ectopy from baseline at higher heart rates. Cardiac imaging was normal, and the burden of ventricular ectopy was significantly reduced on a beta-blocker and Class IC antiarrhythmic combination. Genetic testing marked a D71N mutation in the KCNJ2 gene.||||Clinical distinction between ATS and CPVT is a challenge. Genetic testing in the above patient attributed a likely pathogenic variant for both ATS and CPVT to a single D71N mutation in the KCNJ2 gene. Further evaluation revealed no clinical CPVT, emphasizing the need for cautious interpretation of genetic results in inherited arrhythmia disorders.

Early and late auditory information processing show opposing deviations in aniridia.||||||||Aniridia is a congenital disorder, predominantly caused by heterozygous mutations of the PAX6 gene. While ocular defects have been extensively characterized in this population, brain-related anatomical and functional abnormalities are emerging as a prominent feature of the disorder. Individuals with aniridia frequently exhibit auditory processing deficits despite normal audiograms. While previous studies have reported hypoplasia of the anterior commissure and corpus callosum in some of these individuals, the neurophysiological basis of these impairments remains unexplored. This study provides direct assessment of neural activity related to auditory processing in aniridia. Participants were presented with tones designed to elicit an auditory steady-state response (ASSR) at 22 Hz, 40 Hz, and 84 Hz, and infrequent broadband target tones to maintain attention during electroencephalography (EEG) recording. Persons with aniridia showed increased early cortical responses (P50 AEP) in response to all tones, and increased high-frequency oscillatory entrainment (84 Hz ASSR). In contrast, this group showed a decreased cortical integration response (P300 AEP to target tones) and reduced neural entrainment to cortical beta-band stimuli (22 Hz ASSR). Collectively, our results suggest that subcortical and early cortical auditory processing is augmented in aniridia, while functional cortical integration of auditory information is deficient in this population.

Early treatment includes steroid treatment that has been analized and personalized for each case. Early treatment of cardiomyopathy with ACE inhibitors is recommended and referral for cardiac transplantation is appropriate in severe cases. Management includes multidisciplinary care with physiotherapy to reduce joint contractures and prolong walking. BMD is slowly progressive with phenotypic variability. Despite childhood onset, independent walking is never lost before the third decade. Personalized medicine is required to tailor treatment to individual cases.

Clinical and molecular spectrum of CHOPS syndrome.||||||||CHOPS syndrome is a multisystem disorder caused by missense mutations in AFF4. Previously, we reported three individuals whose primary phenotype included cognitive impairment and coarse facies, heart defects, obesity, pulmonary involvement, and short stature. This syndrome overlaps phenotypically with Cornelia de Lange syndrome, but presents distinct differences including facial features, pulmonary involvement, and obesity. Here, we provide clinical descriptions of an additional eight individuals with CHOPS syndrome, as well as neurocognitive analysis of three individuals. All 11 individuals presented with features reminiscent of Cornelia de Lange syndrome such as synophrys, upturned nasal tip, arched eyebrows, and long eyelashes. All 11 individuals had short stature and obesity. Congenital heart disease and pulmonary involvement were common, and those were seen in about 70% of individuals with CHOPS syndrome. Skeletal abnormalities are also common, and those include abnormal shape of vertebral bodies, hypoplastic long bones, and low bone mineral density. Our observation indicates that obesity, pulmonary involvement, skeletal findings are the most notable features distinguishing CHOPS syndrome from Cornelia de Lange syndrome. In fact, two out of eight of our newly identified patients were found to have AFF4 mutations by targeted AFF4 mutational analysis rather than exome sequencing. These phenotypic findings establish CHOPS syndrome as a distinct, clinically recognizable disorder. Additionally, we report three novel missense mutations causative for CHOPS syndrome that lie within the highly conserved, 14 amino acid sequence of the ALF homology domain of the AFF4 gene, emphasizing the critical functional role of this region in human development.

Pathophysiology of Cystic Fibrosis Liver Disease: A Channelopathy Leading to Alterations in Innate Immunity and in Microbiota.||||||||Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic disease caused by mutation of Cftr. CF-associated liver disease (CFLD) is a common nonpulmonary cause of mortality in CF and accounts for approximately 2.5%-5% of overall CF mortality. The peak of the disease is in the pediatric population, but a second wave of liver disease in CF adults has been reported in the past decade in association with an increase in the life expectancy of these patients. New drugs are available to correct the basic defect in CF but their efficacy in CFLD is not known. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, expressed in the apical membrane of cholangiocytes, is a major determinant for bile secretion and CFLD classically has been considered a channelopathy. However, the recent findings of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator as a regulator of epithelial innate immunity and the possible influence of the intestinal disease with an altered microbiota on the liver complication have opened new mechanistic insights on the pathogenesis of CFLD. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and discusses a potential target for intervention.

Neither MetS nor antihypertensive drugs had any apparent effect on OS.||||Our result suggests that, among CRC patients with MetS, taking metformin and statins may improve overall survival, whereas being on insulin may negatively impact CRC prognosis. Further studies are warranted to determine the exact mechanism through which metformin, statins, and insulin exert their effects on CRC survival.

Cyclin D1 + large B-cell lymphoma with altered CCND1 and BCL-6 rearrangements: a diagnostic challenge.||||||||A subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma may show aberrant cyclin D1 expression, which may be confused with blastoid mantle cell lymphoma. These cases usually lack of CCND1 gene rearrangement. Duplication of CCND1 gene was attributed to some of the cases with cyclin D1 expression. The mechanism of overexpression of CCND1 in other cases was not well documented.||||We report a case of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with cyclin D1 expression. The underlying mechanism for cyclin D1 expression was due to an abnormal gene rearrangement involving BCL-6 and CCND1, which was different from most reported cases. Rare cases with similar genetic profile were reported and were classified as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.||||The phenotype and genetic abnormalities of DLBCL with cyclin D1 overexpression can be complex and may be difficult to differentiate from blastoid and pleomorphic variants of mantle cell lymphoma.

Treatment selection for patients with equivocal HER2 status and in luminal versus HER2-enriched disease.||||||||Equivocal HER2 status has been variably defined in the past, and its clinical implications have long been debated. In the 2018 focused update, ASCO/CAP guidelines recommended that tumours with double-equivocal (by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization assays) HER2 status should be considered HER2-negative due to the lack of evidence for any benefit of HER2-targeted therapy. The biology and the response to systemic therapies of tumours co-expressing HR and HER2 is quite complex. There is an extensive bi-directional cross-talk between these 2 pathways, that may result in both intrinsic and acquired resistance to endocrine agents, as well as in lower sensitivity to HER2-targeted therapies. In fact, neoadjuvant studies indicate that pCR rates are significantly lower in HER2-positive/ER-positive than ER-negative tumours, regardless the type of HER2 targeted treatment. The recent identification of different subtypes of HER2-positive breast cancer, according to the co-expression of HR and/or the molecular (intrinsic) subtyping, has prompted a renewed interest for clinical studies aimed at better tailoring the systemic therapy for these patients. A subgroup of them might not need chemotherapy if treated with dual HER2 blockade, and this option has been tested in a number of neo-adjuvant trials. In addition, triple targeting of HR, HER2, and CDK4/6 pathways simultaneously may be an effective treatment and overcome the drug resistance mechanisms that are typical of the disease. Finally, HER2-positive breast cancer may well benefit from immunotherapeutic interventions with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) agents.

Progranulin sustains STAT3 hyper-activation and oncogenic function in colorectal cancer cells.||||||||Persistent activation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT)3 occurs in a high percentage of tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC), thereby contributing to malignant cell proliferation and survival. Although STAT3 is recognized as an attractive therapeutic target in CRC, conventional approaches aimed at inhibiting its functions have met with several limitations. Moreover, the factors that sustain hyper-activation of STAT3 in CRC are not yet fully understood. The identification of tumor-specific STAT3 cofactors may facilitate the development of compounds that interfere exclusively with STAT3 activity in cancer cells. Here, we show that progranulin, a STAT3 cofactor, is upregulated in human CRC as compared to nontumor tissue/cells and its expression correlates with STAT3 activation. Progranulin physically interacts with STAT3 in CRC cells, and its knockdown with a specific antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) inhibits STAT3 activation and restrains the expression of STAT3-related oncogenic proteins, thus causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, progranulin knockdown reduces STAT3 phosphorylation and cell proliferation induced by tumor-infiltrating leukocyte (TIL)-derived supernatants in CRC cell lines and human CRC explants. These findings indicate that CRC exhibits overexpression of progranulin, and suggest a role for this protein in amplifying the STAT3 pathway in CRC.

As previously shown for other types of cancer-associated fibroblasts, treatment by luteolin could reverse this fibroblast phenotype and decrease TIMP3 secretion. NS cHL fibroblasts showed enhanced proliferation when they were exposed to soluble factors released from HRS cells. For HRS cells, soluble factors from fibroblasts were not sufficient to protect them from Brentuximab-Vedotin induced cell death. However, HRS cells adherent to fibroblasts were protected from Brentuximab-Vedotin induced injury. In summary, we confirm the importance of fibroblasts for HRS cell survival and identify TIMP3 which probably contributes as a major factor to the typical fibrosis observed in NS cHL.

Changes of serum lipopolysaccharide, inflammatory factors, and cecal microbiota in obese rats with type 2 diabetes induced by Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.||||||||Previous studies have shown that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) leads to rapid regression of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of RYGB on serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and cecal microbiota in obese rats with T2D.||||Obese Sprague-Dawley rats with T2D were randomly divided into RYGB diabetes operation (DO; n = 8), diabetes sham operation (DS; n = 8), and diabetic control (DC; n = 8) groups. Healthy Sprague-Dawley rats were grouped as normal control (NC; n = 8). Fasting plasma glucose and body weight were measured. The levels of peripheral serum LPS, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The rats were sacrificed 12 wk after operation. Subsequently, a superior mesenteric venous blood sample was taken to measure serum LPS levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The cecal contents of the DO and DS groups were taken to extract metagenomic DNA per the genomic DNA standardization procedure. The V4 region of the 16 S rRNA was sequenced with the Illumina Hiseq sequencing platform to compare the structure and relative abundance of cecal microbiota between the DO and DS groups.||||Twelve weeks after operation in the DO group, fasting plasma glucose and body weight showed a significant decrease (P < 0.05). Moreover, the levels of peripheral serum LPS, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α were obviously decreased (P < 0.05). A change in the LPS level of superior mesenteric venous blood also revealed a dramatic decrease (P < 0.05). Additionally, RYGB resulted in a shift of cecal microbiota in obese rats with T2D.||||Hypoglycemic effects after RYGB may be associated with improved levels of LPS, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α. Changes in the structure of cecal microbiota may also play an important role.

Homeostatic Model Assessment in Kidney Transplantation.||||||||Long-term kidney transplantation survival has been limited to cardiovascular-disease-associated death, which may be related to insulin resistance. The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) and renal graft function.||||From January 2013 to March 2015, 55 nondiabetic kidney recipients were reviewed retrospectively with their baseline fasting serum insulin and glucose levels as the basis the following indexes: 1. HOMA insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), 2. HOMA-β, and 3. insulin-glucose ratio (IGR). These patients were divided into 2 groups according to their HOMA indexes, and the serum creatinine (Cr) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were analyzed on the basis of every 6 months up to 3 years after kidney transplantation. Finally, we evaluate whether these HOMA indexes are a determinant factor of eGFR at post-transplant 1 year, 2 year, and 3 year.||||There was no persisting difference in Cr and eGFR between high- and low-HOMA indexes except that the Cr and eGFR difference by HOMA-β stratification increased with time and became nearly significant at 3 years after transplantation. Further univariate and multivariate linear regression models showed no factor affected the 1-year eGFR independently, while weight affected the 2-year eGFR and only HOMA-β affected the 3-year eGFR independently.||||In non-diabetic kidney recipients, the eGFR difference between high- and low-HOMA-β patients increases over time. In multivariate linear regression, HOMA-β, but not HOMA-IR nor IGR, has independent significant association with eGFR at 3 years after transplantation.

New treatment modalities with vaccine therapy in renal cell carcinoma.||||||||The aim of implementing vaccine therapy is to activate immune response against malignant cells by overcoming the tolerance triggered by the tumor. These treatments are effective using the immune response against cancer. Not every type of cancer is suitable for vaccine therapies. For a vaccine therapy to be implemented, cancer should be immunogenic and contain tissue-specific proteins, should have a slow progression, and treatments should be feasible. For that reason, studies regarding urological cancers are mostly focused on the kidneys and the prostate. Vaccine therapies used in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can be categorized under the following titles: autologous tumor cells, dendritic cells, genetically modified tumor cells, and protein/peptide. Although there are old studies on the implementation of vaccine therapies in RCC, researches have only been intensified recently. In addition to their effective potential for lengthening general survival, decreasing tumor burden and cancer development in long term, vaccine treatments are especially effective in metastatic RCC patients. We think that vaccine treatments would be applied more in near future since RCC are immunogenic. In this compilation, we will discuss vaccine therapies used in RCC, which urologists are not so familiar with, in the light of the up-to-date literature.

CAF hierarchy driven by pancreatic cancer cell p53-status creates a pro-metastatic and chemoresistant environment via perlecan.||||||||Heterogeneous subtypes of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) coexist within pancreatic cancer tissues and can both promote and restrain disease progression. Here, we interrogate how cancer cells harboring distinct alterations in p53 manipulate CAFs. We reveal the existence of a p53-driven hierarchy, where cancer cells with a gain-of-function (GOF) mutant p53 educate a dominant population of CAFs that establish a pro-metastatic environment for GOF and null p53 cancer cells alike. We also demonstrate that CAFs educated by null p53 cancer cells may be reprogrammed by either GOF mutant p53 cells or their CAFs. We identify perlecan as a key component of this pro-metastatic environment. Using intravital imaging, we observe that these dominant CAFs delay cancer cell response to chemotherapy. Lastly, we reveal that depleting perlecan in the stroma combined with chemotherapy prolongs mouse survival, supporting it as a potential target for anti-stromal therapies in pancreatic cancer.

Acute myeloid leukemia-induced T-cell suppression can be reversed by inhibition of the MAPK pathway.||||||||Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains difficult to treat due to mutational heterogeneity and the development of resistance to therapy. Targeted agents, such as MEK inhibitors, may be incorporated into treatment; however, the impact of MEK inhibitors on the immune microenvironment in AML is not well understood. A greater understanding of the implications of MEK inhibition on immune responses may lead to a greater understanding of immune evasion and more rational combinations with immunotherapies. This study describes the impact of trametinib on both T cells and AML blast cells by using an immunosuppressive mouse model of AML and primary patient samples. We also used a large AML database of functional drug screens to understand characteristics of trametinib-sensitive samples. In the mouse model, trametinib increased T-cell viability and restored T-cell proliferation. Importantly, we report greater proliferation in the CD8+CD44+ effector subpopulation and impaired activation of CD8+CD62L+ naive cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed that trametinib-sensitive samples have an inflammatory gene expression profile, and we also observed increased programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on trametinib-sensitive samples. Finally, we found that trametinib consistently reduced PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in a dose-dependent manner on the myeloid population. Altogether, our data present greater insight into the impact of trametinib on the immune microenvironment and characteristics of trametinib-sensitive patient samples.

Tumor-specific inhibitory action of decorin on different hepatoma cell lines.||||||||In spite of therapeutic approaches, liver cancer is still one of the deadliest type of tumor in which tumor microenvironment may play an active role in the outcome of the disease. Decorin, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan is not only responsible for assembly and maintenance of the integrity of the extracellular matrix, but a natural inhibitor of cell surface receptors, thus it exerts antitumorigenic effects. Here we addressed the question whether this effect of decorin is independent of the tumor phenotypes including differentiation, proliferation and invasion.||||Four hepatoma cell lines HepG2, Hep3B, HuH7 and HLE, possessing different molecular backgrounds, were selected to investigate. After proliferation tests, pRTK arrays, WB analyses, and immunofluorescent examinations were performed on decorin treated and control cells for comparison.||||, increased inactivation of c-myc and β-catenin, and decrease of EGFR, GSK3β and ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels were observed in HepG2 cells, pathways already well-described in literature. However, in the p53 deficient Hep3B and HuH7, InsR and IGF-1R were the main receptors transmitting signals. In harmony with its receptor status, Hep3B cells displayed high level of activated AKT. As the cell line is retinoblastoma mutant, ATR/Chk1/Wee1 system might hinder the cell cycle in G2/M phase via phosphorylation of CDK1. In Huh7 cells, all RTKs were inhibited by decorin followed by downregulation of AKT. Furthermore, HuH7 cell line responded with concentration-dependent ERK activation and increased phospho-c-myc level. Decorin had only a non-significant effect on the proliferation rate of HLE cell line. However, it responded with a significant decrease of pAKT, c-myc and β-catenin activity. In this special cell line, the inhibition of TGFβ may be the first step of the protective effect of decorin.||||Based on our results decorin may be a candidate therapeutic agent in the battle against liver cancer, but several questions need to be answered. It is certain that decorin is capable to exert its suppressor effect in hepatoma cells without respect to their phenotype and molecular background.

MLE‑12 cells were exposed to air or hyperoxia with or without pretreatment with LXA4, Zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP‑IX), IL‑6, anti‑IL‑6, MCP‑1, anti‑MCP‑1, inhibitors of p38 mitogen‑activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), protein kinase B (Akt) and extracellular signal‑regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathways. The cell survival rates, cell viability, apoptosis rates, expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD), heme oxygenase‑1 (HO‑1), IL‑6 and MCP‑1, and the activations of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and Akt were measured. LXA4 significantly increased the cell survival rates, cell viability, SOD levels and HO‑1 expression, reduced the apoptosis rates, and inhibited the MCP‑1 and IL‑6 levels induced by hyperoxia in cells. ZnPP‑IX, an inhibitor of HO‑1, blocked LXA4‑induced protection on cell viability in cells exposed to hyperoxia. Anti‑IL‑6 and anti‑MCP‑1 improved the cell viability of cells exposed to hyperoxia. Inhibition of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 blocked the expression of MCP‑1 and IL‑6 induced by hyperoxia. LXA4 inhibited the activation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 induced by hyperoxia, and increased the activation of the Akt signaling pathway, which was inhibited by hyperoxia. Therefore, LXA4 attenuated hyperoxia‑induced injury in MLE‑12 cells via the upregulation of HO‑1 expression. The protection of LXA4 in hyperoxia‑induced cell injury may be associated with the downregulation IL‑6 and MCP‑1 levels via the inhibition of the p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of hyperglycemia on proliferating, differentiating and maturating human visceral pre/adipocytes (HPA-v). Three stages of cell culture were conducted under constant or variable glycemic conditions. Adipogenesis progress was assessed using BODIPY 505/515 staining. Lipid content typical for normal and hyperglycemic conditions of adipocytes was analyzed using Raman spectroscopy and imaging. Expression of adipogenic markers, PPARγ and C/EBPα, was determined at the mRNA and protein levels. We also examined expression of miRNAs proven to target PPARγ (miR-34a-5p) and C/EBPα (miR-137-3p), employing TaqMan Low-Density Arrays (TLDA) cards. Hyperglycemia altered morphology of differentiating HPA-v in relation to normoglycemia by accelerating the formation of lipid droplets and making their numbers and volume increase. Raman results confirmed that the qualitative and quantitative lipid composition under normal and hyperglycemic conditions were different, and that the number of lipid droplets increased in (HG)-treated cells. Expression profiles of both examined genes markedly changed either during adipogenesis under physiological and hyperglycemic conditions, orat particular stages of adipogenesis upon chronic and/or variable glycemia. Expression levels of PPARγ seemed to correspond to some expression changes of miR-34a-5p. miR-137-3p, whose expression was rather stable throughout the culture, did not seem to affect C/EBPα. Our observations revealed that chronic and intermittent hyperglycemia change the morphology of visceral pre/adipocytes during adipogenesis. Moreover, hyperglycemia may utilize miR-34a-5p to induce some expression changes in PPARγ.

The Role of Insulin Resistance and Protein O-GlcNAcylation in Neurodegeneration.||||||||Metabolic syndrome including obesity and type 2 diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide. Similarly, there has been an increase in the cases of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) possibility due to increase in elderly population in the past few decades. Both, metabolic diseases and AD have one common feature that is insulin resistance. Recent studies suggest a link between the regulatory functions of insulin in the brain and AD. Hypoglycemia, a characteristic feature of AD may be a result of impaired insulin signaling in the affected regions of the brain. O-GlcNAcylation is a post-translational protein modification, the levels of which are dependent on the availability of glucose inside the cells. Hyperphosphorylation of Tau is a major molecular feature, which leads to its aggregation and neurotoxicity in AD. In addition, impaired processing of Amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to toxic amyloid β (Aβ) aggregation is also implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Both APP and Tau are also found to be O-GlcNAcylated. Reduced O-GlcNAcylation of APP and Tau due to hypoglycemia is found to be associated with their pathological features in AD brain. Recent studies have also identified perturbed O-GlcNAcylation/phosphorylation of several other proteins important for normal neuronal function, which may be contributing to the neuropathological development in AD. Herein, we discuss about the uptake and distribution of insulin inside the brain, brain insulin signaling and insulin resistance as well as its relation to neurodegenerative diseases with a special focus on protein O-GlcNAcylation and its potential role in the treatment of AD.

CRISPR/Cas9 Screens Reveal Multiple Layers of B cell CD40 Regulation.||||||||CD40 has major roles in B cell development, activation, and germinal center responses. CD40 hypoactivity causes immunodeficiency whereas its overexpression causes autoimmunity and lymphomagenesis. To systematically identify B cell autonomous CD40 regulators, we use CRISPR/Cas9 genome-scale screens in Daudi B cells stimulated by multimeric CD40 ligand. These highlight known CD40 pathway components and reveal multiple additional mechanisms regulating CD40. The nuclear ubiquitin ligase FBXO11 supports CD40 expression by targeting repressors CTBP1 and BCL6. FBXO11 knockout decreases primary B cell CD40 abundance and impairs class-switch recombination, suggesting that frequent lymphoma monoallelic FBXO11 mutations may balance BCL6 increase with CD40 loss. At the mRNA level, CELF1 controls exon splicing critical for CD40 activity, while the N6-adenosine methyltransferase WTAP negatively regulates CD40 mRNA abundance. At the protein level, ESCRT negatively regulates activated CD40 levels while the negative feedback phosphatase DUSP10 limits downstream MAPK responses. These results serve as a resource for future studies and highlight potential therapeutic targets.

MD2 blockade prevents oxLDL-induced renal epithelial cell injury and protects against high-fat-diet-induced kidney dysfunction.||||||||There is a strong epidemiological link between obesity, a growing worldwide concern, and kidney disease. Emerging evidence indicates that the pathogenic basis of obesity-related kidney disease may be attributed to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) of the innate immune system. We hypothesized that renal epithelial cell injury in response to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) requires myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD2), a co-receptor of TLR4. Moreover, we also hypothesized that renal dysfunction is MD2-dependent in the high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model. Results indicated that the MD2 selective inhibitor (L6H21) abrogated the oxLDL-induced formation of MD2-TLR4 dimerization in the renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line NRK-52E. Further, MD2 blockade in NRK-52E cells using siRNA target sequences or L6H21 prevented oxLDL-induced cell injury as indicated by expression of profibrotic molecules, autophagic activity and apoptosis. Similarly, TLR4 knockdown in NRK-52E cells using siRNA target sequences prevented oxLDL-induced cell injury. In the HFD mouse model, MD2 knockout protected against development of kidney dysfunction and renal tissue injury, corroborating the observations observed in NRK-52E cells. Thus, the oxLDL-induced renal tubular epithelial cell profibrotic responses, autophagy and apoptosis were dependent on MD2, as were the renal dysfunction and tissue impairment in HFD mice. These are new findings indicating that the MD2-TLR4 immune signaling complex is a critical pathogenic factor in the development of kidney disease related to obesity or metabolic syndrome.

Can Healthy Diets, Regular Exercise, and Better Lifestyle Delay the Progression of Dementia in Elderly Individuals?||||||||Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss and multiple cognitive impairments. Current healthcare costs for over 50 million people afflicted with AD are about $818 million and are projected to be $2 billion by 2050. Unfortunately, there are no drugs currently available that can delay and/or prevent the progression of disease in elderly individuals and in AD patients. Loss of synapses and synaptic damage are largely correlated with cognitive decline in AD patients. Women are at a higher lifetime risk of developing AD encompassing two-thirds of the total AD afflicted population. Only about 1-2% of total AD patients can be explained by genetic mutations in APP, PS1, and PS2 genes. Several risk factors have been identified, such as Apolipoprotein E4 genotype, type 2 diabetes, traumatic brain injury, depression, and hormonal imbalance, are reported to be associated with late-onset AD. Strong evidence reveals that antioxidant enriched diets and regular exercise reduces toxic radicals, enhances mitochondrial function and synaptic activity, and improves cognitive function in elderly populations. Current available data on the use of antioxidants in mouse models of AD and antioxidant(s) supplements in diets of elderly individuals were investigated. The use of antioxidants in randomized clinical trials in AD patients was also critically assessed. Based on our survey of current literature and findings, we cautiously conclude that healthy diets, regular exercise, and improved lifestyle can delay dementia progression and reduce the risk of AD in elderly individuals and reverse subjects with mild cognitive impairment to a non-demented state.

Effect of Diabetes Mellitus on Complication Rates of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting.||||||||Previous studies have shown that diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor for postoperative coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) complications. More contemporary studies are needed to guide revascularization decisions in DM patients. We performed a single-center study of patients who underwent CABG. Patients with no DM were compared with patients with DM, subgrouped according to whether or not DM was treated with insulin before admission (Insulin and No Insulin Groups). Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine whether DM was a significant predictor of mortality, combined postoperative events, and specific postoperative complications after controlling for other predictive clinical variables. Of 11,590 consecutive patients who underwent CABG, 5,013 (43%) had DM and 6,577 (57%) had no DM. Of the patients with DM, 3,433 (68%) were not treated with insulin and 1,580 (32%) were treated with insulin before admission. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that DM was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality or combined postoperative events after considering other clinical variables. The No Insulin Group was significantly associated with stroke, and the Insulin Group was significantly associated with surgical site infection and new renal failure. In conclusion, this study of consecutively treated CABG patients shows that DM is not a predictor of in-hospital mortality or combined in-hospital postoperative events after adjusting for other clinical factors. DM is a predictor of permanent stroke, surgical site infection, and new renal failure. These findings may help with case selection and management of DM patients undergoing CABG.

AD TLR3 deficiency can underlie herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) encephalitis (HSE) by impairing cortical neuron-intrinsic type I IFN immunity to HSV-1. TLR3-mutated leukocytes produce normal levels of IFNs in response to IAV. In contrast, TLR3-mutated fibroblasts produce lower levels of IFN-β and -λ, and display enhanced viral susceptibility, upon IAV infection. Moreover, the patients' iPSC-derived pulmonary epithelial cells (PECs) are susceptible to IAV. Treatment with IFN-α2b or IFN-λ1 rescues this phenotype. AD TLR3 deficiency may thus underlie IAV-ARDS by impairing TLR3-dependent, type I and/or III IFN-mediated, PEC-intrinsic immunity. Its clinical penetrance is incomplete for both IAV-ARDS and HSE, consistent with their typically sporadic nature.

In vitro evidence consistent with an interaction between wild-type and mutant SOD1 protein associated with canine degenerative myelopathy.||||||||Canine degenerative myelopathy (DM) is a progressive neurological disorder that may be considered to be a large animal model for specific forms of the fatal human disease, familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS). DM is associated with a c118G>A mutation of the superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1) gene, and a significant proportion of cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner in contrast to the largely, but not exclusively, dominant mode of inheritance in fALS. The consensus view is that these Sod1/SOD1 mutations result in a toxic gain of function but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here we used an in vitro neuroblastoma cell line transfection system to monitor wild-type and mutant forms of SOD1 fusion proteins containing either a Cherry or an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tag. These fusion proteins retained SOD1 enzymatic activity on a native gel assay system. We demonstrate that SOD1 aggregate density is significantly higher in DM transfectants compared to wild-type. In addition, we show by co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy, evidence for a potential interaction between wild-type and mutant forms of SOD1 in co-transfected cells. While in vitro studies have shown SOD1 heterodimer formation in fALS models, this is the first report for DM SOD1. Therefore, despite for the majority of cases there is a difference in the mode of inheritance between fALS and DM, a similar interaction between wild-type and mutant SOD1 forms can occur. Clarifying the role of SOD1 in DM may also be of benefit to understanding the role of SOD1 in fALS.

Genetic Causes of Rare Pediatric Ovarian Tumors.||||||||Ovarian tumors in childhood and adolescence are distinguished from those that arise in adulthood by their histological subtype. These tumors may arise as the first manifestation of a cancer predisposition syndrome. Correct diagnosis of the syndrome may offer the possibility of surveillance for other members of the patients family.||||To summarize current knowledge about paediatric ovarian tumors that may be associated with genetically defined cancer syndromes. Juvenile granulosa cell tumors occur in those with Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome; they are caused by postzygotic IDH1 and IDH2 gene mutations. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors usually arise in association with DICER1 syndrome, which is caused by germline DICER1 gene mutations. Sex cord tumors with annular tubules and Sertoli cell tumors may arise in patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome; this syndrome is caused by germline STK11 gene mutations. The majority of germ cell tumors develop in the context of gonadal dysgenesis. In XY gonadal dysgenesis, the presence of a Y chromosome material renders the patient at increased risk for developing gonadal malignancy. Characteristically, these patients develop gonadoblastoma, which has the potential to evolve into dysgerminoma and exhibit malignant behavior. Sex-chromosome aneuploidy syndromes or mutations in genes involved in gonadal development and differentiation may cause gonadal dysgenesis. Small cell carcinoma of the ovary of a hypercalcaemic type is usually caused by loss-of-function mutations in the SMARCA4 gene.||||Ovarian tumors are uncommon during childhood and adolescence. It is always necessary to consider gonadal dysgenesis or any of the inherited cancer syndromes. These patients require interdisciplinary care, careful noting of personal and family history, precise clinical examination, laboratory testing, and differential diagnosis by a clinician with a good knowledge of genetic syndromes. Expert pathological review may be required for correct diagnoses. This is necessary for appropriate management and to establish an association with hereditary cancer syndromes.

Proteomic analysis of exosome-enriched fractions derived from cerebrospinal fluid of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients.||||||||Exosomes contain many proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases. To identify new candidate biomarkers and proteins associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry proteomic analysis of exosome-enriched fractions isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of sporadic ALS patients using gel filtration chromatography. Proteomic data revealed that three proteins were increased and 11 proteins were decreased in ALS patients. The protein with the greatest increase in exosome-enriched fractions of CSF derived from ALS was novel INHAT repressor (NIR), which is closely associated with nucleolar function. By immunohistochemical analysis, we found that NIR was reduced in the nucleus of motor neurons in ALS patients. Our results demonstrate the potential utility of our methodology for proteomic analysis of CSF exosomes and suggest that nucleolar stress might play a role in sporadic ALS pathogenesis through the dysfunction of NIR.

Loss of proteins associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis affects lysosomal acidification via different routes.||||||||Abnormal accumulation of proteins is a hallmark of a variety of neurological diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Maintenance of protein homeostasis (proteostasis) in neurons via proteasomal and macroautophagy/autophagy-lysosomal degradation is thought to be central for proper neuronal function and survival. We recently reported evolutionarily conserved roles for two ALS-linked proteins, UBQLN2 (ubiquilin 2) and VAPB, in regulation of lysosomal degradation. Ubiquilins are required for v-ATPase-mediated lysosomal acidification, whereas VAPs are required for the PtdIns4P-mediated endo-lysosomal trafficking pathway.

Cerebrospinal fluid proteomics and biological heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease: A literature review.||||||||Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by aggregation of amyloid and tau proteins in the brain. Results from genetic studies suggest that the pathophysiology underlying AD is complex, but studying this complexity in patients remains difficult. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome contains a large number of proteins that can reflect ongoing biological processes. Proteomics techniques can be used to measure many proteins simultaneously in individual patients and may therefore provide an opportunity to study AD disease mechanisms. Here, we review the CSF proteomics literature to identify proteins consistently associated with AD, and perform pathway analyses on these proteins to study which biological processes may be involved in the disease.We performed a literature search of studies that investigated CSF proteomic alterations related to AD. We included original research articles when they measured at least 10 proteins in (antemortem) CSF in at least 10 individuals with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or controls. We examined if proteins were consistently related to AD, defined as consistent increase or decrease in AD vs. controls across studies. Next, we used the proteins identified as input to pathway analyses using Reactome to investigate which biological processes were enriched.In total, 29 studies were included that investigated AD-related changes to the CSF proteome, including a total of 1434 individuals with AD (of whom 47.1% had a CSF biomarker profile and 9.6% a postmortem examination consistent with AD) and 1380 controls. The studies reported 1 to 138 proteins associated with AD, of which 97 proteins were reported by two or more studies. Among proteins that were measured in more than one study, 27 (27.8%) showed consistent increases, 15 (15.5%) consistent decreases and 55 (56.7%) had contrasting results. Pathway analyses showed that AD-related proteins were enriched for hemostasis, lipoprotein and extracellular matrix pathways.These results indicate that proteomic alterations in CSF associated with AD reflect involvement of various biological pathways. The frequent occurrence of inconsistent protein level changes reported by different studies suggests that additional biological and/or (pre)analytical factors may influence the CSF proteome in AD, which should be further investigated in order to improve understanding of the biological complexity underlying AD.

Crosstalk of intracellular post-translational modifications in cancer.||||||||Post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been reported to play pivotal roles in numerous cellular biochemical and physiological processes. Multiple PTMs can influence the actions of each other positively or negatively, termed as PTM crosstalk or PTM code. During recent years, development of identification strategies for PTMs co-occurrence has revealed abundant information of interplay between PTMs. Increasing evidence demonstrates that deregulation of PTMs crosstalk is involved in the genesis and development of various diseases. Insight into the complexity of PTMs crosstalk will help us better understand etiology and provide novel targets for drug therapy. In the present review, we will discuss the important functional roles of PTMs crosstalk in proteins associated with cancer diseases.

If this were to translate to humans, verifying that such a light stimulus can induce a 40 Hz entrainment response in humans and harnessing insights from these case studies could be one step in the development of a multisensory device to prevent and treat AD.||||Verify the inducement of a 40 Hz response in the human brain by a 40 Hz light stimulus and obtain insights that could potentially aid in the development of a multisensory device for the prevention and treatment of AD.||||Electroencephalographic brain activity was recorded simultaneously with application of stimulus at different frequencies and intensities. Power spectral densities were analyzed.||||Entrainment to visual stimuli occurred with the largest response at 40 Hz. The high intensity 40 Hz stimulus caused widespread entrainment. The number of electrodes demonstrating entrainment increased with increasing light intensity. Largest amplitudes for the high intensity 40 Hz stimulus were consistently found at the primary visual cortex. There was a harmonic effect at double the frequency for the 40 Hz stimulus. An eyes-open protocol caused more entrainment than an eyes-closed protocol.||||It was possible to induce widespread entrainment using a 40 Hz light stimulus in this sample cohort. Insights gleaned from these case studies could potentially aid in the development of a multisensory medical device to prevent and treat AD.

Physiological, Pathological, and Targetable Membraneless Organelles in Neurons.||||||||Neurons require unique subcellular compartmentalization to function efficiently. Formed from proteins and RNAs through liquid-liquid phase separation, membraneless organelles (MLOs) have emerged as one way in which cells form distinct, specialized compartments in the absence of lipid membranes. We first discuss MLOs that are common to many cell types as well as those that are specific to neurons. Interestingly, many proteins associated with neurodegenerative disease are found in MLOs, particularly in stress and transport granules. We next review possible links between neurodegeneration and MLOs, and the hypothesis that the protein and RNA inclusions formed in disease are related to the functional complexes occurring inside these MLOs. Finally, we discuss the hypothesis that protein post-translational modifications (PTMs), which can alter phase separation, can modulate MLO formation and provide potential new therapeutic strategies for currently untreatable neurodegenerative diseases.

N-terminal sequences in matrin 3 mediate phase separation into droplet-like structures that recruit TDP43 variants lacking RNA binding elements.||||||||RNA binding proteins associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and muscle myopathy possess sequence elements that are low in complexity, or bear resemblance to yeast prion domains. These sequence elements appear to mediate phase separation into liquid-like membraneless organelles. Using fusion proteins of matrin 3 (MATR3) to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), we recently observed that deletion of the second RNA recognition motif (RRM2) caused the protein to phase separate and form intranuclear liquid-like droplets. Here, we use fusion constructs of MATR3, TARDBP43 (TDP43) and FUS with YFP or mCherry to examine phase separation and protein colocalization in mouse C2C12 myoblast cells. We observed that the N-terminal 397 amino acids of MATR3 (tagged with a nuclear localization signal and expressed as a fusion protein with YFP) formed droplet-like structures within nuclei. Introduction of the myopathic S85C mutation into NLS-N397 MATR3:YFP, but not ALS mutations F115C or P154S, inhibited droplet formation. Further, we analyzed interactions between variants of MATR3 lacking RRM2 (ΔRRM2) and variants of TDP43 with disabling mutations in its RRM1 domain (deletion or mutation). We observed that MATR3:YFP ΔRRM2 formed droplets that appeared to recruit the TDP43 RRM1 mutants. Further, coexpression of the NLS-397 MATR3:YFP construct with a construct that encodes the prion-like domain of TDBP43 produced intranuclear droplet-like structures containing both proteins. Collectively, our studies show that N-terminal sequences in MATR3 can mediate phase separation into intranuclear droplet-like structures that can recruit TDP43 under conditions of low RNA binding.

An Improved Prediction Model for Ovarian Cancer Using Urinary Biomarkers and a Novel Validation Strategy.||||||||This study was designed to analyze urinary proteins associated with ovarian cancer (OC) and investigate the potential urinary biomarker panel to predict malignancy in women with pelvic masses. We analyzed 23 biomarkers in urine samples obtained from 295 patients with pelvic masses scheduled for surgery. The concentration of urinary biomarkers was quantitatively assessed by the xMAP bead-based multiplexed immunoassay. To identify the performance of each biomarker in predicting cancer over benign tumors, we used a repeated leave-group-out cross-validation strategy. The prediction models using multimarkers were evaluated to develop a urinary ovarian cancer panel. After the exclusion of 12 borderline tumors, the urinary concentration of 17 biomarkers exhibited significant differences between 158 OCs and 125 benign tumors. Human epididymis protein 4 (HE4), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), and transthyretin (TTR) were the top three biomarkers representing a higher concentration in OC. HE4 demonstrated the highest performance in all samples withOC(mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.822, 95% CI: 0.772-0.869), whereas TTR showed the highest efficacy in early-stage OC (AUC 0.789, 95% CI: 0.714-0.856). Overall, HE4 was the most informative biomarker, followed by creatinine, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), and TTR using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression models. A multimarker panel consisting of HE4, creatinine, CEA, and TTR presented the best performance with 93.7% sensitivity (SN) at 70.6% specificity (SP) to predict OC over the benign tumor. This panel performed well regardless of disease status and demonstrated an improved performance by including menopausal status. In conclusion, the urinary biomarker panel with HE4, creatinine, CEA, and TTR provided promising efficacy in predicting OC over benign tumors in women with pelvic masses. It was also a non-invasive and easily available diagnostic tool.

SPLUNC1 and MLL3 regulate cancer stem cells in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.||||||||Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the common types of cancer that originate from the nasopharyngeal region. Recurrence and early metastasis represent major problems associated with NPC mortality. These are mainly caused by various molecular changes that take place during the conversion of normal stem cells into treatment-resistant stem cells. The aim of our study was to investigate the proliferative behavior of cancer stem cells in different stages of NPC and to identify the functional roles of SPLUNC1 and MLL3 associated with cancer stem cells.||||We successfully developed a NPC mouse model using C666-1 cells. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were used to analyze the expression of SOX2, SPLUNC1 and MLL3.||||Null BALB/c mice developed initial and aggressive stages of NPC in 3 and 10 weeks, respectively. Histological results showed that the proliferative ability of cells increased as the tumor progressed to the next level. The SOX2 protein showed a peculiar pattern of upregulation in aggressive NPC when compared with control tissues and initial NPC. Remarkably, our study found that SPLUNC1 and MLL3 expression showed upregulation in initial NPC, which indicates their role in the tumor resistance mechanism even if their expression was downregulated in aggressive NPC.||||Our results conclude that SPLUNC1 and MLL3 expression control the resistance mechanism of cancer stem cells in initial NPC, but their downregulation in aggressive stages contributes to developing resistance in nasopharyngeal cancer stem cells.

Loss of SATB1 Induces p21-Dependent Cellular Senescence in Post-mitotic Dopaminergic Neurons.||||||||Cellular senescence is a mechanism used by mitotic cells to prevent uncontrolled cell division. As senescent cells persist in tissues, they cause local inflammation and are harmful to surrounding cells, contributing to aging. Generally, neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's, are disorders of aging. The contribution of cellular senescence to neurodegeneration is still unclear. SATB1 is a DNA binding protein associated with Parkinson's disease. We report that SATB1 prevents cellular senescence in post-mitotic dopaminergic neurons. Loss of SATB1 causes activation of a cellular senescence transcriptional program in dopamine neurons both in human stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons and in mice. We observed phenotypes that are central to cellular senescence in SATB1 knockout dopamine neurons in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we found that SATB1 directly represses expression of the pro-senescence factor p21 in dopaminergic neurons. Our data implicate senescence of dopamine neurons as a contributing factor in the pathology of Parkinson's disease.

They usually appear in middle-aged women, with an average size of 4-7 cm and rapid growth.||||A 25-year-old woman sought care after excision of recurrent nodules in the right breast, with a diagnosis of borderline phyllodes tumor. She had no new lesions on physical examination. Imaging studies revealed an anechoic collection and nodular areas in a previous surgical site, correlated with pathology. Immuno-histochemical examination was positive for vimentin, calponin, Ki-67 and estrogen receptor. Systemic staging did not show metastases. Skin-reducing mastectomy was performed on the right side, followed by reconstruction and left reduction mammaplasty for symmetry. At 8-month follow-up, there was no relapse of the lesions on clinical and ultrasonographic examinations.||||Phyllodes tumors are rare neoplasms characterized by rapid growth, occurring in women between 35-55 years of age. They are classified as benign, borderline and malignant, according to histological parameters. There are reports of genetic mutations in TP53 associated with malignant phyllodes tumor. On immunohistochemistry, there is a greater tendency to malignancy in tumors with Ki-67 and estrogen receptor expression. Imaging methods may aid in diagnosis, which is only definitive after excision and histopathological analysis of the tumor. These tumors have high local recurrence rates and possibility of metastases, closely related to histology.||||Phyllodes tumors are a great challenge to the surgeon. Treatment is surgical, with wide excision; radiotherapy and chemotherapy are controversial.

Little is known about the potential role of DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of CP. This study aimed to explore the potential role of DNA methylation in the mechanism of CP.||||We established an all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced CP model in C57BL/6J mice and used methylation-dependent restriction enzymes (MethylRAD, FspEI) combined with high-throughput sequencing (HiSeq X Ten) to compare genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of embryonic mouse palatal tissues, between embryos from ATRA-treated vs. untreated mice, at embryonic gestation day 14.5 (E14.5) (n=3 per group). To confirm differentially methylated levels of susceptible genes, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to correlate expression of differentially methylated genes related to CP.||||We identified 196 differentially methylated genes, including 17,298 differentially methylated CCGG sites between ATRA-treated vs. untreated embryonic mouse palatal tissues (P<0.05, log2FC>1). The CP-related genes Fgf16 (P=0.008, log2FC=1.13) and Tbx22 (P=0.011, log2FC=1.64,) were hypermethylated. Analysis of Fgf16 and Tbx22, using Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), identified 3 GO terms and 1 KEGG pathway functionally related to palatal fusion. The qPCR showed that changes in expression level negatively correlated with methylation levels.||||Taken together, these results suggest that hypermethylation of Fgf16 and Tbx22 is associated with decreased gene expression, which might be responsible for developmental failure of palatal fusion, eventually resulting in the formation of CP.

Mutations in ELAC2 associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy impair mitochondrial tRNA 3'-end processing.||||||||Mutations in either the mitochondrial or nuclear genomes are associated with a diverse group of human disorders characterized by impaired mitochondrial respiration. Within this group, an increasing number of mutations have been identified in nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial RNA metabolism, including ELAC2. The ELAC2 gene codes for the mitochondrial RNase Z, responsible for endonucleolytic cleavage of the 3' ends of mitochondrial pre-tRNAs. Here, we report the identification of 16 novel ELAC2 variants in individuals presenting with mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and lactic acidosis. We provide evidence for the pathogenicity of the novel missense variants by studying the RNase Z activity in an in vitro system. We also modeled the residues affected by a missense mutation in solved RNase Z structures, providing insight into enzyme structure and function. Finally, we show that primary fibroblasts from the affected individuals have elevated levels of unprocessed mitochondrial RNA precursors. Our study thus broadly confirms the correlation of ELAC2 variants with severe infantile-onset forms of HCM and mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction. One rare missense variant associated with the occurrence of prostate cancer (p.Arg781His) impairs the mitochondrial RNase Z activity of ELAC2, suggesting a functional link between tumorigenesis and mitochondrial RNA metabolism.

Functional analysis of new variants at the low-density lipoprotein receptor associated with familial hypercholesterolemia.||||||||Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disease of lipid metabolism caused by defects in the genes LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9. The prevalence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) is estimated between 1/200 and 1/250. Early detection of patients with FH allows initiation of treatment, thus reducing the risk of coronary heart disease. In this study, we performed in vitro characterization of new LDLR variants found in our patients. Genetic analysis was performed by Next Generation Sequencing using a customized panel of 198 genes in DNA samples of 516 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of probable or definitive FH. All new LDLR variants found in our patients were functionally validated in CHO-ldlA7 cells. The LDLR activity was measured by flow cytometry and LDLR expression was detected by immunofluorescence. Seven new variants at LDLR were tested: c.518 G>C;p.(Cys173Ser), c.[684 G>T;694 G>T];p.[Glu228Asp;Ala232Ser], c.926C>A;p.(Pro309His), c.1261A>G;p.(Ser421Gly), c.1594T>A;p.(Tyr532Asn), and c.2138delC;p.(Thr713Lysfs*17). We classified all variants as pathogenic except p.(Ser421Gly) and p.(Ala232Ser). The functional in vitro characterization of rare variants at the LDLR is a useful tool to classify the new variants. This approach allows us to confirm the genetic diagnosis of FH, avoiding the classification as "uncertain significant variants", and therefore, carry out cascade family screening.

Mitochondrial single-stranded DNA binding protein novel de novo SSBP1 mutation in a child with single large-scale mtDNA deletion (SLSMD) clinically manifesting as Pearson, Kearns-Sayre, and Leigh syndromes.||||||||Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome integrity is essential for proper mitochondrial respiratory chain function to generate cellular energy. Nuclear genes encode several proteins that function at the mtDNA replication fork, including mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSBP1), which is a tetrameric protein that binds and protects single-stranded mtDNA (ssDNA). Recently, two studies have reported pathogenic variants in SSBP1 associated with hearing loss, optic atrophy, and retinal degeneration. Here, we report a 14-year-old Chinese boy with severe and progressive mitochondrial disease manifestations across the full Pearson, Kearns-Sayre, and Leigh syndromes spectrum, including infantile anemia and bone marrow failure, growth failure, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, severe retinal dystrophy of the rod-cone type, sensorineural hearing loss, chronic kidney disease, multiple endocrine deficiencies, and metabolic strokes. mtDNA genome sequencing identified a single large-scale 5 kilobase mtDNA deletion (m.8629_14068del5440), present at 68% and 16% heteroplasmy in the proband's fibroblast cell line and blood, respectively, suggestive of a mtDNA maintenance defect. On trio whole exome blood sequencing, the proband was found to harbor a novel de novo heterozygous mutation c.79G>A (p.E27K) in SSBP1. Size exclusion chromatography of p.E27K SSBP1 revealed it remains a stable tetramer. However, differential scanning fluorimetry demonstrated p.E27K SSBP1 relative to wild type had modestly decreased thermostability. Functional assays also revealed p.E27K SSBP1 had altered DNA binding. Molecular modeling of SSBP1 tetramers with varying combinations of mutant subunits predicted general changes in surface accessible charges, strength of inter-subunit interactions, and protein dynamics. Overall, the observed changes in protein dynamics and DNA binding behavior suggest that p.E27K SSBP1 can interfere with DNA replication and precipitate the introduction of large-scale mtDNA deletions. Thus, a single large-scale mtDNA deletion (SLSMD) with manifestations across the clinical spectrum of Pearson, Kearns-Sayre, and Leigh syndromes may result from a nuclear gene disorder disrupting mitochondrial DNA replication.

Untargeted adductomics of newborn dried blood spots identifies modifications to human serum albumin associated with childhood leukemia.||||||||The developing fetus is exposed to chemicals, which are metabolized to electrophiles that form adducts with nucleophilic Cys34 of human serum albumin (HSA). By measuring these adducts in neonatal blood spots (NBS), we obtain information regarding fetal exposures during the last month of gestation. To discover potential risk factors for childhood leukemia resulting from in utero exposures, we used untargeted adductomics to measure HSA-Cys34 adducts in 782 archived NBS, collected from incident cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and matched population-based controls. Among a total of 28 Cys34 modifications that were measured, we found no differences in adduct abundances between childhood leukemia cases and controls overall. However, cases of T-cell ALL had higher abundances of adducts of reactive carbonyl species and a Cys34 disulfide of homocysteine was present at lower levels in AML cases. These results suggest that oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation may be etiologic factors of T-cell ALL, and alterations in one-carbon metabolism and epigenetic changes may be predictors of AML. Future replication of the results with larger sample sizes is necessary.

DJ-1 remodels mature α-synuclein fibrils into heterogeneous toxic oligomeric species. The remodeled fibers show loose surface topology due to a decrease in elastic modulus and disrupt membrane architecture, internalize easily and induce aberrant nitric oxide release. Our results provide a mechanism by which partially oxidized DJ-1 counteracts α-synuclein aggregation at initial stages of aggregation and provide evidence of a deleterious effect of remodeled α-synuclein species generated by partially oxidized DJ-1.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms in Orai1 associated with atopic dermatitis inhibit protein turnover, decrease calcium entry and disrupt calcium-dependent gene expression.||||||||Loss-of function mutations in Orai1 Ca2+ channels lead to a form of severe combined immunodeficiency, auto-immunity, muscle hypotonia and defects in dental enamel production and sweat gland function. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Orai1 have been found and localise to the second extracellular loop. These polymorphisms associate with atopic dermatitis but how they affect Ca2+ signalling and cell function is unknown. Here we find that Orai1-SNPs turnover considerably more slowly than wild type Orai1 and are more abundantly expressed in the plasma membrane. We show a central role for flotillin in the endocytotic recycling of Orai1 channels and that endocytosed wild type Orai1 is trafficked to Rab7-positive late endosomes for lysosomal degradation. Orai1-SNPs escape the degradation pathway and instead enter Rab11-positive recycling endosomes, where they are returned to the surface membrane through Arf6-dependent exocytosis. We find that Orai1-SNPs escape late endosomes through endosomal pH regulation of interaction between the channel and flotillin. We identify a pH-sensitive electrostatic interaction between positively charged arginine in extracellular loop 2 (K210) and a negatively charged aspartate (D112) in extracellular loop 1 that helps determine Orai1 turnover. The increase in membrane Orai1-SNP leads to a mis-match in Orai1:STIM stoichiometry, resulting in inhibition of Ca2+ entry and Ca2+-dependent gene expression. Our results identify new strategies for targeting atopic dermatitis.

Identifying the Pathological Domain of Alpha- Synuclein as a Therapeutic for Parkinson's Disease.||||||||Alpha-synuclein is considered the major pathological protein associated with Parkinson's disease, but there is still no effective immunotherapy which targets alpha-synuclein. In order to create a safer and more effective therapy against PD, we are targeting an epitope of alpha-synuclein rather than full-length alpha-synuclein. We have selected several antigenic domains (B-cell epitope) through antigenicity prediction, and also made several recombinant protein fragments from alpha-synuclein upon antigenicity prediction in an E. coli system. We then tested the function of each of the peptides and recombinant fragments in aggregation, their toxicity and antigenicity. We have discovered that the full-length recombinant (aa1-140) can aggregate into oligomers or even fibrils, and fragment aa15-65 can promote the aggregation of aa1-140. It is worth noting that it not only promotes whole protein aggregation, but also self-aggregates as seen by western blotting and silver staining assays. We have tested all candidates on primary neurons for their toxicity and discovered that aa15-65 is the most toxic domain compared to all other fragments. The antibody targeting this domain also showed both anti-aggregation activity and some therapeutic effect. Therefore, we believe that we have identified the most potent therapeutic domain of alpha synuclein as a therapeutic target.

Persistently elevated alpha-fetoprotein associated with chronic hepatitis B during chemotherapy for malignant ovarian germ cell tumors: a case series and a review of the literature.||||||||Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) plays a crucial role in the management of malignant ovarian germ cell tumors (MOGCTs) and is an important reference index for chemotherapy termination. However, a high level of AFP can also be caused by several benign diseases, causing confusion and impacting treatment decisions.||||We described four patients who were diagnosed with MOGCTs; the histologic subtype in two of them was mixed MOGCTs (yolk sac tumor with mature teratoma), while the rest was immature teratoma. The serum AFP level of each patient was abnormal before surgery, but it was still persistently elevated around 300 ng/ml even after additional cycles of chemotherapy. All patients were thoroughly evaluated, but we did not find any evidence of disease progression or residual tumors. Liver function tests were normal, whereas serum assays revealed positive of hepatitis B surface antigen, and two patients had a high level of HBV-DNA. They were chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus and never received relevant treatments. Then they were managed with tumor surveillance and the antiviral treatment. Thereafter, the AFP levels presented a slowly decreasing trend.||||False elevation of AFP in MOGCTs is a rare condition and should be assessed with a comprehensive evaluation to avoid unnecessary treatments.

Phosphorylation of Merlin by Aurora A kinase appears necessary for mitotic progression.||||||||Although Merlin's function as a tumor suppressor and regulator of mitogenic signaling networks such as the Ras/rac, Akt, and Hippo pathways is well-documented, in mammals as well as in insects, its role during cell cycle progression remains unclear. In this study, using a combination of approaches, including FACS analysis, time-lapse imaging, immunofluorescence microscopy, and co-immunoprecipitation, we show that Ser-518 of Merlin is a substrate of the Aurora protein kinase A during mitosis and that its phosphorylation facilitates the phosphorylation of a newly discovered site, Thr-581. We found that the expression in HeLa cells of a Merlin variant that is phosphorylation-defective on both sites leads to a defect in centrosomes and mitotic spindles positioning during metaphase and delays the transition from metaphase to anaphase. We also show that the dual mitotic phosphorylation not only reduces Merlin binding to microtubules but also timely modulates ezrin interaction with the cytoskeleton. Finally, we identify several point mutants of Merlin associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 that display an aberrant phosphorylation profile along with defective α-tubulin-binding properties. Altogether, our findings of an Aurora A-mediated interaction of Merlin with α-tubulin and ezrin suggest a potential role for Merlin in cell cycle progression.

Long noncoding RNA MALAT1 mediates stem cell-like properties in human colorectal cancer cells by regulating miR-20b-5p/Oct4 axis.||||||||Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are crucial components of the tumor microenvironment that take part in tumor initiation, progression, recurrence, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy. This study explores the mechanisms through which CSCs maintain their stemness, especially in tumors of colorectal cancer (CRC), which thus far remain uncertain. Our findings indicated that the expression of miR-20b-5p is negatively correlated with that of metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript-1 (MALAT1, r = -0.928, p = 0.023) and Oct4 (r = -0.894, p = 0.041) in CRC cells. We hypothesized that there may be some targeted regulatory relationships among MALAT1, miR-20b-5p, and Oct4. We proceeded to show that both si-MALAT1 and miR-20b-5p-mimic attenuated microsphere formation and self-renewal capacity, decreased the proportion of CSCs, and downregulated the expression of proteins associated with tumor cell stemness maintenance (Oct4, Nanog, sex-determining region Y-box 2, and Notch1) and cellular metabolism (glucose transporter 1, lactate dehydrogenase B, hexokinase 2, and pyruvate kinase isozyme M2) in HCT-116 cells in vitro. In addition, a xenograft model based on Balb/c mice demonstrated that the administration of either si-MALAT1 or miR-20b-5p-mimic suppressed the tumorigenicity of HCT-116 cells in vivo. The underlying mechanisms may involve the targeting of the tumor cell stemness maintenance-related factor Oct4 by miR-20b-5p. For the first time, we present the possible underlying effects of MALAT1 in influencing the stem cell-like properties of CRC cells. We propose that microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs have vital functions in mediating tumor stemness, which remain to be fully elucidated.b451a2171abe64f9bb17b403d85cdfe1ab250873112e6809b7ad6c8cac5fdbae	Adipose tissue-derived _PROTEIN_ causes _DISEASE_ in obese mice.

Adipose tissue-derived autotaxin causes cardiomyopathy in obese mice.||||||||The prevalence of obesity is dramatic increased and strongly associated with cardiovascular disease. Adipokines, secreted from adipose tissues, are critical risk factors for the development of cardiomyopathy. Present study aimed to investigate the pathophysiological role of autotaxin in obesity-related cardiomyopathy. In high fat diet-fed mice, autotaxin was mainly synthesized and secreted from adipocytes. The increased accumulation of cardiac autotaxin was positively associated with cardiac dysfunction in obese mice. Interestingly, specific blockage of adipose tissue autotaxin effectively protected against high fat diet-induced cardiac structural disorders, left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction. Inhibition of autotaxin further improved high fat diet-induced cardiac fibrosis and mitochondrial dysfunction, including improvement of mitochondrial structure, mass and activities. Our findings demonstrated intervention of adipose tissue biology could influence cardiac modification in obese mice, and adipocyte-derived autotaxin was a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for obesity-related cardiomyopathy.

A heterozygous Ramp2 knockout mouse model was generated for in vivo functional study.||||Using exome sequencing analysis and replication studies, we identified pathogenic variants in receptor activity-modifying protein 2 (RAMP2) within three genetically diverse populations (Han Chinese, German, and Indian). Six heterozygous RAMP2 pathogenic variants (Glu39Asp, Glu54Lys, Phe103Ser, Asn113Lysfs*10, Glu143Lys, and Ser171Arg) were identified among 16 of 4763 POAG patients, whereas no variants were detected in any exon of RAMP2 in 10,953 control individuals. Mutant RAMP2s aggregated in transfected cells and resulted in damage to the AM-RAMP2/CRLR-cAMP signaling pathway. Ablation of one Ramp2 allele led to cAMP reduction and retinal ganglion cell death in mice.||||This study demonstrated that disruption of RAMP2/CRLR-cAMP axis could cause POAG and identified a potential therapeutic intervention for POAG.

Homozygous splice-site mutation c.78 + 5G>A in PMP22 causes congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy.||||||||Congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy (CHN) presents in the neonatal period and results in delayed development of sensory and motor functions due to several gene mutations including in EGR2, MPZ, CNTNAP1, and PMP22. The phenotype of homozygous splice-site mutation in the PMP22 gene has not been described in humans or animal models. Here we describe a family carrying a pathogenic splice-site c.78 + 5G>A mutation in the PMP22 gene. We evaluated the clinical, electrophysiological, histological, and genetic features of the family. The proband with homozygous mutation presented with CHN, while his consanguineous parents with heterozygous mutation were asymptomatic. The proband was a 7-year-old boy. He had motor retardation after birth and had remained unable to walk independently at the time of the study. The compound muscle action potentials and sensory nerve action potentials were not recordable in the boy. The motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities of the parents were slightly to moderately decreased, although they had no symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. The sural nerve biopsy of the boy revealed hypomyelinating neuropathy with absence of large myelinated fibers, no myelin breakdown products, and numerous basal lamina onion bulb formations. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a homozygous splice-site mutation in the PMP22 gene in humans. Our study expands the phenotype and genotype of PMP22-related neuropathy.

[Interleukin-33: Friend or Enemy in the Fight against Tumors?]||||||||Interleukin-33 (IL-33) belongs to the IL-1 cytokine family and acts as a danger signal. IL-33 is released from stressed or necrotic cells. Initially, IL-33 was described as an inducer of the humoral immune response, which activated Th2 cells and mast cells involved in modulating inflammation and allergic reactions. In addition, IL-33 acts as a stimulator of the Th1, NK, and CD8T cells, which induce a cytotoxic immune response against intracellular pathogens. It was recently discovered that this cytokine is involved in the development of cancer by performing both pro- and antitumor functions. IL-33 can directly affect tumor cells and provokes their proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Moreover, IL-33 stimulates carcinogenesis by remodeling the tumor microenvironment and inducing angiogenesis, thus contributing to the generation of immunosuppressive conditions. At the same time, IL-33 causes tumor infiltration with cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes and natural killers, which leads to cytolysis-mediated cancer cell death. This review describes the versatile role of the IL-33/ST2 cascade in the development of experimental and clinical tumors. In addition, we discuss the prospects for the application of IL-33 and ST2 as diagnostic biomarkers and targets for cancer immunotherapy.

Loss of Ataxin-1 Potentiates Alzheimer's Pathogenesis by Elevating Cerebral BACE1 Transcription.||||||||Expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in ATXN1 causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), a neurodegenerative disease that impairs coordination and cognition. While ATXN1 is associated with increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, CAG repeat number in AD patients is not changed. Here, we investigated the consequences of ataxin-1 loss of function and discovered that knockout of Atxn1 reduced CIC-ETV4/5-mediated inhibition of Bace1 transcription, leading to increased BACE1 levels and enhanced amyloidogenic cleavage of APP, selectively in AD-vulnerable brain regions. Elevated BACE1 expression exacerbated Aβ deposition and gliosis in AD mouse models and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and olfactory axonal targeting. In SCA1 mice, polyglutamine-expanded mutant ataxin-1 led to the increase of BACE1 post-transcriptionally, both in cerebrum and cerebellum, and caused axonal-targeting deficit and neurodegeneration in the hippocampal CA2 region. These findings suggest that loss of ataxin-1 elevates BACE1 expression and Aβ pathology, rendering it a potential contributor to AD risk and pathogenesis.

Novel homozygous ENPP1 mutation causes generalized arterial calcifications of infancy, thrombocytopenia, and cardiovascular and central nervous system syndrome.||||||||Generalized arterial calcifications of infancy (GACI) is caused by mutations in ENPP1. Other ENPP1-related phenotypes include pseudoxanthoma elasticum, hypophosphatemic rickets, and Cole disease. We studied four children from two Bedouin consanguineous families who presented with severe clinical phenotype including thrombocytopenia, hypoglycemia, hepatic, and neurologic manifestations. Initial working diagnosis included congenital infection; however, patients remained without a definitive diagnosis despite extensive workup. Consequently, we investigated a potential genetic etiology. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed for affected children and their parents. Following the identification of a novel mutation in the ENPP1 gene, we characterized this novel multisystemic presentation and revised relevant imaging studies. Using WES, we identified a novel homozygous mutation (c.556G > C; p.Gly186Arg) in ENPP1 which affects a highly conserved protein domain (somatomedin B2). ENPP1-associated genetic diseases exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity depending on mutation type and location. Follow-up clinical characterization of these families allowed us to revise and detect new features of systemic calcifications, which established the diagnosis of GACI, expanding the phenotypic spectrum associated with ENPP1 mutations. Our findings demonstrate that this novel ENPP1 founder mutation can cause a fatal multisystemic phenotype, mimicking severe congenital infection. This also represents the first reported mutation affecting the SMB2 domain, associated with GACI.

Since the original discovery that SRY deletions cause sex reversal, mutations in half of the 20 human SOX genes have been associated with rare congenital disorders, henceforward called SOXopathies. Mutations are generally de novo, heterozygous, and inactivating, revealing gene haploinsufficiency, but other types, including duplications, have been reported too. Missense variants primarily target the HMG domain, the SOX hallmark that mediates DNA binding and bending, nuclear trafficking, and protein-protein interactions. We here review key clinical and molecular features of SOXopathies and discuss the prospect that the disease family likely involves more SOX genes and larger clinical and genetic spectrums than currently appreciated.

PMID:31491427	Sodium bicarbonate transporter-like protein 11	PR:000015156	[[0..46]]	disease	MONDO:0000001	[[154..161]]	null	162	Y	Sodium bicarbonate transporter-like protein 11 (SLC4A11) is a transporter present in the corneal endothelium, and its mutation causes corneal endothelial disease.	Homeostasis of SLC4A11 protein is mediated by endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation.||||||||The cornea is an important tissue that refracts light, and the corneal endothelium prevents edema of the corneal stroma by acting as a barrier and a pump for the transport of essential molecules/ions. Sodium bicarbonate transporter-like protein 11 (SLC4A11) is a transporter present in the corneal endothelium, and its mutation causes corneal endothelial disease. Here, we aimed to investigate the degradation pathway of SLC4A11. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that two variants of SLC4A11 transcripts, variant 2 (SLC4A11-B) and variant 3 (SLC4A11-C), were expressed in human corneal endothelial tissues. Transient overexpression of these variants in HEK293T cells revealed that SLC4A11-B abundantly localized to the cell membrane. Furthermore, SLC4A11-B-transfected HEK293T cells expressed the mature glycosylated forms and immature non-glycosylated forms of SLC4A11. Cycloheximide chase experiments revealed that mature SLC4A11 showed high degradation stability; however, degradation of immature SLC4A11-B was significantly faster than that of immature SLC4A11-C. Therefore, we performed further degradation analysis of the SLC4A11 mutants, which are classified into ER-retained and cell surface-associated mutants similar to the wild type. Compared to the wild type, ER-retained mutants S213P and W240P showed delayed degradation but the cell surface-associated mutants showed minimal degradation. Further analysis using proteasome inhibitors revealed that degradation of immature SLC4A11 was delayed after treatment with the proteasome inhibitors, MG-132 and bortezomib, and was mediated by poly-ubiquitination. Moreover, the degradation of immature SLC4A11 protein was suppressed by Eeyarestatin I, an ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) inhibitor. Collectively, these data suggest that SLC4A11 protein is degraded via ERAD.

Inducible Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes Reveal Aberrant Extracellular Regulated Kinase 5 and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase 1/2 Signaling Concomitantly Promote Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in RAF1-Associated Noonan Syndrome.||||||||More than 90% of individuals with Noonan syndrome (NS) with mutations clustered in the CR2 domain of RAF1 present with severe and often lethal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The signaling pathways by which NS RAF1 mutations promote HCM remain elusive, and so far, there is no known treatment for NS-associated HCM.|||| and CRISPR-Cas9-generated isogenic control inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes to model NS RAF1-associated HCM and to further delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease.||||We show that mutant iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes phenocopy the pathology seen in hearts of patients with NS by exhibiting hypertrophy and structural defects. Through pharmacological and genetic targeting, we identify 2 perturbed concomitant pathways that, together, mediate HCM in RAF1 mutant iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Hyperactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2), but not extracellular regulated kinase 1/2, causes myofibrillar disarray, whereas the enlarged cardiomyocyte phenotype is a direct consequence of increased extracellular regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) signaling, a pathway not previously known to be involved in NS. RNA-sequencing reveals genes with abnormal expression in RAF1 mutant iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and identifies subsets of genes dysregulated by aberrant MEK1/2 or ERK5 pathways that could contribute to the NS-associated HCM.||||Taken together, the results of our study identify the molecular mechanisms by which NS RAF1 mutations cause HCM and reveal downstream effectors that could serve as therapeutic targets for treatment of NS and perhaps other, more common, congenital HCM disorders.

Clinical and genetic update of corneal dystrophies.||||||||The International Committee for Classification of Corneal Dystrophies (IC3D) distinguishes between 22 distinct forms of corneal dystrophy which are predominantly autosomal dominant, although autosomal recessive and X-chromosomal dominant patterns do exist. Before any genetic examination, there should be documentation of a detailed corneal exam of as many affected and unaffected family members as possible, because detailed phenotypic description is essential for accurate diagnosis. Corneal documentation should be performed in direct and indirect illumination at the slit lamp with the pharmacologically dilated pupil. For the majority of the corneal dystrophies, a phenotype-genotype correlation has not been demonstrated. However, for the dystrophies associated with mutations in the transforming growth factor, ß-induced gene (TGFBI) a general phenotype-genotype correlation is evident. The discovery of collagen, type XVII, alpha 1 mutation (COL17A1), causative in the called epithelial recurrent erosion dystrophy (ERED) was a very important step in the accurate diagnosis of corneal dystrophies. This led to the subsequent discovery that the entity previously called 10q Thiel-Behnke corneal dystrophy, was in reality actually COL17A1 ERED, and not Thiel-Behnke corneal dystrophy. In addition to the phenotypic landmarks, we describe the current genotype of the individual corneal dystrophies. Differential diagnosis can be aided by information on histopathology, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and confocal microscopy.

A Novel Human Congenital Cataract Mutation in EPHA2 Kinase Domain (p.G668D) Alters Receptor Stability and Function.||||||||To identify the genetic defect in a four-generation Chinese family that causes autosomal dominant congenital posterior subcapsular cataracts, and to understand how this EPHA2 kinase domain mutation affects EPHA2 activity.||||Variants in 54 cataract-associated genes were screened by targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) and then validated by Sanger sequencing. EPHA2 wild-type cDNA was synthesized in vitro, and EPHA2 p.G668D mutant was constructed by PCR site-directed mutagenesis. Western blotting and fluorescence microscopy were used to analyze the expression level of protein and its subcellular localization, respectively. A wound-healing assay was performed to analyze changes to cell migration.||||A novel heterozygous missense mutation was identified in the kinase domain of the EPHA2 gene (c.2003G>A, p.G668D). This is the third congenital cataract mutation being reported in this domain. Functional study revealed that the kinase domain mutation (p.G668D) decreased EphA2 protein level (P = 0.036) via a proteasome-dependent pathway, altered its subcellular localization of the EphA2 from cell-cell contacts to a diffuse perimembranous distribution, and changed the distribution of β-catenin as well. The expression of mutant EphA2 significantly promoted the migration of human lens epithelial cells (P = 0.002).||||Our study presented the evidence for a novel EPHA2 kinase domain mutation that causes congenital posterior subcapsular cataracts. The first functional study on an EPHA2 kinase domain mutation that causes a congenital cataract revealed that the G668D mutation destabilized the receptor, changed its subcellular localization, and altered the activation of EphA2 with its ligand ephrin. The mutant EphA2 resulted in a reduced inhibition of cell migration. As a consequence, the c.G668D mutation promoted cell migration and caused the formation of cataracts.

Impaired D2 receptor-dependent dopaminergic transmission in prefrontal cortex of awake mouse model of Parkinson's disease.||||||||The loss-of-function mutation in PARK7/DJ-1 is one of the most common causes of autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease, and patients carrying PARK7 mutations often exhibit both a progressive movement disorder and emotional impairment, such as anxiety. However, the causes of the emotional symptom accompanying PARK7-associated and other forms of Parkinson's disease remain largely unexplored. Using two-photon microscopic Ca2+ imaging in awake PARK7-/- and PARK7+/+ mice, we found that (i) PARK7-/- neurons in the frontal association cortex showed substantially higher circuit activity recorded as spontaneous somatic Ca2+ signals; (ii) both basal and evoked dopamine release remained intact, as determined by both electrochemical dopamine recordings and high performance liquid chromatography in vivo; (iii) D2 receptor expression was significantly decreased in postsynaptic frontal association cortical neurons, and the hyper-neuronal activity were rescued by D2 receptor intervention using either local pharmacology or viral D2 receptor over-expression; and (iv) PARK7-/- mice showed anxiety-like behaviours that were rescued by either local D2 receptor pharmacology or overexpression. Thus, for first time, we demonstrated a robust D2 receptor-dependent phenotype of individual neurons within the prefrontal cortex circuit in awake parkinsonian mice that linked with anxiety. Our work sheds light on early-onset phenotypes and the mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease by imaging brain circuits in an awake mouse model.

Neuropathy-related mutations alter the membrane binding properties of the human myelin protein P0 cytoplasmic tail.||||||||Schwann cells myelinate selected axons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and contribute to fast saltatory conduction via the formation of compact myelin, in which water is excluded from between tightly adhered lipid bilayers. Peripheral neuropathies, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS), are incurable demyelinating conditions that result in pain, decrease in muscle mass, and functional impairment. Many Schwann cell proteins, which are directly involved in the stability of compact myelin or its development, are subject to mutations linked to these neuropathies. The most abundant PNS myelin protein is protein zero (P0); point mutations in this transmembrane protein cause CMT subtype 1B and DSS. P0 tethers apposing lipid bilayers together through its extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain. Additionally, P0 contains a cytoplasmic tail (P0ct), which is membrane-associated and contributes to the physical properties of the lipid membrane. Six CMT- and DSS-associated missense mutations have been reported in P0ct. We generated recombinant disease mutant variants of P0ct and characterized them using biophysical methods. Compared to wild-type P0ct, some mutants have negligible differences in function and folding, while others highlight functionally important amino acids within P0ct. For example, the D224Y variant of P0ct induced tight membrane multilayer stacking. Our results show a putative molecular basis for the hypermyelinating phenotype observed in patients with this particular mutation and provide overall information on the effects of disease-linked mutations in a flexible, membrane-binding protein segment. Using neutron reflectometry, we additionally show that P0ct embeds deep into a lipid bilayer, explaining the observed effects of P0ct on the physical properties of the membrane.

SSBP1 mutations cause mtDNA depletion underlying a complex optic atrophy disorder.||||||||Inherited optic neuropathies include complex phenotypes, mostly driven by mitochondrial dysfunction. We report an optic atrophy spectrum disorder, including retinal macular dystrophy and kidney insufficiency leading to transplantation, associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion without accumulation of multiple deletions. By whole-exome sequencing, we identified mutations affecting the mitochondrial single-strand binding protein (SSBP1) in 4 families with dominant and 1 with recessive inheritance. We show that SSBP1 mutations in patient-derived fibroblasts variably affect the amount of SSBP1 protein and alter multimer formation, but not the binding to ssDNA. SSBP1 mutations impaired mtDNA, nucleoids, and 7S-DNA amounts as well as mtDNA replication, affecting replisome machinery. The variable mtDNA depletion in cells was reflected in severity of mitochondrial dysfunction, including respiratory efficiency, OXPHOS subunits, and complex amount and assembly. mtDNA depletion and cytochrome c oxidase-negative cells were found ex vivo in biopsies of affected tissues, such as kidney and skeletal muscle. Reduced efficiency of mtDNA replication was also reproduced in vitro, confirming the pathogenic mechanism. Furthermore, ssbp1 suppression in zebrafish induced signs of nephropathy and reduced optic nerve size, the latter phenotype complemented by WT mRNA but not by SSBP1 mutant transcripts. This previously unrecognized disease of mtDNA maintenance implicates SSBP1 mutations as a cause of human pathology.

Non-cerebellar symptoms, including cognitive impairment, were already described in this condition. The aim of this study was to perform a detailed cognitive and psychiatric description of patients with SYNE1 gene mutations. We performed neuropsychological and psychiatric evaluations of six patients with SYNE1 ataxia and compared their performance with 18 normal controls paired for age and education level. SYNE1 ataxia patients present cognitive dysfunction, characterized by impairment in attention and processing speed domains. Otherwise, the psychiatric assessment reported low levels of overall behavioral symptoms with only some minor anxiety-related complaints. Although this is a small sample of patients, these results suggest that SYNE1 ataxia patients may represent a model to investigate effects of cerebellar degeneration in higher hierarchical cognitive functions. For further studies, abstract thinking impairment in schizophrenia may be related to dysfunction in cerebellum pathways.

A global functional analysis of missense mutations reveals two major hotspots in the PALB2 tumor suppressor.||||||||While biallelic mutations in the PALB2 tumor suppressor cause Fanconi anemia subtype FA-N, monoallelic mutations predispose to breast and familial pancreatic cancer. Although hundreds of missense variants in PALB2 have been identified in patients to date, only a few have clear functional and clinical relevance. Herein, we investigate the effects of 44 PALB2 variants of uncertain significance found in breast cancer patients and provide detailed analysis by systematic functional assays. Our comprehensive functional analysis reveals two hotspots for potentially deleterious variations within PALB2, one at each terminus. PALB2 N-terminus variants p.P8L [c.23C>T], p.Y28C [c.83A>G], and p.R37H [c.110G>A] compromised PALB2-mediated homologous recombination. At the C-terminus, PALB2 variants p.L947F [c.2841G>T], p.L947S [c.2840T>C], and most strikingly p.T1030I [c.3089C>T] and p.W1140G [c.3418T>C], stood out with pronounced PARP inhibitor sensitivity and cytoplasmic accumulation in addition to marked defects in recruitment to DNA damage sites, interaction with BRCA2 and homologous recombination. Altogether, our findings show that a combination of functional assays is necessary to assess the impact of germline missense variants on PALB2 function, in order to guide proper classification of their deleteriousness.

Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 28-Phenotypic and Molecular Characterization of a Family with Heterozygous and Compound-Heterozygous Mutations in AFG3L2.||||||||While heterozygous mutations in the AFG3L2 gene have been linked to spinocerebellar ataxia 28 (SCA28), homozygous mutations in the same gene can cause spastic ataxia 5 (SPAX5). AFG3L2 encodes a mitochondrial ATP-dependent metalloprotease. We here report a SCA28 patient with biallelic AFG3L2 variants and his heterozygous mother. The patient and his mother underwent a detailed neurological examination and fibroblast lines were established. The effect of the two missense variants on mitochondria was assessed by form factor analysis and quantification of mitochondrial proteins (TOMM70, complex V). The 39-year-old index patient presented with a slowly progressive cerebellar gait disorder for 19 years, bilateral ptosis, and dysarthria. A cranial MRI showed mild cerebellar atrophy. He carried two compound-heterozygous, rare, missense variants (c.1847A>G [p.Y616C], c.2167G>A [p.V723M]) in AFG3L2, while his mother was heterozygous for the first change that had previously been described in SPAX5. Altered mitochondrial morphology and interconnectivity, together with reduced protein levels of TOMM70 and complex V (ATPase), suggest mitochondrial structural defects in the patient's fibroblasts. No significant abnormalities were found in his mother's fibroblast cultures albeit all measurements were slightly below the control level. We here present a SCA28 patient with compound-heterozygous AFG3L2 variants and demonstrate mitochondrial abnormalities in skin fibroblast cultures from this patient. Thus, AFG3L2 variants should be considered in both slowly progressive ataxias and phenotypes with clinical features reminiscent of mitochondrial disease. Of note, ptosis was present in both mutation carriers and may serve as a red flag in the diagnosis of SCA28.

Ciliary exclusion of Polycystin-2 promotes kidney cystogenesis in an autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease model.||||||||The human PKD2 locus encodes Polycystin-2 (PC2), a TRPP channel that localises to several distinct cellular compartments, including the cilium. PKD2 mutations cause Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) and affect many cellular pathways. Data underlining the importance of ciliary PC2 localisation in preventing PKD are limited because PC2 function is ablated throughout the cell in existing model systems. Here, we dissect the ciliary role of PC2 by analysing mice carrying a non-ciliary localising, yet channel-functional, PC2 mutation. Mutants develop embryonic renal cysts that appear indistinguishable from mice completely lacking PC2. Despite not entering the cilium in mutant cells, mutant PC2 accumulates at the ciliary base, forming a ring pattern consistent with distal appendage localisation. This suggests a two-step model of ciliary entry; PC2 first traffics to the cilium base before TOP domain dependent entry. Our results suggest that PC2 localisation to the cilium is necessary to prevent PKD.

Interaction of the tetratricopeptide repeat domain of aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein-like 1 with the regulatory Pγ subunit of phosphodiesterase 6.||||||||Phosphodiesterase-6 (PDE6) is key to both phototransduction and health of rods and cones. Proper folding of PDE6 relies on the chaperone activity of aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein-like 1 (AIPL1), and mutations in both PDE6 and AIPL1 can cause a severe form of blindness. Although AIPL1 and PDE6 are known to interact via the FK506-binding protein domain of AIPL1, the contribution of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of AIPL1 to its chaperone function is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that AIPL1-TPR interacts specifically with the regulatory Pγ subunit of PDE6. Use of NMR chemical shift perturbation (CSP) mapping technique revealed the interface between the C-terminal portion of Pγ and AIPL1-TPR. Our solution of the crystal structure of the AIPL1-TPR domain provided additional information, which together with the CSP data enabled us to generate a model of this interface. Biochemical analysis of chimeric AIPL1-AIP proteins supported this model and also revealed a correlation between the affinity of AIPL1-TPR for Pγ and the ability of Pγ to potentiate the chaperone activity of AIPL1. Based on these results, we present a model of the larger AIPL1-PDE6 complex. This supports the importance of simultaneous interactions of AIPL1-FK506-binding protein with the prenyl moieties of PDE6 and AIPL1-TPR with the Pγ subunit during the folding and/or assembly of PDE6. This study sheds new light on the versatility of TPR domains in protein folding by describing a novel TPR-protein binding partner, Pγ, and revealing that this subunit imparts AIPL1 selectivity for its client.

Novel presenilin 1 mutation (p.Thr-Pro116-117Ser-Thr) in a Spanish family with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.||||||||Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) is a γ-secretase component, which is in charge of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage. APP is believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PSEN1 mutations are the most important causes of familial AD, being related to the earlier onset and rapid progression of the disease. Presenilins and APP mutations represent an extraordinary opportunity to study the pathophysiology of AD. We describe the clinical and genetic study of a 37-year-old male patient with a novel mutation in PSEN1 (p.Thr-Pro116-117Ser-Thr). We have studied the pedigree of his family with a further 9 members affected, all of them with onset in their 30s. We have also described the clinical data and results of brain biopsies in 2 of them. DNA sequencing of a tissue sample from an uncle of the patient, who died of AD in the 80s, showed the same mutation as in the patient. These data and predictive analysis indicate the pathogenicity of the mutation.

A novel truncating PAX2 mutation in a boy with renal coloboma syndrome with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis causing rapid progression to end-stage kidney disease.||||||||Renal coloboma syndrome (RCS, MIM#120330), also known as papillorenal syndrome, is an inherited autosomal dominant disease characterized by ocular and/or renal involvement due to PAX2 mutation. The renal involvement typically consists of a hypo/dysplatic kidney and/or vesicoureteral reflux. Recent studies reported that missense PAX2 mutations cause familial focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) without renal morphological malformations. To date, the reports of genotype-phenotype correlation including pathological findings regarding PAX2 mutations are scarce. We report a case of RCS with a novel PAX2 mutation that was pathologically diagnosed as FSGS and rapidly progressed to end-stage kidney failure (ESKD) with a review of past literature. A 6-year-old boy, who had bilateral coloboma and loss of vision in the left eye, was noted non-nephrotic proteinuria and renal dysfunction via school urine screening. Abdominal ultrasound showed no renal and urinary tract malformations and kidney biopsy showed FSGS. Genetic analysis revealed a novel insertion-deletion mutation in PAX2 (NM003987.4: c.70_72delinsA; p.Gly24Argfs*29). His kidney function deteriorated gradually during the following 2 years and kidney transplantation was performed at 9 years of age. In previous reports describing PAX2 mutations with FSGS, affected individuals with missense PAX2 mutations developed ESKD in adulthood, whereas one case with truncating PAX2 mutations developed ESKD in childhood similar to the current case. Our case highlighted the association of truncating PAX2 mutations with the risk of rapid progression to ESKD. Thus, PAX2 mutations should be included in genetic screening for such cases even in the absence of renal and urinary tract malformations.

We created a mouse model knocked-in for the Q1970fsX16+A4329D RYR1 mutations, which are isogenic with those identified in a severely affected child with MmD. During the first 20 weeks after birth the body weight and the spontaneous running distance of the mutant mice were 20% and 50% lower compared to wild-type littermates. Skeletal muscles from mutant mice contained 'cores' characterized by severe myofibrillar disorganization associated with misplacement of mitochondria. Furthermore, their muscles developed less force and had smaller electrically evoked calcium transients. Mutant RyR1 channels incorporated into lipid bilayers were less sensitive to calcium and caffeine, but no change in single-channel conductance was observed. Our results demonstrate that the phenotype of the RyR1Q1970fsX16+A4329D compound heterozygous mice recapitulates the clinical picture of multiminicore patients and provide evidence of the molecular mechanisms responsible for skeletal muscle defects.

Novel compound heterozygous PKHD1 mutations cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in a Han Chinese family.||||||||Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a hereditary fibrocystic disease that primarily involves the kidneys and hepatobiliary tract. The polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 (PKHD1) gene is the only gene implicated in ARPKD. The present study aimed to identify PKHD1 mutations causing ARPKD in a Chinese family. A couple that underwent prenatal genetic diagnosis for ARPKD and their families were recruited for the present study. Genomic DNA was collected from the amniotic fluid of the fetus (proband) and from peripheral blood of all other available family members. Targeted exome sequencing was performed on the couple and the proband, followed by direct Sanger sequencing on other family members and normal controls to confirm candidate pathogenic variants. Two novel compound heterozygous mutations in the PKHD1 gene were identified as causative in the proband, including maternally inherited c.2876C>T (p.Ser959Phe) and paternally inherited c.5772C>A (p.Phe1924Leu). Each mutation was found to co‑segregate with the ARPKD phenotype in the family. Other family members either carried one of the two mutations or lacked both mutations, while the mutations were not found in 576 ethnically matched normal controls. Therefore, two novel compound heterozygous PKHD1 mutations were implicated in causing ARPKD in a Han Chinese family. The results expand the mutation spectrum of PKHD1 that leads to ARPKD, which may improve genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis for families with ARPKD.

Novel homozygous ENPP1 mutation causes generalized arterial calcifications of infancy, thrombocytopenia, and cardiovascular and central nervous system syndrome.||||||||Generalized arterial calcifications of infancy (GACI) is caused by mutations in ENPP1. Other ENPP1-related phenotypes include pseudoxanthoma elasticum, hypophosphatemic rickets, and Cole disease. We studied four children from two Bedouin consanguineous families who presented with severe clinical phenotype including thrombocytopenia, hypoglycemia, hepatic, and neurologic manifestations. Initial working diagnosis included congenital infection; however, patients remained without a definitive diagnosis despite extensive workup. Consequently, we investigated a potential genetic etiology. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed for affected children and their parents. Following the identification of a novel mutation in the ENPP1 gene, we characterized this novel multisystemic presentation and revised relevant imaging studies. Using WES, we identified a novel homozygous mutation (c.556G > C; p.Gly186Arg) in ENPP1 which affects a highly conserved protein domain (somatomedin B2). ENPP1-associated genetic diseases exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity depending on mutation type and location. Follow-up clinical characterization of these families allowed us to revise and detect new features of systemic calcifications, which established the diagnosis of GACI, expanding the phenotypic spectrum associated with ENPP1 mutations. Our findings demonstrate that this novel ENPP1 founder mutation can cause a fatal multisystemic phenotype, mimicking severe congenital infection. This also represents the first reported mutation affecting the SMB2 domain, associated with GACI.

NTHL1 biallelic mutations seldom cause colorectal cancer, serrated polyposis or a multi-tumor phenotype, in absence of colorectal adenomas.||||||||The cancer-predisposing syndrome caused by biallelic mutations in NTHL1 may not be a solely colorectal cancer (CRC) and polyposis syndrome but rather a multi-tumor recessive disease. The presence of ≤10 adenomas in several mutation carriers suggests a possible causal role of NTHL1 in hereditary or early-onset nonpolyposis CRC. The involvement of NTHL1 in serrated/hyperplastic polyposis remains unexplored. The aim of our study is to elucidate the role of NTHL1 in the predisposition to personal or familial history of multiple tumor types, familial/early-onset nonpolyposis CRC, and serrated polyposis. NTHL1 mutational screening was performed in 312 cancer patients with personal or family history of multiple tumor types, 488 with hereditary nonpolyposis CRC, and 96 with serrated/hyperplastic polyposis. While no biallelic mutation carriers were identified in patients with personal and/or family history of multiple tumor types or with serrated polyposis, one was identified among the 488 nonpolyposis CRC patients. The carrier of c.268C>T (p.Q90*) and 550-1G>A was diagnosed with CRC and meningioma at ages 37 and 45 respectively, being reclassified as attenuated adenomatous polyposis after the cumulative detection of 26 adenomas. Our findings suggest that biallelic mutations in NTHL1 rarely cause CRC, a personal/familial multi-tumor history, or serrated polyposis, in absence of adenomas.

BBS5 and INPP5E mutations associated with ciliopathy disorders in families from Pakistan.||||||||Ciliopathies are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders often exhibiting phenotypic overlap and caused by abnormalities in the structure or function of cellular cilia. As such, a precise molecular diagnosis is important for guiding clinical management and genetic counseling. In the present study, two Pakistani families comprising individuals with overlapping clinical features suggestive of a ciliopathy syndrome, including intellectual disability, obesity, congenital retinal dystrophy, and hypogonadism (in males), were investigated clinically and genetically. Whole-exome sequencing identified the likely causes of disease as a novel homozygous frameshift mutation (NM_152384.2: c.196delA; p.(Arg66Glufs*12); family 1) in BBS5, and a nonsense mutation (NM_019892.5:c.1879C>T; p.Gln627*; family 2) in INPP5E, previously reported in an extended Pakistani family with MORM syndrome. Our findings expand the molecular spectrum associated with BBS5 mutations in Pakistan and provide further supportive evidence that the INPP5E mutation is a common cause of ciliopathy in Northern Pakistan, likely representing a regional founder mutation. This study also highlights the value of genomic studies in Pakistan for families affected by rare heterogeneous developmental disorders and where clinical phenotyping may be limited by geographical and financial constraints. The identification of the spectrum and frequency of disease-causing variants within this setting enables the development of population-specific genetic testing strategies targeting variants common to the local population and improving health care outcomes.

EPHA2 wild-type cDNA was synthesized in vitro, and EPHA2 p.G668D mutant was constructed by PCR site-directed mutagenesis. Western blotting and fluorescence microscopy were used to analyze the expression level of protein and its subcellular localization, respectively. A wound-healing assay was performed to analyze changes to cell migration.||||A novel heterozygous missense mutation was identified in the kinase domain of the EPHA2 gene (c.2003G>A, p.G668D). This is the third congenital cataract mutation being reported in this domain. Functional study revealed that the kinase domain mutation (p.G668D) decreased EphA2 protein level (P = 0.036) via a proteasome-dependent pathway, altered its subcellular localization of the EphA2 from cell-cell contacts to a diffuse perimembranous distribution, and changed the distribution of β-catenin as well. The expression of mutant EphA2 significantly promoted the migration of human lens epithelial cells (P = 0.002).||||Our study presented the evidence for a novel EPHA2 kinase domain mutation that causes congenital posterior subcapsular cataracts. The first functional study on an EPHA2 kinase domain mutation that causes a congenital cataract revealed that the G668D mutation destabilized the receptor, changed its subcellular localization, and altered the activation of EphA2 with its ligand ephrin. The mutant EphA2 resulted in a reduced inhibition of cell migration. As a consequence, the c.G668D mutation promoted cell migration and caused the formation of cataracts.

Causative and common PHOX2B variants define a broad phenotypic spectrum.||||||||Paired Like homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) is a gene crucial for the differentiation of the neural lineages of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), whose coding mutations cause congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). The vast majority of PHOX2B mutations in CCHS is represented by expansions of a polyalanine region in exon 3, collectively defined PARMs (PolyAlanine Repeat Mutations), the minority being frameshift, missense and nonsense mutations, defined as NPARMs (Non-PARMs). While PARMs are nearly exclusively associated with isolated CCHS, most of NPARMs is detected in syndromic CCHS, presenting with neuroblastoma and/or Hirschsprung disease. More recently, evidence of a complex role of PHOX2B in the pathogenesis of a wider spectrum of ANS disorders has emerged. Indeed, common and hypomorphic PHOX2B variants, including synonymous, polyalanine-contractions, gene deletions may influence the occurrence of either apparent life-threatening event (ALTE), Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), neuroblastoma, or isolated HSCR, likely through small effects on PHOX2B expression levels. After an introduction to the role of PHOX2B in the ANS development, causative mutations, common variants, and gene expression deregulation of the PHOX2B gene are discussed, though the involvement of synonymous variants and contractions requires further confirmations with respect to ANS disorders and molecular mechanisms underlying the PHOX2B phenotypic heterogeneity.

Peripheral myelin protein 2 - a novel cluster of mutations causing Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy.||||||||Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is the most common inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by wide clinical, genetic and pathomechanistic heterogeneity. Recently, the gene encoding peripheral myelin protein 2 (PMP2) was identified as a novel cause for CMT neuropathy with three mutations that structurally cluster together (p.Ile43Asn, p.Thr51Pro, p.Ile52Thr) reported in five families.||||Using whole exome sequencing and cohort screening we identified two novel missense substitutions in PMP2 in Bulgarian (p.Met114Thr, c.341C > T) and German (p.Val115Ala, c.344 T > C) families. The mutations affect adjacent and highly conserved amino acid residues outside of the known mutation-rich region in the protein. Crystal structure analysis positions the affected residues within a cluster of highly conserved fatty acid coordinating residues implying their functional significance. The clinical, electrophysiological and imaging features in both families were consistent with a childhood onset polyneuropathy with variable patterns of demyelination, slow to very slow progression, and most severe involvement of the peroneal muscles.||||We expand the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of PMP2-related peripheral neuropathy. Our findings reveal a second mutational cluster in the protein.

A case report: X-linked dystrophin gene mutation causing severe isolated dilated cardiomyopathy.||||||||X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XLDCM) is a rare but rapidly progressive cardiomyopathy caused by dystrophin gene mutation. Mutations are more often associated with Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy, which are characterized by skeletal muscle weakness or limb girdle dystrophy. However, patients with isolated XLDCM have normal skeletal muscle but complete dystrophin loss in cardiac muscle resulting in isolated myocardial involvement without overt signs of skeletal myopathy.||||A previously well 16-year-old boy developed sudden onset dense left-sided weakness and facial droop. Computed tomography (CT) angiography and CT brain showed an occluded right internal carotid artery extending to the right middle cerebral artery. He underwent successful endovascular clot retrieval but developed frank pulmonary oedema and cardiogenic shock requiring inotropic support and intubation. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated severe left ventricular (LV) cardiomyopathy and an apical thrombus. Subsequent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging confirmed the LV parameters and diffuse late gadolinium enhancement. Despite absence of skeletal manifestations, subsequent genetic testing revealed an X-linked dystrophin gene mutation [c.31+G>T (IVS1G>T)]. He was commenced on empirical heart failure therapy and underwent successful cardiac transplantation.||||X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy is a rare, rapidly progressing cardiomyopathy. Patients show normal skeletal muscle dystrophin but absent expression in cardiac muscle, resulting fibrosis, and atrophy. About 20% of affected young males have significantly reduced survival and thus the diagnosis must be considered in cases of idiopathic cardiomyopathy with CMR and genetic testing key to the diagnosis. Whilst evidence exists for empirical heart failure medications, cardiac transplantation remains the definitive treatment.

MSTO1 mutations cause mtDNA depletion, manifesting as muscular dystrophy with cerebellar involvement.||||||||MSTO1 encodes a cytosolic mitochondrial fusion protein, misato homolog 1 or MSTO1. While the full genotype-phenotype spectrum remains to be explored, pathogenic variants in MSTO1 have recently been reported in a small number of patients presenting with a phenotype of cerebellar ataxia, congenital muscle involvement with histologic findings ranging from myopathic to dystrophic and pigmentary retinopathy. The proposed underlying pathogenic mechanism of MSTO1-related disease is suggestive of impaired mitochondrial fusion secondary to a loss of function of MSTO1. Disorders of mitochondrial fusion and fission have been shown to also lead to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion, linking them to the mtDNA depletion syndromes, a clinically and genetically diverse class of mitochondrial diseases characterized by a reduction of cellular mtDNA content. However, the consequences of pathogenic variants in MSTO1 on mtDNA maintenance remain poorly understood. We present extensive phenotypic and genetic data from 12 independent families, including 15 new patients harbouring a broad array of bi-allelic MSTO1 pathogenic variants, and we provide functional characterization from seven MSTO1-related disease patient fibroblasts. Bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in MSTO1 manifest clinically with a remarkably consistent phenotype of childhood-onset muscular dystrophy, corticospinal tract dysfunction and early-onset non-progressive cerebellar atrophy. MSTO1 protein was not detectable in the cultured fibroblasts of all seven patients evaluated, suggesting that pathogenic variants result in a loss of protein expression and/or affect protein stability. Consistent with impaired mitochondrial fusion, mitochondrial networks in fibroblasts were found to be fragmented. Furthermore, all fibroblasts were found to have depletion of mtDNA ranging from 30 to 70% along with alterations to mtDNA nucleoids. Our data corroborate the role of MSTO1 as a mitochondrial fusion protein and highlight a previously unrecognized link to mtDNA regulation. As impaired mitochondrial fusion is a recognized cause of mtDNA depletion syndromes, this novel link to mtDNA depletion in patient fibroblasts suggests that MSTO1-deficiency should also be considered a mtDNA depletion syndrome. Thus, we provide mechanistic insight into the disease pathogenesis associated with MSTO1 mutations and further define the clinical spectrum and the natural history of MSTO1-related disease.

The only previously known disorder linked to C/EBPε is autosomal recessive neutrophil-specific granule deficiency leading to severely impaired neutrophil function and early mortality.||||The aim of this study was to molecularly characterize the effects of C/EBPε transcription factor Arg219His mutation identified in a Finnish family with previously genetically uncharacterized autoinflammatory and immunodeficiency syndrome.||||Genetic analysis, proteomics, genome-wide transcriptional profiling by means of RNA-sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing, and assessment of the inflammasome function of primary macrophages were performed.||||Studies revealed a novel mechanism of genome-wide gain-of-function that dysregulated transcription of 464 genes. Mechanisms involved dysregulated noncanonical inflammasome activation caused by decreased association with transcriptional repressors, leading to increased chromatin occupancy and considerable changes in transcriptional activity, including increased expression of NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3 protein (NLRP3) and constitutively expressed caspase-5 in macrophages.||||We describe a novel autoinflammatory disease with defective neutrophil function caused by a homozygous Arg219His mutation in the transcription factor C/EBPε. Mutated C/EBPε acts as a regulator of both the inflammasome and interferome, and the Arg219His mutation causes the first human monogenic neomorphic and noncanonical inflammasomopathy/immunodeficiency. The mechanism, including widely dysregulated transcription, is likely not unique for C/EBPε. Similar multiomics approaches should also be used in studying other transcription factor-associated diseases.

Mendelian genes in primary open angle glaucoma.||||||||Mutations in each of three genes, myocilin (MYOC), optineurin (OPTN), and TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1), may cause primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) that is inherited as a Mendelian trait. MYOC mutations cause 3-4% of POAG cases with IOP >21 mmHg, while mutations in OPTN, TBK1, and MYOC each cause ∼1% of POAG with IOP ≤21 mmHg, i.e. normal tension glaucoma. Identification of these disease-causing genes has provided insights into glaucoma pathogenesis. Mutations in MYOC cause a cascade of abnormalities in the trabecular meshwork including intracellular retention of MYOC protein, decreased aqueous outflow, higher intraocular pressure, and glaucoma. Investigation of MYOC mutations demonstrated that abnormal retention of intracellular MYOC and stimulation of endoplasmic reticular (ER) stress may be important steps in the development of MYOC-associated glaucoma. Mutations in OPTN and TBK1 cause a dysregulation of autophagy which may directly cause retinal ganglion cell damage and normal tension glaucoma. Discovery of these Mendelian causes of glaucoma has also provided a new set of potential therapeutic targets that may ultimately lead to novel, gene-directed glaucoma treatments.

Novel compound heterozygous PKHD1 mutations cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in a Han Chinese family.||||||||Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a hereditary fibrocystic disease that primarily involves the kidneys and hepatobiliary tract. The polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 (PKHD1) gene is the only gene implicated in ARPKD. The present study aimed to identify PKHD1 mutations causing ARPKD in a Chinese family. A couple that underwent prenatal genetic diagnosis for ARPKD and their families were recruited for the present study. Genomic DNA was collected from the amniotic fluid of the fetus (proband) and from peripheral blood of all other available family members. Targeted exome sequencing was performed on the couple and the proband, followed by direct Sanger sequencing on other family members and normal controls to confirm candidate pathogenic variants. Two novel compound heterozygous mutations in the PKHD1 gene were identified as causative in the proband, including maternally inherited c.2876C>T (p.Ser959Phe) and paternally inherited c.5772C>A (p.Phe1924Leu). Each mutation was found to co‑segregate with the ARPKD phenotype in the family. Other family members either carried one of the two mutations or lacked both mutations, while the mutations were not found in 576 ethnically matched normal controls. Therefore, two novel compound heterozygous PKHD1 mutations were implicated in causing ARPKD in a Han Chinese family. The results expand the mutation spectrum of PKHD1 that leads to ARPKD, which may improve genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis for families with ARPKD.

Detection of novel mitochondrial mutations in cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (COX1) in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).||||||||Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an Autosomal dominant inherited disorder and a rare form‌ of colorectal cancer (CRC) that is characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of adenomas in the rectum and colon. Mostly, cancers develop after the advent of the polyps. It appears in both sexes evenly, and the occurrence of the disease is in the second decade of life. Mitochondrial genome mutations have been reported with a variety of Tumors, but the precise role of these mutations in the pathogenicity and tumor progression is not exactly clear. Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COX1) is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The present study aims at assessing the occurrence of mtDNA mutations in COX1 gene in FAP patients and attempts to find out the cause and effect relationship between mitochondrial mutations and tumor progression.||||In this study, 56 FAP patients were investigated for the presence of the mutations in mitochondrial COX1 coding gene by PCR and sequencing analysis. All sequences that differed from the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) were classified as missense/ nonsense or silent mutations. Functional genomic studies using Bio-informatics tools were performed on the founded mutations to understand the downstream alterations in structure and function of protein.||||We identified 38 changes in the COX1 gene in patients with FAP symptoms. Most of them were heteroplasmic changes of missense type (25/38). Tree of the changes (G6145A, C6988A, and T7306G) were nonsense mutations and had not been reported in the literature before. Our results of bioinformatics predictions showed that the identified mutations can affect mitochondrial functions, especially if the conservative domain of the protein is concerned.||||Our findings indicate a high frequency of mtDNA mutations in all of the FAP cases compared to matched controls. These data significantly enhance our understanding of how such mutations contribute to cancer pathologies and develop the cancer treatment methods by new diagnostic biomarkers, and new drugs for gene therapy.

Sensitive detection of FGFR1 N546K mosaic mutation in patient with encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis and pilocytic astrocytoma.||||||||Encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis (ECCL) is a rare neurocutaneous disorder, with only about 100 cases reported worldwide. It is characterized by congenital lesions of the eye, skin, and central nervous system. Only recently, potential causative FGFR1 point mutations have been identified in brain tumors and cultured skin biopsies from patients with this condition. Here, we analyzed the molecular status of a patient with ECCL and a coexisting pilocytic astrocytoma with detected FGFR1 N546K mutation. The presence of the alteration in both affected and unaffected tissues has been evaluated using Sanger sequencing and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) technique. The ddPCR analysis showed differential distribution of the alteration in all specimens, including unaffected and untreated samples. Therefore, we confirm that FGFR1 N546K is a plausible causative mutation of ECCL patients and could be associated with a risk of brain tumor development. We also show the usefulness of sensitive ddPCR method for detection of low levels of autosomal mosaic mutation in blood or swabs. We suggest that utilization of this method may improve the diagnostic process, especially when targeted therapies are considered.

A novel CSF-1R mutation in a family with hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids misdiagnosed as hydrocephalus.||||||||Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS) is a rare autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene that often results in cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders, motor dysfunction and seizure. We report familial cases of a novel CSF1R mutation causing HDLS similar to hydrocephalus. The patients initially presented with a gait disturbance and then developed progressive cognitive decline, urinary incontinence, epileptic seizures and became bedridden as the disease progressed. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed striking ventricular enlargement and diffuse brain atrophy with frontotemporal predominance, which was later accompanied by white matter changes. Genetic testing in this family showed a novel c.2552T>C (p.L851P) mutation in exon 19 of the CSF1R gene. However, three gene carriers in the family remained clinically asymptomatic. Because of its heterogeneous clinical phenotypes, HDLS patients are often misdiagnosed with other diseases. This is the first genetically proven HDLS case resembling hydrocephalus, and the clinical symptoms of HDLS may be related to the specific genetic mutation.

CDPX2 skin lesions are characterized by transient severe congenital ichthyosis following the lines of Blaschko, whereas in CHILD syndrome, the lesions show striking lateralization. Here, we report a male CDPX2 patient with postzygotic mosaicism of the EBP gene presenting with lateralized skin lesions with strict midline demarcation as seen in CHILD syndrome (although this diagnosis was ruled out based on analysis of NSDHL), but also partly distributed along Blaschko's lines as seen in CDPX2. The lesions resolved within a few months, but the patient had other abnormalities, including shortening of the limbs, epiphyseal stippling, and forearm asymmetry; he also had problems with respiration and feeding in the first 4 years after birth. Kyphoscoliosis with dysplastic vertebral bodies progressed rapidly and required posterior spinal fusion surgery at 6 years old.

Tumour lineage shapes BRCA-mediated phenotypes.||||||||. However, the phenotypic and therapeutic relevance of mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 remains poorly defined in most cancer types. Here we show that in the 2.7% and 1.8% of patients with advanced-stage cancer and germline pathogenic or somatic loss-of-function alterations in BRCA1/2, respectively, selective pressure for biallelic inactivation, zygosity-dependent phenotype penetrance, and sensitivity to PARP inhibition were observed only in tumour types associated with increased heritable cancer risk in BRCA1/2 carriers (BRCA-associated cancer types). Conversely, among patients with non-BRCA-associated cancer types, most carriers of these BRCA1/2 mutation types had evidence for tumour pathogenesis that was independent of mutant BRCA1/2. Overall, mutant BRCA is an indispensable founding event for some tumours, but in a considerable proportion of other cancers, it appears to be biologically neutral-a difference predominantly conditioned by tumour lineage-with implications for disease pathogenesis, screening, design of clinical trials and therapeutic decision-making.

Antisense oligonucleotide treatment ameliorates IFN-γ-induced proteinuria in APOL1-transgenic mice.||||||||African Americans develop end-stage renal disease at a higher rate compared with European Americans due to 2 polymorphisms (G1 and G2 risk variants) in the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene common in people of African ancestry. Although this compelling genetic evidence provides an exciting opportunity for personalized medicine in chronic kidney disease, drug discovery efforts have been greatly hindered by the fact that APOL1 expression is lacking in rodents. Here, we describe a potentially novel physiologically relevant genomic mouse model of APOL1-associated renal disease that expresses human APOL1 from the endogenous human promoter, resulting in expression in similar tissues and at similar relative levels as humans. While naive APOL1-transgenic mice did not exhibit a renal disease phenotype, administration of IFN-γ was sufficient to robustly induce proteinuria only in APOL1 G1 mice, despite inducing kidney APOL1 expression in both G0 and G1 mice, serving as a clinically relevant "second hit." Treatment of APOL1 G1 mice with IONIS-APOL1Rx, an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting APOL1 mRNA, prior to IFN-γ challenge robustly and dose-dependently inhibited kidney and liver APOL1 expression and protected against IFN-γ-induced proteinuria, indicating that the disease-relevant cell types are sensitive to ASO treatment. Therefore, IONIS-APOL1Rx may be an effective therapeutic for APOL1 nephropathies and warrants further development.

Expanding the spectrum of dicer1-associated sarcomas.||||||||DICER1 syndrome is a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome caused by deleterious germline DICER1 mutations. Characteristic "hotspot" somatic mutations of DICER1 have been identified in DICER1-associated tumors. With the exception of genitourinary embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and anaplastic sarcoma of the kidney, sarcomas are rarely reported in DICER1 syndrome. Herein, we report the clinical, histopathologic, and molecular findings of a germline DICER1-associated ovarian sarcoma in a 5-year-old female, a somatic DICER1-associated metastatic peritoneal sarcoma in a 16-year-old female, and a somatic DICER1-associated primary intracranial sarcoma in a 4-year-old male. A comprehensive review of the literature, including 83 DICER1-associated sarcomas, illustrates an unequivocal histologic pattern mimicking pleuropulmonary blastoma, regardless of the site of origin. The features include undifferentiated small round blue cells, poorly differentiated spindle cells, and large bizarre pleomorphic cells (anaplasia), often with rhabdomyoblastic and/or chondroid differentiation, and rare bone/osteoid formation. This unique heterogeneous histologic pattern should raise suspicion for pathogenic DICER1 mutation(s) warranting a detailed review of the family history and DICER1 mutation analysis. In addition to expanding the phenotypic spectrum of DICER1-associated conditions, identification of pathogenic DICER1 variants facilitates optimized genetic counseling, caregiver education and judicious imaging-based surveillance.

Cellular responses of BRCA1-defective HCC1937 breast cancer cells induced by the antimetastasis ruthenium(II) arene compound RAPTA-T.|||||||| (PTA = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane), termed RAPTA-T, exerts promising antimetastatic properties. In this study, the effects of RAPTA-T on BRCA1-defective HCC1937 breast cancer cells have been investigated, and compared to its effects on BRCA1-competent MCF-7 breast cancer cells. RAPTA-T showed a very low cytotoxicity against both tested cells. Ruthenium is found mostly in the cytoplasmic compartment of both cells. Flow cytometric analysis reveals that the compound arrests the growth of both cells by triggering the G2/M phase that led to the induction of apoptosis. At equimolar concentrations, RAPTA-T causes much more cellular BRCA1 damage in HCC1937 than in MCF-7 cells, suppressing the expression of BRCA1 mRNA in both cell lines with the subsequent down-regulation of the BRCA1 protein. Interestingly, RAPTA-T exhibits an approximately fivefold greater ability to suppress the expression of the BRCA1 protein in HCC1937 than in MCF-7 cells. These data provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which RAPTA-T exerts its effects on BRCA1-associated breast cancer cells.

Declining detection rates for APC and biallelic MUTYH variants in polyposis patients, implications for DNA testing policy.||||||||This study aimed to determine the prevalence of APC-associated familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) in a large cohort, taking into account factors as adenoma count and year of diagnosis. All application forms used to send patients in for APC and MUTYH variant analysis between 1992 and 2017 were collected (n = 2082). Using the data provided on the application form, the APC and biallelic MUTYH prevalence was determined and possible predictive factors were examined using multivariate multinomial logistic regression analysis in SPSS. The prevalence of disease causing variants in the APC gene significantly increases with adenoma count while MAP shows a peak prevalence in individuals with 50-99 adenomas. Logistic regression analysis shows significant odds ratios for adenoma count, age at diagnosis, and, interestingly, a decline in the chance of finding a variant in either gene over time. Moreover, in 22% (43/200) of patients with FAP-related extracolonic manifestations a variant was identified. The overall detection rates are above 10% for patients with >10 adenomas aged <60 and >20 adenomas aged <70. Patients with variants outside these criteria had FAP-related extracolonic manifestations, colorectal cancer aged <40, somatic KRAS c.34G > T variant in the tumor or a first-degree relative with >10 adenomas. Therefore, APC and MUTYH testing in patients with >10 adenomas aged <60 and with >20 adenomas aged <70 is advised. Almost all FAP and MAP patients not meeting these criteria showed other characteristics that can be used as an indication to prompt genetic testing.

This syndrome can affect all age groups, with 17% of patients developing MEN1-associated tumors before 21 years of age. Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of MEN1-associated tumors, patients with MEN1 continue to have decreased life expectancy primarily due to malignant neuroendocrine tumors. The most recent clinical practice guidelines for MEN1, published in 2012, highlight the need for early genetic and clinical diagnosis of MEN1 and recommend an intensive surveillance approach for both patients with this syndrome and asymptomatic carriers starting at the age of 5 years with the goal of timely detection and management of MEN1-associated neoplasms and ultimately decreased disease-specific morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, there is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation and individual mutation-dependent surveillance is not possible currently.

Presacral malignant teratoid neoplasm in association with pathogenic DICER1 variation.||||||||We report two malignant sacrococcygeal tumors in infants that were associated with pathogenic DICER1 variation. These tumors were composed of primitive neuroepithelium, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, and cartilage and initially diagnosed as immature teratomas. One child developed intracranial metastasis and died. The second child underwent surgery and chemotherapy and achieved complete remission. This child subsequently developed five additional DICER1-associated neoplasms by age nine. Genetic analysis revealed that both tumors harbored biallelic pathogenic DICER1 variation. We believe these cases represent another novel subtype of DICER1-associated tumor. This new entity, which we propose to call DICER1-associated presacral malignant teratoid neoplasm, may be difficult initially to distinguish from immature teratoma, but recognizing it as an entity can prompt appropriate classification as an aggressive malignancy and facilitate appropriate genetic counseling, DICER1 germline variant testing, screening, and education.

Cardiovascular manifestations of sickle cell disease.||||||||Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most frequent genetic haemoglobinopathy worldwide. Early childhood mortality has dramatically decreased in high-income countries, and most patients now survive beyond the 5th decade. However, in the aging SCD population, the morbidity related to chronic organ damage, especially kidney and heart, has become a major concern. While pulmonary hypertension has attracted most attention, it appears that this condition is frequently linked to left heart failure (HF). Accordingly, SCD-associated cardiomyopathy is emerging as a major cause of reduced quality of life and early mortality in these patients. The diagnosis of this particular phenotype of high-output HF is challenging. Exercise intolerance and dyspnoea in SCD patients are linked to multiple causes including chronic anaemia. Moreover, echocardiographic features are unusual and can be misinterpreted. The classical diagnosis algorithm for HF is generally not suitable in SCD patients, and HF is poorly recognized and mostly diagnosed at a late congestive stage in routine practice. Such patients need to be identified at an earlier stage of myocardial dysfunction via improved phenotyping. This constitutes the first step towards further investigations in SCD needed to improve the prognosis and the quality of life. This article provides an updated review of the recent advances in the pathophysiology and diagnosis, and in addition, perspectives of new therapeutic approaches in SCD-related cardiac manifestations.

The molecular architecture of photoreceptor phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6) with activated G protein elucidates the mechanism of visual excitation.||||||||Photoreceptor phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6) is the central effector of the visual excitation pathway in both rod and cone photoreceptors, and PDE6 mutations that alter PDE6 structure or regulation can result in several human retinal diseases. The rod PDE6 holoenzyme consists of two catalytic subunits (Pαβ) whose activity is suppressed in the dark by binding of two inhibitory γ-subunits (Pγ). Upon photoactivation of rhodopsin, the heterotrimeric G protein (transducin) is activated, resulting in binding of the activated transducin α-subunit (Gtα) to PDE6, displacement of Pγ from the PDE6 active site, and enzyme activation. Although the biochemistry of this pathway is understood, a lack of detailed structural information about the PDE6 activation mechanism hampers efforts to develop therapeutic interventions for managing PDE6-associated retinal diseases. To address this gap, here we used a cross-linking MS-based approach to create a model of the entire interaction surface of Pγ with the regulatory and catalytic domains of Pαβ in its nonactivated state. Following reconstitution of PDE6 and activated Gtα with liposomes and identification of cross-links between Gtα and PDE6 subunits, we determined that the PDE6-Gtα protein complex consists of two Gtα binding sites per holoenzyme. Each Gtα interacts with the catalytic domains of both catalytic subunits and induces major changes in the interaction sites of the Pγ subunit with the catalytic subunits. These results provide the first structural model for the activated state of the transducin-PDE6 complex during visual excitation, enhancing our understanding of the molecular etiology of inherited retinal diseases.

Orolingual Angioedema After Tissue Plasminogen Activator Administration in Patients Taking Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors.||||||||Orolingual angioedema is a rare adverse effect (1%-5%) of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that can lead to significant morbidity in patients with acute ischemic stroke. It is thought that increased levels of bradykinin and histamine resulting from tPA administration can result in angioedema. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can also lead to increased levels of bradykinin and appear to be a risk factor for tPA-associated angioedema. A literature review was conducted to examine previous cases of orolingual angioedema associated with tPA administration in patients also taking ACE inhibitors to better understand the relationship between ACE inhibitors and tPA-induced angioedema. Over a 20-year period, 27 patients who experienced angioedema with tPA while on ACE inhibitor therapy were identified. In this patient population, the onset of angioedema symptoms appeared as soon as 15 min after the tPA bolus and as late as 2 hr after the tPA infusion. Most patients required a combination of supportive medications such as corticosteroids (81.5%), antihistamines (74%), and epinephrine (18.5%) for the management of angioedema. Severe presentations of orolingual angioedema resulted in intubation for airway protection (26%). Symptom resolution ranged from shortly after the administration of supportive medications to 72 hr after symptom onset. Orolingual angioedema after tPA administration has the potential to cause significant morbidity, indicating patients should be monitored closely for a few hours after administration for the development of airway compromise. ACE inhibitors should not be the preferred antihypertensive agents for patients who require blood pressure lowering prior to tPA administration.

Collapsing glomerulopathy has also been described in patients receiving exogenous IFN therapy administered for various medical conditions.

Using breast cancer cell line MCF-7 it was demonstrated in in vitro experiments that the estrogen 17β-estradiol (E2), phytoestrogens (genistein and apigenin) and antiestrogens (tamoxifen and fulvestrant) inhibited estrogen receptor (ERα) expression while only genistein influenced BRCA1 increasing its expression. In hypoxia, that is an important factor of solid tumors progression, the decrease of BRCA1 and ERα expression was demonstrated in MCF-7 cells. Therefore, hypoxia influences both BRCA1-dependent DNA repair and hormonal regulation of breast cancer cell growth. Taken together, obtained results demonstrate a relationship between BRCA1 and steroid hormones signal transduction pathways in breast cancer cells and point out to the importance of complex BRCA1 and ERa expression regulation mechanisms studies including epigenetic gene expression regulation.

In-hospital Outcomes and Characteristics of Heart Failure in Sickle Cell Disease.||||||||Sickle cell disease (SCD) predominantly affects African-Americans (AAs) in the United States (US). Due to increasing life expectancy in developed countries, SCD-associated cardiomyopathy is typically seen in adults. The aim of this study was to distinguish hospitalization for this phenotype from traditional heart failure (HF) in AAs. We used the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database to identify HF hospitalizations in AAs between 2005 and 2014 and stratified them according to SCD status. We compared the characteristics and outcomes before and after matching in a 1:3 ratio for age, gender, insurance, smoking status and admission year. Amongst the 1,195,718 HF admissions in AAs, SCD accounted for 7835. The age (mean ± SD) in the SCD cohort was significantly younger (45.66 ± 13.2) vs non-SCD (64.8 ± 15.2), p<0.001. SCD adults had significantly higher rates of pulmonary hypertension (PH), deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism while non-SCD adults had higher rates of cardiogenic shock and respiratory failure requiring intubation. The national hospitalization rate for HF in AAs increased from 151 to 257 per million between 2005 and 2011 before declining to 241 per million in 2014. There was a decrease in in-hospital mortality in AAs from 4.8% in 2005 to 3.6% in 2014. We also identified independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in SCD with HF. In conclusion, we described hospitalizations for an emerging heart failure phenotype in AAs. Although there is a national decreasing rate of HF hospitalizations in the US, this may not be reflective of the AA population.

Inflammasomes in the pathophysiology of autoinflammatory syndromes.||||||||Inflammasomes are a specialized group of intracellular sensors that are key components of the host innate immune system. Autoinflammatory diseases are disorders of the innate immune system that are characterized by recurrent inflammation and serious complications. Dysregulation of the inflammasome is associated with the onset and progression of several autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndrome, familial Mediterranean fever, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. In this review, we discuss the involvement of various inflammasome components in the regulation of autoinflammatory disorders and describe the manifestations of these autoinflammatory diseases caused by inflammasome activation.

FLAD1-associated multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency identified by newborn screening.||||||||Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), also known as glutaric aciduria type II, is a mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorder caused by variants in ETFA, ETFB, and ETFDH. Recently, riboflavin transporter genes and the mitochondrial FAD transporter gene have also been associated with MADD-like phenotype.||||We present a case of MADD identified by newborn biochemical screening in a full-term infant suggestive of both medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency and MADD. Urine organic acid GC/MS analysis was also concerning for both disorders. However, panel sequencing of ETFA, ETFB, ETFDH, and ACADM was unrevealing. Ultimately, a variant in the FAD synthase gene, FLAD1 was found explaining the clinical presentation.||||Exome sequencing identified compound heterozygous variants in FLAD1: NM_025207.4: c.[442C>T];[1588C>T], p.[Arg148*];[Arg530Cys]. The protein damaging effects were confirmed by Western blot. The patient remained asymptomatic and there was no clinical decompensation during the first year of life. Plasma acylcarnitine and urinary organic acid analyses normalized without any treatment. Riboflavin supplementation was started at 15 months.||||Newborn screening, designed to screen for specific treatable congenital metabolic diseases, may also lead to the diagnosis of additional, very rare metabolic disorders such as FLAD1 deficiency. The case further illustrates that even milder forms of FLAD1 deficiency are detectable in the asymptomatic state by newborn screening.

Gastrodin ameliorates microvascular reperfusion injury-induced pyroptosis by regulating the NLRP3/caspase-1 pathway.||||||||Inflammation is a pivotal feature of myocardial reperfusion-induced microvascular injury and dysfunction. However, the molecular mechanisms by which myocardial reperfusion triggered inflammation remain incurable. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a key intracellular sensor that detection of cellular stress to activation of caspase-1, and consequent IL-1β maturation and pyroptotic cell death. Here, we showed that NLRP3 inflammasome played a key role in myocardial reperfusion-induced microvascular injury. We observed NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in both cardiac microvascular endothelial cells and myocardial I/R animal model. Gastrodin, an effective monomeric component extracted from the herb Gastrodia elata BIume, blocked cardiac microvascular endothelial cell pyroptosis via inhibiting NLRP3/caspase-1 pathway. Gastrodin also reduced interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, gastrodin treatment attenuated infarct size and inflammatory cells infiltration and increased capillary formation. Gastrodin is thus a potential therapeutic for NLRP3-associated inflammatory disease.

Gender differences in prevalence of LRRK2-associated Parkinson disease: A meta-analysis of observational studies.||||||||The gender effect in the prevalence of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) associated Parkinson disease (PD) remains controversial. Herein, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the gender effect among these patients.||||PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched to identify the potential related studies published before December 2017. Case-control studies with separated data of sex and mutation status were included in further analyses. We pooled relative risk (RR) using fixed-effect model. The publication bias and sensitivity analyses were also performed.||||Sixty-four studies with 32452 patients diagnosed with PD were included. Higher prevalence of female patients with LRRK2-associated PD was observed with a pooled RR of 1.22 (95% CI 1.14-1.30, P＜0.001). Further subgroup analyses showed that higher prevalence of female patients was only obtained in G2019S mutation patients (RR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.23-1.43, P＜0.001), but not in G2385R variant patients (RR = 1.03, 95% CI 0.91-1.17, P = 0.651). No significant heterogeneity and publication bias were observed in additional analyses.||||Higher female prevalence of LRRK2 mutation suggests roles of gender-related risk factors in PD patients, especially who carried G2019S mutation. Contrary to idiopathic PD, no sex difference was observed in prevalence of patients carried G2385R variant.

Generation and characterization of six human induced pluripotent stem cell lines (iPSC) from three families with AP4B1-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG47).||||||||Bi-allelic variants in the subunits of the adaptor protein complex 4 lead to childhood-onset, complex hereditary spastic paraplegia (AP-4-HSP): SPG47 (AP4B1), SPG50 (AP4M1), SPG51 (AP4E1), and SPG52 (AP4S1). Here, we describe the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from three AP-4-HSP patients with compound-heterozygous, loss-of-function variants in AP4B1 and sex-matched parents. Fibroblasts were reprogrammed using non-integrating Sendai virus. iPSCs were characterized according to standard protocols including karyotyping, embryoid body formation, pluripotency marker expression and STR profiling. These first iPSC lines for SPG47 provide a valuable resource for studying this rare disease and related forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia.

Genetic and clinical characterization of BRCA-associated hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in Navarra (Spain).||||||||Genetic testing for BRCA1/2 genes is widely used as a strategy to reduce incidence and morbidity of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). The purpose of this study is to analyse the demographic and molecular characteristics of BRCA germline mutations in Navarra, Spain, and to investigate the clinical profile of hereditary and sporadic breast cancer (BC) and ovarian cancer (OC) in the Community.||||The study includes 1246 individuals assessed for BRCA1/2 genetic testing in Navarra, during 2000-2016, and a cohort of BC (n = 4384) and OC (n = 561) from the population-based Navarra Cancer Registry. Distribution and molecular characteristics of BRCA1/2 mutations, as well as, comparative analysis of the clinical course, pathologic features and overall survival (OS) of patients in different risk groups were investigated.||||BRCA mutation detection rate was 16%, with higher proportion (63%) of BRCA2 families. Nineteen per cent of mutations were recurrent, one of which, BRCA2 c.6024dupG, showed high association to OC. BRCA carriers had double risk (95% CI = 1.04-4.33) of developing multiple malignancies than low risk families and were diagnosed at a much earlier age (16.6 and 11.7 years difference for BC and OC, respectively) when compared to the general population. For BC, BRCA carriers showed a more advanced histological stage, higher risk of bilateral neoplasms (OR = 4.3; 95% CI = 1.3-11.4, for BRCA2 carriers) and worse OS rate at 5-, 10- and 15- years, than women with sporadic tumors. For OC, over 70% of patients of all risk groups showed advanced stages at diagnosis, with the highest among BRCA1 carriers (91%). Furthermore, they also had higher probability of developing ovarian bilateral tumors (OR = 7.8, 95% CI = 1.7-55.7, for BRCA1 carriers) than the general population. Five-year OS rate was worse among women with sporadic OC than BRCA carriers, but it levelled out over the 15-year period.||||In addition to national similarities in the HBOC-BRCA1/2 associated mutational spectrum, we identified a recurrent BRCA2 pathogenic variant (c.6024dupG), highly associated to OC in Navarra. Carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations showed a more severe BC and OC phenotype and had a worse overall prognosis when compared to a large cohort of women with sporadic counterpart tumors.

EFTUD2 gene deficiency disrupts osteoblast maturation and inhibits chondrocyte differentiation via activation of the p53 signaling pathway.||||||||Mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly (MFDM) is characteristic of multiple skeletal anomalies comprising craniofacial anomalies/dysplasia, microcephaly, dysplastic ears, choanal atresia, and short stature. Heterozygous loss of function variants of EFTUD2 was previously reported in MFDM; however, the mechanism underlying EFTUD2-associated skeletal dysplasia remains unclear.||||We identified a novel frameshift variant of EFTUD2 (c.1030_1031delTG, p.Trp344fs*2) in an MFDM Chinese patient with craniofacial dysmorphism including ear canal structures and microcephaly, mild intellectual disability, and developmental delay. We generated a zebrafish model of eftud2 deficiency, and a consistent phenotype consisting of mandibular bone dysplasia and otolith loss was observed. We also showed that EFTUD2 deficiency significantly inhibited proliferation, differentiation, and maturation in human calvarial osteoblast (HCO) and human articular chondrocyte (HC-a) cells. RNA-Seq analysis uncovered activated TP53 signaling with increased phosphorylation of the TP53 protein and upregulation of five TP53 downstream target genes (FAS, STEAP3, CASP3, P21, and SESN1) both in HCO and in eftud2-/- zebrafish. Additionally, inhibition of p53 by morpholino significantly reduced the mortality of eftud2-/- larvae.||||Our results confirm a novel de novo variant of the EFTUD2 gene and suggest that EFTUD2 may participate in the maturation and differentiation of osteoblasts and chondrocytes, possibly via activation of the TP53 signaling pathway. Thus, mutations in this gene may lead to skeletal anomalies in vertebrates.

Low-frequency mosaicism in cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndrome: mosaicism in systemic autoinflammatory diseases.||||||||Autoinflammatory disease is an 'inborn error of immunity', resulting in systemic inflammation. Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) is a prototypical autoinflammatory disease caused by gain-of-function mutations in the NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3) gene; these mutations activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in overproduction of IL-1β. The first case of CAPS caused by somatic NLRP3 mosaicism was reported in 2005 after identification of variant small peaks by Sanger sequencing. An international collaborative study revealed that the majority of mutation-negative CAPS cases are due to low-level NLRP3 mosaicism, suggesting that central nervous system involvement in somatic mosaicism patients is milder than in genotype-matched heterozygous patients. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing have expanded the number of NLRP3 somatic mosaicism cases and identified a new entity called 'late-onset CAPS with myeloid-specific NLRP3 mosaicism'; however, no mosaic-specific clinical features have been identified/confirmed yet. With respect to NLRP3 mosaicism in CAPS, a prospective longitudinal study on the variant genotype, its allele frequency and its tissue distribution (along with a comprehensive clinical phenotype) would provide better understanding of NLRP3 mosaicism, resulting in more appropriate patient care and genetic counseling.

Molecular profiles of BRCA1-associated ovarian cancer treated by platinum-based therapy: Analysis of primary, residual and relapsed tumors.||||||||Our study aimed to analyze the evolution of molecular portraits of BRCA1-driven ovarian cancer (OC) during treatment. BRCA1 loss-of-heterozygosity status (LOH) and exome profiles were investigated in serial OC samples from 13 patients, which included primary tumors (n = 11) obtained before neoadjuvant therapy (NACT) or at primary debulking surgery, residual post-NACT cancer tissues (n = 13) and tumor relapses (16 samples from 13 patients). Loss of the wild-type BRCA1 allele was detected in 11/11 (100%) primary tumors, 6/13 (46%) residual post-NACT OC samples and 15/16 (94%) OC relapses. Full tumor triplets were available for four patients undergoing NACT; whereas primary carcinomas from these patients demonstrated BRCA1 LOH, the retention of the wild-type allele was detected in all four post-NACT residual tumors. These four women provided to the study 5 recurrent OC samples; 4 out of 5 tumor relapses had BRCA1 LOH thus resembling BRCA1 status observed in primary but not residual OC tissues. TP53 mutation was detected in 12 out of 13 patients and was retained across all serial samples. OC relapses tended to acquire additional intragenic mutations in genes involved in cell migration, adhesion and cell junction assembly. BRCA1-driven OCs demonstrate the plasticity of BRCA1 status during the treatment course. NACT results in rapid selection of pre-existing BRCA1-proficient cells. However, BRCA1 proficiency appears to be disadvantageous in the absence of platinum exposure, as tumor relapses usually re-acquire BRCA1 LOH during therapy holidays.

By comparing mutation-positive and mutation-negative patients, we aimed to identify phenotype features predictive for a positive genetic test and to evaluate the role of MEN1 mutations in phenotype modulation.||||Mutation screeening of MEN1 gene by Sanger sequencing and assessment of clinical data of 189 consecutively enrolled probands and relatives were performed at our national and European Reference Center. Multiple ligation probe amplification analysis of MEN1 gene and Sanger sequencing of CDKN1B were carried out in clinically suspicious but MEN1-negative cases.||||Twenty-seven probands and twenty family members carried MEN1 mutations. Five mutations have not been described earlier. Pronouncedly high number of phenocopies (>70%) was observed. Clinical suspicion of MEN1 syndrome emerged at significantly earlier age in MEN1-positive compared to MEN1-negative probands. Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors developed significantly earlier and more frequently in carriers compared to non-carriers. Probands with high-impact (frameshift, nonsense, large deletions) mutations, predicted to affect menin function significantly, developed GEP-NETs more frequently compared to low-impact (inframe and missense) mutation carriers.||||MEN1 phenocopy is common and represents a significant confounder for the genetic testing. GEP-NET under 30 years best predicted a MEN1 mutation. The present study thus confirmed a previous proposal and suggested that GEP-NET under 30 years should be considered as a part of the indication criteria for MEN1 mutational analysis.

PLK4 deubiquitination by Spata2-CYLD suppresses NEK7-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation at the centrosome.||||||||The innate immune sensor NLRP3 assembles an inflammasome complex with NEK7 and ASC to activate caspase-1 and drive the maturation of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. NLRP3 inflammasome activity must be tightly controlled, as its over-activation is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Here, we show that NLRP3 inflammasome activation is suppressed by a centrosomal protein Spata2. Spata2 deficiency enhances NLRP3 inflammasome activity both in the macrophages and in an animal model of peritonitis. Mechanistically, Spata2 recruits the deubiquitinase CYLD to the centrosome for deubiquitination of polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4), the master regulator of centrosome duplication. Deubiquitination of PLK4 facilitates its binding to and phosphorylation of NEK7 at Ser204. NEK7 phosphorylation in turn attenuates NEK7 and NLRP3 interaction, which is required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Pharmacological or shRNA-mediated inhibition of PLK4, or mutation of the NEK7 Ser204 phosphorylation site, augments NEK7 interaction with NLRP3 and causes increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our study unravels a novel centrosomal regulatory pathway of inflammasome activation and may provide new therapeutic targets for the treatment of NLRP3-associated inflammatory diseases.

Computational Simulations Identified Two Candidate Inhibitors of Cdk5/p25 to Abrogate Tau-associated Neurological Disorders.||||||||Deregulation of Cdk5 is a hallmark in neurodegenerative diseases and its complex with p25 forms Cdk5/p25, thereby causes severe neuropathological insults. Cdk5/p25 abnormally phosphorylates tau protein, and induces tau-associated neurofibrillary tangles in neurological disorders. Therefore, the pharmacological inhibition of Cdk5/p25 alleviates tau-associated neurological disorders. Herein, computational simulations probed two candidate inhibitors of Cdk5/p25. Structure-based pharmacophore investigated the essential complementary chemical features of ATP-binding site of Cdk5 in complex with roscovitine. Resultant pharmacophore harbored polar interactions with Cys83 and Asp86 residues and non-polar interactions with Ile10, Phe80, and Lys133 residues of Cdk5. The chemical space of selected pharmacophore was comprised of two hydrogen bond donors, one hydrogen bond acceptor, and three hydrophobic features. Decoy test validation of pharmacophore obtained highest Guner-Henry score (0.88) and enrichment factor score (7.23). The screening of natural product drug-like databases by validated pharmacophore retrieved 1126 compounds as candidate inhibitors of Cdk5/p25. The docking of candidate inhibitors filtered 10 molecules with docking score >80.00 and established polar and non-polar interactions with the ATP-binding site residues of Cdk5/p25. Finally, molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy analyses identified two candidate inhibitors of Cdk5/p25. During 30 ns simulation, the candidate inhibitors established <3.0 Å root mean square deviation and stable hydrogen bond interactions with the ATP-binding site residues of Cdk5/p25. The final candidate inhibitors obtained lowest binding free energies of -122.18 kJ/mol and - 117.26 kJ/mol with Cdk5/p25. Overall, we recommend two natural product candidate inhibitors to target the pharmacological inhibition of Cdk5/p25 in tau-associated neurological disorders.

Patterns of recurrence and metastasis in BRCA1/BRCA2-associated breast cancers.||||||||Breast cancer subtypes are associated with distinct metastatic patterns. Whether germline BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation status is independently associated with central nervous system (CNS) relapse, controlling for tumor subtype, is unknown.||||Patients who were treated at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and diagnosed with a first locoregional recurrence (LRR) or metastasis between 1981 and 2014 were identified using 2 institutional registries: 1) patients treated for recurrent breast cancer and 2) patients who underwent BRCA testing. The frequencies of LRR, sites of metastasis, and breast cancer-specific survival from LRR or metastasis were calculated, and the factors associated with CNS recurrence were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression models.||||The final study cohort included 30 BRCA1 mutation carriers, 32 BRCA2 mutation carriers, and 270 noncarriers. Most BRCA1 carriers (73%) had triple-negative breast cancer; whereas most BRCA2 carriers (72%) had hormone receptor-positive tumors. BRCA1 carriers frequently experienced lung and distant lymph node metastasis, whereas BRCA2 carriers and noncarriers most often experienced bone metastasis. Although CNS disease occurred frequently in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers (53% BRCA1, 50% BRCA2, 25% noncarriers; P < .001), only BRCA2 mutation (P = .006) was significantly associated with CNS metastasis in multivariable analysis controlling for tumor subtype. BRCA2 mutation (P = .01), triple-negative subtype (P < .001), and the involvement of CNS (P < .001) and other non-CNS distant sites (relative to locoregional recurrence or contralateral disease; P < .001) at presentation of recurrent breast cancer were associated with risk for mortality.||||CNS involvement is frequent in women with germline BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations who have metastatic breast cancer. BRCA2 mutation carriers had a significantly higher frequency of CNS metastasis than noncarriers when controlling for breast cancer subtype.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the phenotype of eight patients from seven families harboring POC1B mutations in a cohort of the Japan Eye Genetics Consortium (JEGC).||||Whole-exome sequencing with targeted analyses identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations of the POC1B gene in 7 of 548 families in the JEGC database. Ophthalmologic examinations including the best-corrected visual acuity, perimetry, fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence imaging, optical coherence tomography, and full-field and multifocal electroretinography (ERGs) were performed.||||There were four men and four women whose median age at the onset of symptoms was 15.6 years (range, 6-23 years) and that at the time of examination was 40.3 years (range, 22-67 years). The best-corrected visual acuity ranged from -0.08 to 1.52 logMAR units. The funduscopic appearance was normal in all the cases except in one case with faint mottling in the fovea. Optical coherence tomography revealed an absence of the interdigitation zone and blurred ellipsoid zone in the posterior pole, but the foveal structures were preserved in three cases. The full-field photopic ERGs were reduced or extinguished with normal scotopic responses. The central responses of the multifocal ERGs were preserved in two cases. The diagnosis was either generalized cone dystrophy in five cases or cone dystrophy with foveal sparing in three cases.||||Generalized or peripheral cone dystrophy with normal funduscopic appearance is the representative phenotype of POC1B-associated retinopathy in our cohort.

PKD1-associated autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease with glomerular cysts presenting with nephrotic syndrome caused by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.||||||||Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) may manifest non-nephrotic range proteinuria, but is rarely complicated with nephrotic syndrome. Limited number of reports describe the histology of ADPKD with nephrotic syndrome in detail.||||We encountered a 23-year-old man with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) with small kidney volume and nephrotic syndrome, which eventually progressed to end-stage renal disease. Renal histology showed typical focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and remarkable glomerular cyst formation, but did not reveal tubular cysts. PKD1 mutation was detected in him and his father, who also had PKD with small kidney volume.||||In contrast to tubular cysts which develop along ADPKD progression, glomerular cysts may likely be associated with ADPKD with slower volume progression manifesting small kidney volume. Although previous investigations report that ADPKD with smaller kidney volume is attributed to slower decline in renal function, coexistence of nephrotic-range proteinuria implies complication of other glomerular diseases and needs histological evaluation since it may lead to poor renal outcome.

POLR3B-associated leukodystrophy: clinical, neuroimaging and molecular-genetic analyses in four patients: clinical heterogeneity and novel mutations in POLR3B gene.||||||||White matter disorders represent a spectrum of neurological diseases frequently associated with an unfavourable prognosis and a delay in diagnostics. We report the broad phenotypic spectrum of a rare hypomyelinating leukodystrophy and three novel mutations. Further, we aim to explore the role of the combined clinical and neuroimaging diagnostic approach in the era of whole exome sequencing.||||We present a clinical, neuroimaging and molecular-genetic characterisation of four patients from three families suffering from a rare genetic leukoencephalopathy. Two severely affected siblings (P1, P2) manifested a profound developmental delay, cerebellar symptomatology, microcephaly, failure to thrive, short stature and delayed teeth eruption with oligodontia. The other two patients (P3, P4), on the contrary, suffer from substantially less serious impairment with mild to moderate developmental delay and cerebellar symptomatology, delayed teeth eruption, or well-manageable epilepsy. In all four patients, magnetic resonance revealed cerebellar atrophy and supratentorial hypomyelination with T2-weight hypointensities in the areas of the ventrolateral thalamic nuclei, corticospinal tract and the dentate nuclei.||||Using whole-exome sequencing in P1, P2 and P3, and targeted sequencing in P4, pathogenic variants were disclosed in POLR3B, a gene encoding one of 17 subunits of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase III - all patients were compound heterozygotes for point mutations. Three novel mutations c.727A>G (p.Met243Val) and c.2669G>A (p.Arg890His) (P1, P2), and c.1495G>A (p.Met499Val) (P3) were found. Magnetic resonance revealed the characteristic radiological pattern of POLR3-leukodystrophies in our patients.||||The diagnosis of POLR3-associated leukodystrophies can be significantly accelerated using the combined clinical and neuroradiological recognition pattern. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to raise the awareness of this rare disorder among clinicians. Molecular-genetic analyses are indispensable for a swift diagnosis confirmation in cases of clear clinical suspicion, and for diagnostic search in patients with less pronounced symptomatology. They represent an invaluable tool for unravelling the complex genetic background of heritable white matter disorders.

Prenatal diagnosis of HNF1B-associated renal cysts: Is there a need to differentiate intragenic variants from 17q12 microdeletion syndrome?||||||||17q12 microdeletions containing HNF1B and intragenic variants within this gene are associated with variable developmental, endocrine, and renal anomalies, often already noted prenatally as hyperechogenic/cystic kidneys. Here, we describe prenatal and postnatal phenotypes of seven individuals with HNF1B aberrations and compare their clinical and genetic data to those of previous studies.||||Prenatal sequencing and postnatal chromosomal microarray analysis were performed in seven individuals with renal and/or neurodevelopmental phenotypes. We evaluated HNF1B-related clinical features from 82 studies and reclassified 192 reported intragenic HNF1B variants.||||In a prenatal case, we identified a novel in-frame deletion p.(Gly239del) within the HNF1B DNA-binding domain, a mutational hot spot as demonstrated by spatial clustering analysis and high computational prediction scores. The six postnatally diagnosed individuals harbored 17q12 microdeletions. Literature screening revealed variable reporting of HNF1B-associated clinical traits. Overall, both mutation groups showed a high phenotypic heterogeneity. The reclassification of all previously reported intragenic HNF1B variants provided an up-to-date overview of the mutational spectrum.||||We highlight the value of prenatal HNF1B screening in renal developmental diseases. Standardized clinical reporting and systematic classification of HNF1B variants are necessary for a more accurate risk quantification of prenatal and postnatal clinical features, improving genetic counseling and prenatal decision making.

Dental abnormalities in individuals with pathogenic germline variation in DICER1.||||||||Pathogenic germline variation in the microRNA processing gene DICER1 gives rise to an autosomal dominant, tumor-predisposition disorder. Conditional deletion of Dicer1 in murine dental epithelium shows that it controls tooth patterning, size, number, and shape. The human dental phenotype of people with germline pathogenic variation in DICER1 is unknown. DICER1-carriers (n = 57) and family controls (n = 55) were evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center dental clinic as part of a comprehensive medical evaluation. Digital panoramic radiographs, bite-wing radiographs, and oral photographs were collected. A single observer, blind to DICER1 status, reviewed the dental records and determined the presence or absence of 11 dental characteristics as described in the clinic notes, radiographs, or oral photographs. Subjective phenotypes were reviewed on radiographs by two examiners (blind to DICER1 status) for the presence or absence of the dental characteristics to reduce inconsistencies. By simple association, bulbous crown, periodontitis, and taurodontism were all significant (p < .05). Logistic regression with chi-square maximum likelihood estimates showed that bulbous crown and periodontitis remained significant. Recognition of these phenotypes may aid identification of individuals and families at risk for DICER1-associated neoplasms. These findings may also guide dental care for individuals with germline DICER1 pathogenic variation.

Evaluation of pharmacochaperone-mediated rescue of mutant V2 receptor proteins.||||||||Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus is a rare disorder which is characterized by severe water imbalance in the body. The disease can be acquired or inherited. AVPR2 (arginine vasopressin type 2 receptor) mutations are responsible for genetical type of the disorder. Mutations in the AVPR2 gene may cause loss-of-function due to conformational defects. According to the mutation type, the three-dimensional structure of AVPR2 may be affected even if it is functional and therefore it may not reach the plasma membrane where it is functional. Consequently, it is generally trapped in the Endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus, which are the quality control systems of the cell. Pharmacological chaperones have been used to retrieve these mutant AVPR2s from these quality control systems of the cell and take them to the plasma membrane for therapeutic purposes. In this study, in order to analyze the effects of two pharmacological chaperones, SR121463B and SR49059, we performed total ELISA and surface ELISA studies and cAMP accumulation assays on mutant receptors (G12E, R68W, V88M, ΔR67_G69/G107W, R106C, V162A and T273M). We observed that pharmacological chaperones may act differently on mutated AVPR2s. Cell surface expression of the mutant receptors and cAMP accumulation response, after stimulation with AVP, were mostly improved by these pharmacological chaperones. We believe that, this study presents important results with respect to the process of the variable type of mutated proteins in the cell and may help in developing a process of new types of chaperones.

A3B-catalyzed mutations are likely to promote tumor evolution and cancer progression and, as such, are associated with poor clinical outcomes. However, little is known about cellular processes that regulate A3B. Here, we used a proteomics approach involving affinity purification coupled to MS with human 293T cells to identify cellular proteins that interact with A3B. This approach revealed a specific interaction with cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). We validated and mapped this interaction by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Functional studies and immunofluorescence microscopy experiments in multiple cell lines revealed that A3B is not a substrate for CDK4-Cyclin D1 phosphorylation nor is its deaminase activity modulated. Instead, we found that A3B is capable of disrupting the CDK4-dependent nuclear import of Cyclin D1. We propose that this interaction may favor a more potent antiviral response and simultaneously facilitate cancer mutagenesis.

Immunohistochemistry for ATRX Can Miss ATRX Mutations: Lessons From Neuroblastoma.||||||||Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood with a median age of presentation of 17 months. A common theme in high-risk neuroblastoma is maintenance of telomeres, one mechanism for which involves alternate lengthening of telomeres (ALT) associated with ATRX gene mutations. Mutations are believed to result in loss of ATRX protein, and therefore immunohistochemistry is used to detect mutations. We screened 133 cases of neuroblastoma by ATRX immunohistochemistry, and found 9 cases with partial to total absence of ATRX. Sequencing for ATRX mutations detected a mutation in 1 of 9 cases, suggesting immunostaining was not reliable for detecting mutations. To correlate immunostaining with ALT, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for ALT was performed in 6 of these cases and 5 (from 4 patients) showed ALT, implying impaired ATRX protein function, despite the failure to identify a mutation. Two other cases with large deletions in the ATRX gene showed diffusely positive staining for ATRX protein but showed ALT by FISH. Four of the 6 patients with ALT-positive tumors were over 5 years old. Therefore, 29 additional patients 5 years old and above with ATRX-positive tumors were screened for ALT by FISH and 6 additional cases with ALT were detected, bringing the total to 29% (10/34) of children 5 years old and above, 70% of which showed positive ATRX immunohistochemistry. Patients with ATRX mutations in neuroblastoma tend to have a more chronic and progressive course of disease. Screening neuroblastoma tumors at diagnosis for ATRX mutations may help identify patients who might benefit from personalized therapy directed against ALT. However, relaying on negative immunohistochemistry for ATRX protein to identify ALT in neuroblastoma may miss a significant proportion of patients. The addition of FISH for ALT as part of the diagnostic workup, especially for older children (5 y old and above), would help ensure that patients are correctly identified for anti-ALT therapy.

The path forward for anti-programmed cell death-1 therapy in gliomas.||||||||Checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) represent the forefront of novel immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of solid cancers. However, the clinical development of CPIs in glioblastoma (GBM) has been challenging owing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and, possibly, low tumor mutation burden. Here, we review possible mechanisms responsible for the success of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) blockade in patients with hypermutated GBM, recent clinical trials of anti-PD-1 monotherapy, trials incorporating neoadjuvant strategies, and trials of immunotherapy combination approaches in GBM. Mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy and methods to overcome these challenges are also discussed.||||Although two large phase III trials failed to demonstrate the superior efficacy of CPI in comparison with the standard of care in newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM, recent studies suggest that opportunities exist in some patients with GBM. A phase II study showed longer survival in patients with recurrent GBM who received neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy than in those who received it as adjuvant therapy. In addition, cases of response to anti-PD-1 therapy in GBM patients with clonal hypermutator tumors have been reported.||||Even though anti-PD-1 therapy does not seem to provide a benefit for molecularly unselected GBM patients, the success of PD-1 blockade in certain subsets of patients is encouraging.

Atopic dermatitis without serum immunoglobulin E elevation or loss-of-function filaggrin gene mutation in a patient with X-linked agammaglobulinemia.||||||||A case of atopic dermatitis (AD) with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), which is one of the primary immunodeficiency diseases, is reported. A 12-year-old boy had suffered from dry skin and recurrent itchy eruptions since he was 2 years old, and he was diagnosed as having XLA at the age of 4 years. His total immunoglobulin (Ig)E level was 7 IU/mL, even with regular Ig replacement therapy. Furthermore, filaggrin (FLG) mutations known in the Japanese population were not found. His skin lesions were well controlled by the application of a mild-class topical steroid and a moisturizer, though he developed folliculitis due to Staphylococcus aureus infection during treatment with a strong-class topical steroid. This case suggests that the FLG mutation and IgE-mediated sensitization are not necessary to induce AD skin manifestation.

The primary outcome was decrease in fasting intact FGF23 by ≥20% from baseline. Six adults (three male, three female) having the FGF23-R176Q mutation were enrolled; five completed the 12-month protocol. At baseline three of five subjects had severely symptomatic hypophosphatemia (phosphorus <2.5 mg/dL) and received calcitriol with or without phosphate concurrent with oral iron during the trial. The primary outcome was met by 4 of 5 (80%) subjects all by month 4, and 5 of 5 had normal intact FGF23 at month 12. Median (minimum, maximum) intact FGF23 concentration decreased from 172 (20, 192) pg/mL at baseline to 47 (17, 78) pg/mL at month 4 and 42 (19, 63) pg/mL at month 12. Median ferritin increased from 18.6 (7.7, 82.5) ng/mL at baseline to 78.0 (49.6, 261.0) ng/mL at month 12. During iron treatment, all three subjects with baseline hypophosphatemia normalized serum phosphorus, had markedly improved symptoms, and were able to discontinue calcitriol and phosphate. Oral iron repletion normalized FGF23 and phosphorus in symptomatic, iron-deficient ADHR subjects. Thus, the standard approach to ADHR should include recognition, treatment, and prevention of iron deficiency. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

NTHL1 biallelic mutations seldom cause colorectal cancer, serrated polyposis or a multi-tumor phenotype, in absence of colorectal adenomas.||||||||The cancer-predisposing syndrome caused by biallelic mutations in NTHL1 may not be a solely colorectal cancer (CRC) and polyposis syndrome but rather a multi-tumor recessive disease. The presence of ≤10 adenomas in several mutation carriers suggests a possible causal role of NTHL1 in hereditary or early-onset nonpolyposis CRC. The involvement of NTHL1 in serrated/hyperplastic polyposis remains unexplored. The aim of our study is to elucidate the role of NTHL1 in the predisposition to personal or familial history of multiple tumor types, familial/early-onset nonpolyposis CRC, and serrated polyposis. NTHL1 mutational screening was performed in 312 cancer patients with personal or family history of multiple tumor types, 488 with hereditary nonpolyposis CRC, and 96 with serrated/hyperplastic polyposis. While no biallelic mutation carriers were identified in patients with personal and/or family history of multiple tumor types or with serrated polyposis, one was identified among the 488 nonpolyposis CRC patients. The carrier of c.268C>T (p.Q90*) and 550-1G>A was diagnosed with CRC and meningioma at ages 37 and 45 respectively, being reclassified as attenuated adenomatous polyposis after the cumulative detection of 26 adenomas. Our findings suggest that biallelic mutations in NTHL1 rarely cause CRC, a personal/familial multi-tumor history, or serrated polyposis, in absence of adenomas.

Lymphoid Neoplasms With Plasmablastic Differentiation: A Comprehensive Review and Diagnostic Approaches.||||||||Plasmablastic neoplasms encompass several entities including plasmablastic lymphoma, plasmablastic plasmacytoma/multiple myeloma, primary effusion lymphoma and its extracavitary variant, anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive large B-cell lymphoma, and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8)-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified. Morphologically, the tumor cells are large with eccentrically located nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and basophilic/amphophilic cytoplasm. Immunophenotypically, the tumor cells express plasma cell-related antigens including CD38, CD138, interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF4)/MUM1, PR domain zinc finger protein-1 (PRDM1), and/or X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1), with frequent loss of CD20. These tumors are diagnostically challenging for general pathologists due to their overlapping morphology and immunophenotype, and due to their rarity, and particularly so when clinical and radiologic information is insufficient. We also discuss HHV8-negative effusion-based lymphoma due to its overlapping features with primary effusion lymphoma. In this review, we focus on the useful diagnostic markers and pertinent molecular findings in these distinct entities and propose a practical diagnostic algorithm using anaplastic lymphoma kinase, HHV8, in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNA, immunoglobulin M, light chain stains, and clinicoradiologic criteria to avoid misdiagnosis. At the molecular level, MYC protein overexpression with or without MYC rearrangement and PRDM1-inactivating mutations or deletions are noted in a subset of such tumors, especially in plasmablastic lymphoma. Prognosis in these entities is dismal with conventional CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy. Therefore, novel target therapies, such as anti-CD30 agents, and/or immune blockade therapy, are potential treatment options in the future.

Usefulness of droplet digital PCR and Sanger sequencing for detection of FGFR3 mutation in bladder cancer.||||||||The purpose of our research was to determine the usefulness of different methods for detecting Y373C mutation of gene FGFR3.||||138 primary bladder cancer patients (71cases G1 and 67 cases G2-G3) were included in the study. Tumor tissue and urine samples were collected and kept frozen until the isolation of DNA. Sanger sequencing was applied for detecting mutation in cancer and ddPCR was utilized for urine assessment.||||ddPCR appears to be more effective and it identified FGFR3 mutation (Y373C) in urinary sediment in 20.3% of cases whereas Sanger sequencing did in 15.5%. Only in 8/39 (20.5%) cases the mutation was observed both in urine and tissue. In 12/39 (30.8%) cases (5G1 and 7 G2-G3) we did not detect any FGFR3 mutation in urine although it was confirmed by sequencing. We only found mutation in urine in 20/39 cases (15 G1, 5 G2-G3) (51.3%). The correlation between the presence of FGFR3 mutations and better survival was confirmed. The Log-Rank test indicates a significant difference in the likelihood of survival for patients with the FGFR3 mutation but without recurrence (Cox's F-test P = 0.17006; Log-Rank Test P = 0.00059).||||ddPCR appeared to be more sensitive method for detection FGFR3 gene mutation particularly for detecting low levels of tumor DNA amongst a large excess of nontumor DNA. It is significant as the implementation of such markers into routine practice could be beneficial. The prospective study in larger cohort is needed.

Suspected mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the probands, their family members and 200 unrelated healthy controls. Gross deletion was confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis.||||Two mutations were detected in the pedigrees, which included EXT2 gene c.337_338insG mutation in pedigree 1 and deletion of entire EXT1 in pedigree 2. Analysis of sequencing data revealed that a novel heterozygous mutation (c.337_338insG) in EXT2 gene in proband 1 and his father. The same mutation was not found among healthy family members and 200 unrelated healthy controls. As shown by NGS and MLPA analysis, proband 2 carried a heterozygous deletion of entire EXT1 gene. The same deletion was also found in her mother by qPCR.||||Mutations of the EXT1 and EXT2 genes probably underlie the HME in both pedigrees. NGS combined with Sanger sequencing, qPCR and MLPA is effective for attaining the diagnosis.

A comprehensive analysis of NPHS1 gene mutations in patients with sporadic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.||||||||Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is still one of the common causes of refractory nephrotic syndrome. Nephrin, encoded by podocyte-specific NPHS1 gene, participated in the pathogenesis of FSGS. The sites of NPHS1 mutations in FSGS is not clarified very well. In this study, we investigated the specific mutations of NPHS1 gene in Chinese patients with sporadic FSGS.||||A total of 309 patients with sporadic FSGS were collected and screened for NPHS1 mutations by second-generation sequencing. The variants were compared with those extracted from 2504 healthy controls in the 1000 Genomes Project. The possible pathogenic roles of missense variants were predicted by three different software. We also compared these candidate causal mutations with those summarized from the previous studies.||||Thirty-two genetic mutations of NPHS1 gene were identified in FSGS patients, including 12 synonymous mutations, 17 missense mutations, 1 splicing mutation, and 2 intron mutations, of which c.G3315A (p.S1105S) was the most common variant (261/309). A novel missense mutation c.G2638 T (p.V880F) and a novel splicing mutation 35830957 C > T were identified in FSGS patients. The frequencies of the four synonymous mutations (c.C294T [p.I98I], c.C2223T [p.T741 T], c.C2289T [p.V763 V], c.G3315A [p.S1105S]) were much higher in FSGS patients than in controls. The frequencies of the four missense mutations (c.G349A [p.E117K], c.G1339A [p.E447K], c.G1802C [p.G601A], c.C2398T [p.R800C]) were much higher and one (c.A3230G [p.N1077S]) was lower in FSGS patients than in controls. Five missense mutations, c.C616A (p.P206T), c.G1802C (p.G601A), c.C2309T (p.P770L), c.G2869C (p.V957 L), and c.C3274T (p.R1092C), were predicted to be pathogenic mutations by software analysis.||||NPHS1 gene mutations were quite common in sporadic FSGS patients. We strongly recommend mutation analysis of the NPHS1 gene in the clinical management of FSGS patients.

Splanchnic vein thromboses associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms: An international, retrospective study on 518 cases.||||||||Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN) course can be complicated by thrombosis involving unusual sites as the splanchnic veins (SVT). Their management is challenging, given their composite vascular risk. We performed a retrospective, cohort study in the framework of the International Working Group for MPN Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT), and AIRC-Gruppo Italiano Malattie Mieloproliferative (AGIMM). A total of 518 MPN-SVT cases were collected and compared with 1628 unselected, control MPN population, matched for disease subtype. Those with MPN-SVT were younger (median 44 years) and enriched in females compared to controls; PV (37.1%) and ET (34.4%) were the most frequent diagnoses. JAK2V617F mutation was highly prevalent (90.2%), and 38.6% of cases had an additional hypercoagulable disorder. SVT recurrence rate was 1.6 per 100 patient-years. Vitamin K-antagonists (VKA) halved the incidence of recurrence (OR 0.48), unlike cytoreduction (OR 0.96), and were not associated with overall or gastrointestinal bleeding in multivariable analysis. Esophageal varices were the only independent predictor for major bleeding (OR 17.4). Among MPN-SVT, risk of subsequent vascular events was skewed towards venous thromboses compared to controls. However, MPN-SVT clinical course was overall benign: SVT were enriched in PMF with lower IPSS, resulting in significantly longer survival than controls; survival was not affected in PV and slightly reduced in ET. MPN-U with SVT (n = 55) showed a particularly indolent phenotype, with no signs of disease evolution. In the to-date largest, contemporary cohort of MPN-SVT, VKA were confirmed effective in preventing recurrence, unlike cytoreduction, and safe; the major risk factor for bleeding was esophageal varices that therefore represent a major therapeutic target.

Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Gene Mutations in 22 Chinese Pedigrees with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis.||||||||BACKGROUND Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which has a very high tendency of progression to colorectal cancer, is mainly caused by mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. This study systematically screened the APC mutations and observed the correlation of APC mutations with clinical manifestations of FAP. MATERIAL AND METHODS Eighty subjects (probands and their family members of 22 FAP pedigrees) were enrolled, underwent abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography, and colonoscopic examinations, and were assessed for APC mutations between January 2010 and June 2015 at Tianjin Union Medical Center. Peripheral blood was collected from subjects, and DNA was extracted and screened for APC mutations using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for large-fragment deletions or PCR-denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography with DNA sequencing for micromutations. RESULTS Nineteen of 22 FAP pedigrees were found to have mutations of APC, and 17 types APC mutations were identified. All the mutations were heterozygosity with autosomal dominant inheritance. APC mutations included 8 caused by frameshift, 3 by aberrant splicing, 2 by missense mutation, 2 by nonsense mutation, and 2 by large-fragment deletion. Frameshift mutation was the most common type of APC mutation, and Coding DNA Sequence 15 was the most common mutation site. Five novel APC mutations, including 1 with large-fragment deletion, were identified. CONCLUSIONS We systematically screened 17 mutations of APC from 22 Chinese pedigrees with FAP. This study will broaden the spectrum of known APC germline mutations and help understand the types and distribution of APC mutations among Chinese patients with FAP.

RPE65 mutation frequency and phenotypic variation according to exome sequencing in a tertiary centre for genetic eye diseases in China.||||||||Retinoid isomerohydrolase RPE65 has received a tremendous amount of attention due to successful clinical gene therapy for Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) cases caused by RPE65 mutations. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of RPE65 mutations and the associated phenotypes based on exome sequencing.||||RPE65 variants were collected from exome sequencing data obtained from 2133 probands with different forms of hereditary retinal degeneration (HRD). Clinical data were collected from probands with homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in RPE65. Associated phenotypes were characterized based on clinical data.||||Biallelic RPE65 mutations were detected in 18 families, including eight with LCA, five with early-onset retinal degeneration, four with fundus albipunctatus-like (FA-like) changes and one with high hyperopia. These cases accounted for approximately 3.0% (8/269) of LCA and 0.8% (18/2133) of HRD cases. An almost identical FA-like change was identified in seven patients from four unrelated families with RPE65 mutations. Classification of mutations suggested that FA-like changes may be associated with biallelic missense mutations in RPE65.||||Fundus albipunctatus-like (FA-like) change, a common characteristic fundus sign in RPE65 biallelic mutations, was unexpected but was confirmed by the finding that affected siblings from different families exhibited similar phenotypes. These results enrich our understanding of RPE65 mutation frequencies and their associated phenotypic variants.

Mutation-Derived Neoantigens for Cancer Immunotherapy.||||||||Mutation-derived neoantigens distinguish tumor from normal cells. T cells can sense the HLA-presented mutations, recognize tumor cells as non-self and destroy them. Therapeutically, immunotherapy antibodies can increase the virulence of the immune system by increasing T-cell cytotoxicity targeted toward neoantigens. Neoantigen vaccines act through antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, to activate patient-endogenous T cells that recognize vaccine-encoded mutations. Infusion of mutation-targeting T cells by adoptive cell therapy (ACT) directly increases the number and frequency of cytotoxic T cells recognizing and killing tumor cells. At the same time, publicly-funded consortia have profiled tumor genomes across many indications, identifying mutations in each tumor. For example, we find basal and HER2 positive tumors contain more mutated proteins and more TP53 mutations than luminal A/B breast tumors. HPV negative tumors have more mutated proteins than HPV positive head and neck tumors and in agreement with the hypothesis that HPV activity interferes with p53 activity, only 14% of the HPV positive mutations have TP53 mutations vs. 86% of the HPV negative tumors. Lung adenocarcinomas in smokers have over four times more mutated proteins relative to those in never smokers (median 248 vs. 61, respectively). With an eye toward immunotherapy applications, we review the spectrum of mutations in multiple indications, show variations in indication sub-types, and examine intra- and inter-indication prevalence of re-occurring mutation neoantigens that could be used for warehouse vaccines and ACT.

To identify whether the PPM1D mutation predisposes patients to such cancers or if it results from the cancer and therapy, somatic PPM1D mutations in association with previous cancer and chemotherapy need to be explored.||||We performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of blood samples from patients suspected to have hereditary cancer. We grouped the patients according to their diagnoses and history of chemotherapy. For the patients with PPM1D mutations in blood, tumor tissue specimens were examined for the PPM1D mutation using conventional sequencing.||||A total of 1,195 patients, including 719 patients with breast cancer and 240 with ovarian cancer, were tested, and four (~0.3%) had the truncating mutation in PPM1D. All truncating mutations were in exon 6, in mosaic form, with a mean allele fraction of 11.15%. While 395 out of the 1,195 patients had undergone chemotherapy, the four with the truncating mutation had a history of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. No corresponding mutations were identified in the tumor tissues.||||We investigated the frequency of the somatic mosaic PPM1D mutation, in patients with breast or ovarian cancer, which is suggested to be low and related to a history of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. It may be a marker of previous exposure to selective pressure for cells with an impaired DNA damage response.

CAL2 monoclonal antibody is a rapid and sensitive assay for the detection of calreticulin mutations in essential thrombocythemia patients.||||||||-wild type patients CALR mutations were searched on peripheral blood and CAL2 immunostaining was performed on bone marrow. In addition, bone marrow biopsies were histologically reviewed for megakaryocytic features. Thirty-one patients (18%) were CALR-mutated. Concordance between molecular and immunohistological detection of CALR mutations was near complete, albeit a single patient was found to be positive by molecular tests only. Two patterns were defined in CAL2-positive bone marrow samples, characterized by staining of almost only megakaryocytes (pattern A: 41%) or staining of megakaryocytes and ≥ 2% small non megakaryocytic elements (pattern B: 59%), at least partially being myeloid precursors. Pattern B biopsies had higher cellularity and number of megakaryocytes compared to pattern A samples. In this series, CAL2 allowed rapid and cost-efficient identification of CALR-mutated ET patients. The biological significance of different staining pattern should be confirmed in wider and independent series.

Integrative genomic analysis identifies associations of molecular alterations to APOBEC and BRCA1/2 mutational signatures in breast cancer.||||||||The observed mutations in cancer are the result of ~30 mutational processes, which stamp particular mutational signatures (MS). Nevertheless, it is still not clear which genomic alterations correlate to several MS. Here, a method to analyze associations of genomic data with MS is presented and applied to The Cancer Genome Atlas breast cancer data revealing promising associations.||||The MS were discretized into clusters whose extremes were statistically associated with mutations, copy number, and gene expression data.||||Known associations for apolipoprotein B editing complex (APOBEC) and for BRCA1 and BRCA2 support the proposal. For BRCA1/2, mutations in ARAP3, three focal deletions, and one amplification were detected. Around 50 mutated genes for the two APOBEC signatures were identified including three kinesins (KIF13A, KIF1B, KIF4A), three ubiquitins (USP45, UBR4, UBR1), and two demethylases (KDM5B, KDM5C) among other genes also connected to DNA damage pathways. The results suggest novel roles for other genes currently not involved in DNA repair. The altered expression program was very high for the BRCA1/2 signature, high for APOBEC signature 13 clearly associated to immune response, and low for APOBEC signature 2. The remaining signatures show scarce associations.||||Specific genetic alterations can be associated with particular MS.

Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumors share a distinct DNA methylation profile and mutations in FGFR1, with recurrent co-mutation of PIK3CA and NF1.||||||||Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor (RGNT) is a rare brain neoplasm that primarily affects young adults. Although alterations affecting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway have been associated with this low-grade entity, comprehensive molecular investigations of RGNT in larger series have not been performed to date, and an integrated view of their genetic and epigenetic profiles is still lacking. Here we describe a genome-wide DNA methylation and targeted sequencing-based characterization of a molecularly distinct class of tumors (n = 30), initially identified through genome-wide DNA methylation screening among a cohort of > 30,000 tumors, of which most were diagnosed histologically as RGNT. FGFR1 hotspot mutations were observed in all tumors analyzed, with co-occurrence of PIK3CA mutations in about two-thirds of the cases (63%). Additional loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1 were detected in a subset of cases (33%). Notably, in contrast to most other low-grade gliomas, these tumors often displayed co-occurrence of two or even all three of these mutations. Our data highlight that molecularly defined RGNTs are characterized by highly recurrent combined genetic alterations affecting both MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways. Thus, these two pathways appear to synergistically interact in the formation of RGNT, and offer potential therapeutic targets for this disease.

Epithelioid variant of gastrointestinal stromal tumor harboring PDGFRA mutation and MLH1 gene alteration: A case report.||||||||Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most important and common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, especially in the stomach. GISTs are usually driven by activating mutations in either KIT or PDGFRA genes. It is known that activating gene mutations predicts, to a certain extent, not only the morphology of the tumor cells but also a response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Here, we present a case of an epithelioid variant of GIST harboring PDGFRA and MLH1 gene alterations in the stomach of a 55-year-old Japanese woman. The tumor of 98 mm with multiple cysts showed exophytic growth from the gastric fundus. Histopathologically, it consisted of scattered medium-sized epithelioid tumor cells in a loose myxoid background. Based on c-kit and DOG-1 immunoreactivity and a PDGFRA mutation (p.Trp559_Arg560del), the tumor was diagnosed as an epithelioid variant GIST. Interestingly, it had a gene alteration (p.Met524Ile) in the MLH1 gene of unknown pathogenicity. It was assigned to Group 3a (low risk for malignant behavior). After surgery, the patient has been on imatinib therapy and disease-free for 10 months.

The rate of IDH2 mutation in M4 and M5 is higher. IDH2 gene mutations associate with NPMl gene mutations, but R172K mutations not associates with NPM1mutation. IDH2 gene mutations associate with prognosis of AML patients, R140Q mutations have no effect on prognosis of patients, but R172K mutations may be the molecular markers for poor prognosis in AML patients.

Patched homolog 1 (PTCHI) gene mutations can predict the outcome of chronic myeloid leukemia patients?||||||||. There is accumulating evidence that Hh signaling plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of various haemopoietic malignancies. Particular interest has focused on the role of Hh signaling in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The Hh signaling is increased in BCR-ABL+ve progenitor cells and Hh signaling is further up regulated with disease progression.||||The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and types of PTCH1 gene mutations in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) patients and to correlate the effect of these mutations on the prognosis and outcome of CML and for predicting the imatinib response in CML patients.||||The study included fifty newly diagnosed CML patients and ten healthy volunteers (the control group) to verify the presence or absence of PTCH1 gene mutation. The patients were subjected to clinical examination, routine laboratory investigations, bone marrow examination, Cytogenetic evaluations of t(9;22) and molecular study of BCR-ABL fusion gene. All participants in this study were subjected to the assessment for the presence of PTCH1 gene mutation by DNA extraction followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of genomic DNA corresponding to exon 23 of PTCH1 gene, purification of amplified PCR product, followed by sequencing analysis for detection of PTCH1 gene exon 23 mutations and the types of these mutations.||||Four types of mutations of PTCH1 gene were detected in 24 CML patients (48%), three types of them were missence while the fourth type was frame shift mutation. There was no significant association between PTCH1 gene mutation and percent of BCR-ABL fusion genes at level less than 10% at 3 months of treatment, complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at one year, disease free survival and overall survival. However there was significant association between PTCH1 gene mutation and imatinib failure (P=0.03).||||PTCH1 gene mutation should be considered a promising molecular marker for predicting the probability of imatinib response in CML patients. Hedgehog pathway activation in CML patients can raise a possibility that combinations of ABL and Hh inhibitors might offer a new treatment strategy in CML and might help to effectively cure this disease.

Regulation of Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 by Iron, EPO, and HIF.||||||||Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is the key hormone produced in bone critical for phosphate homeostasis. Elevated serum phosphorus and 1,25dihydroxyvitaminD stimulates FGF23 production to promote renal phosphate excretion and decrease 1,25dihydroxyvitaminD synthesis. Thus completing the feedback loop and suppressing FGF23. Unexpectedly, studies of common and rare heritable disorders of phosphate handling identified links between iron and FGF23 demonstrating novel regulation outside the phosphate pathway.||||Iron deficiency combined with an FGF23 cleavage mutation was found to induce the autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets phenotype. Physiological responses to iron deficiency, such as erythropoietin production as well as hypoxia inducible factor activation, have been indicated in regulating FGF23. Additionally, specific iron formulations, used to treat iron deficiency, alter post-translational processing thereby shifting FGF23 protein secretion.||||Molecular and clinical studies revealed that iron deficiency, through several mechanisms, alters FGF23 at the transcriptional and post-translational level. This review will focus upon the novel discoveries elucidated between iron, its regulators, and their influence on FGF23 bioactivity.

Loss of function BMP4 mutation supports the implication of the BMP/TGF-β pathway in the etiology of combined pituitary hormone deficiency.||||||||Despite BMP4 signaling being critical to Rathke's pouch induction and maintenance during early stages of pituitary development, its implication in the etiology of combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) and other clinical presentations of congenital hypopituitarism has not yet been definitely demonstrated. We report here the first CPHD patient with a de novo pathogenic loss-of-function variant in BMP4. A 6-year-old boy, with macrocephaly, myopia/astigmatism, mild psychomotor retardation, anterior pituitary hypoplasia and ectopic posterior pituitary, clinically diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency, and central hypothyroidism, was referred for genetic analysis of CPHD. Targeted NGS analysis with a custom panel (n = 310 genes) identified a novel heterozygous de novo nonsense variant, NM_001202.5:c.794G > A, p.(Trp265*) in BMP4, which introduces a premature stop codon in the BMP4 pro-domain, impairing the transcription of the TGF-β mature peptide domain. Additional relevant variants in other genes implicated in pituitary development signaling pathways such as SMAD4 and E2F4 (BMP/TGF-pathway), ALMS1 (NOTCH-pathway), and TSHZ1 (Prokineticin-pathway), were also identified. Our results support the implication of the BMP/TGF-β signaling pathway in the etiology of CPHD and suggest that oligogenic contribution of additional inherited variants may modify the phenotypic expressivity of BMP4 pathogenic variants.

However, resistance to these agents uniformly develops. Recently, mutations in the KEAP1-NFE2L2 pathway have been implicated as a potential mechanism of acquired EGFR TKI resistance.||||We examined all patients with metastatic NSCLC with mutations in both EGFR and KEAP1/NFE2L2/CUL3 identified on next generation sequencing from 2015 - 2018. These patients were compared to a NSCLC control cohort with mutations in EGFR and wild type in KEAP1/NFE2L2/CUL3 matched on the basis of sex, smoking status, age and race. Time to treatment failure on EGFR TKI therapy and overall survival were examined.||||Among 228 EGFR mutant NSCLCs, 17 (7%) also carried mutations in KEAP1, NFE2L2, or CUL3. The most common co-mutation in both the KEAP1/NFE2L2/CUL3 mutant and wild-type cohort was TP53. Patients with KEAP1/NFE2L2/CUL3 mutations had a shorter median time to treatment failure on EGFR TKI (4.7 months) compared with the wild-type matched cohort (13.0 months), p= 0.0014. There was no difference in overall survival.||||For NSCLC patients with mutations in EGFR, co-mutations in KEAP1/NFE2L2/CUL3 are associated with significantly decreased time to treatment failure. Our results suggest that these mutations represent a mechanism of intrinsic resistance to TKI treatment.

In the suspicion of Primary Hypoaldosteronism, correction of plasmatic electrolytes and replacement therapy with Fludrocortisone were promptly started. The subsequent evidence of low plasmatic and urinary cortisol and increased ACTH required the start of Hydrocortisone replacement therapy and it defined a clinical picture of adrenal insufficiency.

AKT1 internal tandem duplications and point mutations are the genetic hallmarks of sclerosing pneumocytoma.||||||||Sclerosing pneumocytoma is a unique benign neoplasm of the lungs. The molecular alterations in sclerosing pneumocytoma are not well understood. In a previous whole-exome sequencing study, recurrent AKT1 point mutation was observed in about half of the cases of sclerosing pneumocytoma. However, in the remaining half, cancer-related mutations have still not been identified. In this study, we first analyzed the raw sequence data from the previous whole-exome sequencing study (PRJNA297066 cohort). Using Genomon-ITDetector, a special software for detection of internal tandem duplications, we identified recurrent internal tandem duplications in the AKT1 gene in 22 of the 44 tumor samples (50%). All the cases positive for AKT1 internal tandem duplications lacked AKT1 point mutations. Next, we performed targeted next-generation sequencing in an independent cohort of sclerosing pneumocytoma from our hospital (VGH-TPE cohort), and again identified recurrent AKT1 internal tandem duplications in 20 of the 40 (50%) tumor samples analyzed. The internal tandem duplications resulted in duplications of 7 to 16 amino acids in a narrow region of the Pleckstrin homology domain of the AKT1 protein. This region contains the interaction interface between the Pleckstrin homology and kinase domains, which is known to play a critical role in the activation of the AKT1 protein. Moreover, we found that AKT1 internal tandem duplications were mutually exclusive of other forms of AKT1 mutations, including point mutations and short indels. Taking all forms of AKT1 mutations together, we detected AKT1 mutations in almost all the sclerosing pneumocytomas in our study (PRJNA297066 cohort: 41 out of 44 cases, 93%; VGH-TPE cohort: 40 out of 40 cases, 100%). Our results suggest that AKT1 mutation is the genetic hallmark of sclerosing pneumocytoma. These results would help in better understanding of the pathogenesis of sclerosing pneumocytoma.

Notch1 signaling in NOTCH1-mutated mantle cell lymphoma depends on Delta-Like ligand 4 and is a potential target for specific antibody therapy.||||||||NOTCH1 gene mutations in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) have been described in about 5-10% of cases and are associated with significantly shorter survival rates. The present study aimed to investigate the biological impact of this mutation in MCL and its potential as a therapeutic target.||||Activation of Notch1 signaling upon ligand-stimulation and inhibitory effects of the monoclonal anti-Notch1 antibody OMP-52M51 in NOTCH1-mutated and -unmutated MCL cells were assessed by Western Blot and gene expression profiling. Effects of OMP-52M51 treatment on tumor cell migration and tumor angiogenesis were evaluated with chemotaxis and HUVEC tube formation assays. The expression of Delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4) in MCL lymph nodes was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. A MCL mouse model was used to assess the activity of OMP-52M51 in vivo.||||Notch1 expression can be effectively stimulated in NOTCH1-mutated Mino cells by DLL4, whereas in the NOTCH1-unmutated cell line JeKo-1, less effect was observed upon any ligand-stimulation. DLL4 was expressed by histiocytes in both, NOTCH1-mutated and -unmutated MCL lymph nodes. Treatment of NOTCH1-mutated MCL cells with the monoclonal anti-Notch1 antibody OMP-52M51 effectively prevented DLL4-dependent activation of Notch1 and suppressed the induction of numerous direct Notch target genes involved in lymphoid biology, lymphomagenesis and disease progression. Importantly, in lymph nodes from primary MCL cases with NOTCH1/2 mutations, we detected an upregulation of the same gene sets as observed in DLL4-stimulated Mino cells. Furthermore, DLL4 stimulation of NOTCH1-mutated Mino cells enhanced tumor cell migration and angiogenesis, which could be abolished by treatment with OMP-52M51. Importantly, the effects observed were specific for NOTCH1-mutated cells as they did not occur in the NOTCH1-wt cell line JeKo-1. Finally, we confirmed the potential activity of OMP-52M51 to inhibit DLL4-induced Notch1-Signaling in vivo in a xenograft mouse model of MCL.||||DLL4 effectively stimulates Notch1 signaling in NOTCH1-mutated MCL and is expressed by the microenvironment in MCL lymph nodes. Our results indicate that specific inhibition of the Notch1-ligand-receptor interaction might provide a therapeutic alternative for a subset of MCL patients.

PTK7 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 95 patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Correlations of PTK7 expression levels with clinicopathological parameters, EGFR mutation and EML4-ALK fusion were examined. Positive PTK7 expression was detected in 47.4% of lung adenocarcinoma. PTK7 expression was associated with gender (P=0.024), lymph node metastasis (P<0.001), ALK mutation (P=0.050), and EGFR mutations (P=0.014). No significant association was found between PTK7 expression and age (P=0.831), differentiation (P=0.494), adenocarcinoma subtype (P=0.098) and Ki67 (P=0.473). Our data suggest that PTK7 plays an oncogenic role in lung adenocarcinoma and may be a molecular marker for lymph node metastasis.

Functional and topographic effects on DNA methylation in IDH1/2 mutant cancers.||||||||IDH1/2 mutations are early drivers present in diverse human cancer types arising in various tissue sites. IDH1/2 mutation is known to induce a global hypermethylator phenotype. However, the effects on DNA methylation across IDH mutant cancers and functionally different genome regions, remain unknown. We analyzed DNA methylation data from IDH1/2 mutant acute myeloid leukemia, oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma, solid papillary breast carcinoma with reverse polarity, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, which clustered by their embryonal origin. Hypermethylated common probes affect predominantly gene bodies while promoters in IDH1/2 mutant cancers remain unmethylated. Enhancers showed global hypermethylation, however commonly hypomethylated enhancers were associated with tissue differentiation and cell fate determination. We demonstrate that some chromosomes, chromosomal arms and chromosomal regions are more affected by IDH1/2 mutations while others remain resistant to IDH1/2 mutation induced methylation changes. Therefore IDH1/2 mutations have different methylation effect on different parts of the genome, which may be regulated by different mechanisms.

PRRT2 mutations in Japanese patients with benign infantile epilepsy and paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia.||||||||This study was performed to clarify the clinical features of Japanese patients with PRRT2 mutations.||||The PRRT2 gene was analyzed in 135 patients with benign infantile epilepsy (BIE) or paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) using a direct sequencing method: 92 patients had BIE alone, 25 had both BIE and PKD, and 18 had PKD alone. Of the cases, 105 were familial, and 30 were sporadic. Clinical information was collected using a structured questionnaire.||||PRRT2 mutations were identified in 104 patients. Among the familial cases, PRRT2 mutations were found in at least one individual in 21 of 28 families with BIE alone, in 26 of 27 families with infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis, and in 2 of 3 families with PKD alone. Among the sporadic cases, PRRT2 mutations were observed in 7 of 25 patients with BIE alone, in 1 of 1 patient with BIE and PKD, and in 3 of 4 patients with PKD alone. The c.649dupC mutation was the most frequent, followed by the c.981C > G mutation. Among the patients with epilepsy, the median age at BIE onset was 5 months, the median age at the last seizure was 6 months, and the median number of seizures was 5.||||PRRT2 mutations were found in 68% of Japanese probands with BIE or PKD. The phenotypes of BIE associated with PRRT2 mutations were consistent with those of BIE diagnosed clinically.

Activation of PDGF pathway links LMNA mutation to dilated cardiomyopathy.||||||||Lamin A/C (LMNA) is one of the most frequently mutated genes associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). DCM related to mutations in LMNA is a common inherited cardiomyopathy that is associated with systolic dysfunction and cardiac arrhythmias. Here we modelled the LMNA-related DCM in vitro using patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). Electrophysiological studies showed that the mutant iPSC-CMs displayed aberrant calcium homeostasis that led to arrhythmias at the single-cell level. Mechanistically, we show that the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signalling pathway is activated in mutant iPSC-CMs compared to isogenic control iPSC-CMs. Conversely, pharmacological and molecular inhibition of the PDGF signalling pathway ameliorated the arrhythmic phenotypes of mutant iPSC-CMs in vitro. Taken together, our findings suggest that the activation of the PDGF pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of LMNA-related DCM and point to PDGF receptor-β (PDGFRB) as a potential therapeutic target.

Distinct histomorphological features are associated with IDH1 mutation in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.||||||||Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma has known histological heterogeneity. Mutations in IDH1 (mIDH1) define a molecular subclass of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and IDH-targeted therapies are in development. Characterizing mIDH1 ICC histomorphology is of clinical interest for efficient identification. Resected ICCs with targeted next-generation sequencing by MSK-IMPACT were selected. Clinical data were obtained. By slide review, blinded to IDH status, data were collected for histology type, mucin production, necrosis, fibrosis, cytoplasm cell shape (low cuboidal, plump cuboidal/polygonal, and columnar), and architectural pattern (anastomosing, tubular, compact tubular, and solid). A tumor was considered architecturally heterogeneous if no dominant pattern represented ≥75% of the tumor. Parameters were compared between mIDH1and IDH wild-type controls. In the examined cohort (113 ICC: 29 mIDH1 and 84 IDH wild-type), all IDH1-mutant tumors were of small duct-type histology, thus analysis was limited to 101 small duct-type tumors. mIDH1cases were more likely to have plump cuboidal/polygonal shape (P = .014) and geographic-type fibrosis (P = .005), while IDH1 wild-type were more likely to have low cuboidal shape (P = .005). Both groups were predominantly architecturally heterogeneous with no significant difference in the distribution of architectural patterns. Plump cuboidal/polygonal cell shape and a geographic-type pattern of intra-tumoral fibrosis are more often seen in mIDH1compared to IDH wild-type tumors; however, IDH1 mutation is not associated with a distinct histoarchitectural pattern.

Dramatic response of FOLFIRINOX regimen in a collision pancreatic adenocarcinoma patient with a germline BRCA2 mutation: a case report.||||||||Germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are the most common gene mutations in familial pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Several reports have demonstrated the utility of platinum-based chemotherapy for treating cancer patients who harbour a BRCA mutation. Here we discuss a 47-year-old Japanese female with no relevant past history who presented with epigastralgia and fever in September 2016. A computed tomography scan revealed a low-density, low-enhanced tumour 15 mm in diameter in the head of the pancreas. The pathological diagnosis was a ductal pancreatic carcinoma. A 6 mm low-enhanced metastatic tumour was also detected in segment 4 of the liver. Because she had early onset of the disease and a family history-her mother died of pancreatic adenocarcinoma at age 48-we considered a diagnosis of familial pancreatic adenocarcinoma. She received modified FOLFIRINOX. Two months after starting chemotherapy, she was diagnosed with an invasive ductal carcinoma in the right breast. FOLFIRINOX was continued for 8 cycles (4 months); the primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma shrank and the liver metastatic foci disappeared, but the size of the breast tumour increased. Total right breast excision and sentinel lymph node dissection were performed. FOLFIRINOX was continued and after 12 cycles (6 months), both her pancreatic adenocarcinoma and liver metastasis were no longer visible using imaging. Pancreatoduodenectomy was performed and the primary tumour had shrunk to 2.5 mm. Genetic testing revealed a germline BRCA2 mutation. The FOLFIRINOX regimen showed dramatic effects on the collision pancreatic but not on the breast cancer.

Recommendations for Preventive Care for Women with Rare Genetic Cause of Breast and Ovarian Cancer.||||||||An inherited predisposition to breast cancer underlies 5-10% of breast tumors. High-risk BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes result in an 85% lifetime risk of breast cancer and a 20-60% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer. Next-generation sequencing or massive parallel sequencing are now established testing methods that enable screening for many genes that predispose to heterogeneous hereditary cancer syndromes (22 genes are required by the health insurance companies). In addition to BRCA1 and BRCA2, inherited mutations in other genes predispose to breast and/or ovarian cancer. High-risk breast cancer genes include TP53, STK11, CDH1, PTEN, PALB2, and NF1, while moderate-risk (2-4 times increased risk) breast cancer genes include ATM, CHEK2, and NBN. Moderate risk is also suggested for Lynch syndrome, MUTYH, BRIP1, RAD51C, RAD51D, BARD1, FANCA, FANCC, FANCM, BLM, WRN genes. In heterozygotes for other recessive syndromes the risk of developing breast cancer is subject to current research. Low-risk genes are (mostly) irrelevant from a clinical perspective. Other genes that increase the risk of ovarian cancer include the genes for Lynch syndrome, the BRIP1, RAD51C and RAD51D genes. Preventive care should be proposed based on assumed cumulative breast cancer risk (see http: //www.mamo.cz): a risk of &gt;20% for BRCA1/2, TP53, PTEN, STK11, CDH1, PALB2, CHEK2, ATM, and NF1; and a risk of 10-20% for BRIP1, RAD51C, RAD51B, BARD1, FANCA, FANCC, FANCM, NBN, BLM, and WRN. The genetic risk should be assessed by a geneticist and be based on inherited mutations and empirical risk according to family history. Prophylactic mastectomy is considered for high-risk gene carriers but not for moderate-risk gene carriers; however, it may be considered if there is an underlying family history, a risk of parenchyma of the mammary gland, or other risk factors. Ovarian cancer risk increases significantly in carriers of the BRIP1, RAD51C, and RAD51D genes. For prevention of ovarian cancer, prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy is an important component of preventive care. In ovarian cancer families with no identified risk germline mutation, preventive salpingo-oophorectomy is not routinely recommended but may be considered as the only efficient method of prevention due to the increased empirical risk (4 times) of ovarian cancer in first-degree relatives.

Novel solute carrier family 26, member 3 mutation in a prenatal recurrent case with congenital chloride diarrhea.||||||||Congenital chloride diarrhea (CCD) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease manifested by persistent, watery, profuse diarrhea with high chloride concentration (>90 mmol/L). Postnatally, neonates suffer from hypochloremia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, dehydration, developmental retardation, or even death. Prenatal diagnosis is of great importance for the prognosis of CCD. We report a prenatal recurrent case of CCD. Prenatal ultrasound revealed fetal diffuse intestinal dilation with the typical honeycomb sign and polyhydramnios with high amniotic fluid index. The whole exome capture and massively-parallel DNA sequencing showed an abnormal mutation of Solute Carrier Family 26, Member 3 (SLC26A3), c.1039G>A (p.Ala347Thr), and the mutation sites were verified by sanger sequencing. When prenatal ultrasound shows polyhydramnios and diffuse intestinal dilation, CCD should be suspected. Molecular genetic testing can be helpful for the diagnosis.

MYD88 mutations identify a molecular subgroup of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with an unfavourable prognosis.||||||||The 2016 WHO classification defines diffuse large B-cell lymphoma subtypes based on EBV infection and oncogenic rearrangements of MYC/BCL2/BCL6 as drivers of lymphomagenesis. A subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, however, is characterized by activating mutations in MYD88/CD79B. We investigated whether MYD88/CD79B mutations could improve the classification and prognostication of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. In 250 primary diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, MYD88/CD79B mutations were identified by allele-specific PCR or next-generation-sequencing, MYC/BCL2/BCL6 rearrangements were analyzed by FISH, and EBV was studied by EBER-ISH. Associations of molecular features with clinicopathologic characteristics, outcome, and prognosis according to International Prognostic Index were investigated. MYD88 and CD79B mutations were identified in 29.6% and 12.3%, , MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements in 10.6%, 13.6%, and 20.3%, and EBV in 11.7% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, respectively. Prominent mutual exclusivity between EBV positivity, rearrangements, and MYD88/CD79B mutations established the value of molecular markers for recognition of biologically distinct diffuse large B-cell lymphoma subtypes. MYD88-mutated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma had a significantly inferior 5-year overall survival than wild-type MYD88 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (log-rank;P=0.019). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma without any of the studied aberrations had superior overall survival compared to cases carrying ≥1 aberrancy (log-rank;P=0.010). MYD88 mutations retained their adverse prognostic impact upon adjustment for other genetic and clinical variables by multivariable analysis and improved the prognostic performance of the International Prognostic Index. This study demonstrates the clinical utility of defining MYD88-mutated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma as a distinct molecular subtype with adverse prognosis. Our data call for sequence analysis of MYD88 in routine diagnostics of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma to optimize classification and prognostication, and to guide the development of improved treatment strategies.

A mutation analysis of the EGFR pathway genes, RAS, EGFR, PIK3CA, AKT1 and BRAF, and TP53 gene in thymic carcinoma and thymoma type A/B3.||||||||Thymic carcinoma is rare and usually has a fatal outcome. Gene mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling pathway and TP53 have not been well analysed in thymic carcinoma.||||We examined a large cohort of thymic carcinoma and thymoma type A/B3 and looked for gene mutations in the RAS family, EGFR, PIK3CA, AKT1, BRAF and TP53. Among 54 thymic carcinoma cases, RAS family mutations were detected in 10 cases, EGFR in two, PIK3CA in one, AKT1 in one, BRAF in none and TP53 in five. Among 33 thymoma type A/B3 cases, HRAS gene mutation were found in one, PIK3CA in two and AKT1 in one. All these mutations were those of missense type activating mutations. RAS family mutations were significantly more frequent in thymic carcinoma than in thymoma type A/B3 (P = 0.0461). A prognostic analysis focusing on thymic squamous cell carcinoma cases (n = 44) showed that the overall survival was significantly shorter in patients with EGFR pathway mutations (n = 9) than in those without in a univariate analysis (P = 0.0173). Subsequently, EGFR pathway mutations were selected as an independent factor for a poor overall survival in a multivariate analysis (P = 0.0389).||||Mutations in the EGFR pathway and TP53 in thymic carcinoma may be frequent, and the EGFR pathway mutations may be associated with a poor prognosis in thymic squamous cell carcinoma patients.

A drug-drug interaction study to assess the potential effect of acid-reducing agent, lansoprazole, on quizartinib pharmacokinetics.||||||||Quizartinib, a potent, selective FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor, is currently in phase 3 development for patients with FLT3-internal tandem duplication-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Acid-reducing agents (ARAs; e.g., proton pump inhibitors) are frequently used during AML treatment. Since quizartinib demonstrates pH-dependent solubility, the effect of lansoprazole coadministration on pharmacokinetics (PK) of quizartinib tablet formulation was assessed.||||An open-label, parallel-group study randomized 64 healthy adults to single-dose quizartinib 30 mg alone (reference) or lansoprazole (60 mg once daily, days 1-5) + single-dose quizartinib 30 mg (day 5) (test). Plasma concentrations of quizartinib and its active metabolite, AC886, were measured to 504 h postdose; the effect of lansoprazole on quizartinib PK was assessed by analysis of variance.|||| just below 80-125% limits. Treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate; the most frequent in either treatment group were headache [quizartinib alone: (n = 3) 10%], upper respiratory tract infection [quizartinib alone: (n = 2) 6.7%; lansoprazole + quizartinib: (n = 3) 9.1%], and muscle tightness [quizartinib alone: (n = 2) 6.7%].||||Concomitant lansoprazole had minimal effect on quizartinib PK as a formulated tablet, indicating that quizartinib can be administered with ARAs.

An LTR retrotransposon-derived lncRNA interacts with RNF169 to promote homologous recombination.||||||||LTR retrotransposons are abundant repetitive elements in the human genome, but their functions remain poorly understood. Here, we report the function and regulatory mechanism of an ERV-9 LTR retrotransposon-derived lncRNA called p53-regulated lncRNA for homologous recombination (HR) repair 1 (PRLH1) in human cells. PRLH1 is highly expressed in p53-mutated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples and promotes cell proliferation in p53-mutated HCC cells, and its transcription is promoted by NF-Y and suppressed by p53. Mechanistically, PRLH1 specifically binds to an uncharacterized domain of RNF169 through two GCUUCA boxes in its 5' terminal region to form a DNA repair complex that supplants 53BP1 at double-strand break (DSB) sites and then promotes the initiation of HR repair. Notably, PRLH1 is essential for the stabilization of RNF169, acting as an RNA platform to recruit and assemble HR protein factors. This study characterizes PRLH1 as a novel HR-promoting factor and provides new insights into the function and mechanism of LTR retrotransposon-derived lncRNAs.

Genotype/phenotype correlations of childhood-onset congenital sideroblastic anaemia in a European cohort.||||||||Congenital sideroblastic anaemia (CSA) is a rare disease caused by germline mutations of genes involved in haem and iron-sulphur cluster formation, and mitochondrial protein biosynthesis. We performed a retrospective multicentre European study of a cohort of childhood-onset CSA patients to explore genotype/phenotype correlations. We studied 23 females and 20 males with symptoms of CSA. Among the patients, the most frequently mutated genes were ALAS2 (n = 10; 23·3%) and SLC25A38 (n = 8; 18·6%), causing isolated forms of microcytic anaemia of varying severity. Five patients with SLC19A2 mutations suffered from thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia and three exhibited the 'anaemia, deafness and diabetes' triad. Three patients with TRNT1 mutations exhibited severe early onset microcytic anaemia associated with thrombocytosis, and two exhibited B-cell immunodeficiency, inflammatory syndrome and psychomotor delay. The prognoses of patients with TRNT1 and SLC2A38 mutations were generally dismal because of comorbidities or severe iron overload. No molecular diagnosis could be established in 14/43 cases. This study emphasizes the frequency of ALAS2 and SLC25A38 mutations and provides the largest comprehensive analysis to date of genotype/phenotype correlations in CSA. Further studies of CSA patients with data recorded in an international registry would be helpful to improve patient management and establish standardized guidelines.

Atm gene mutations increase female reproductive cancer risk. Phosphoramide mustard (PM) induces ovarian DNA damage and destroys primordial follicles, and pharmacological ATM inhibition prevents PM-induced follicular depletion. Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 or Atm+/- mice were dosed once intraperitoneally with sesame oil (95%) or PM (25 mg/kg) in the proestrus phase of the estrous cycle and ovaries harvested 3 days thereafter. Atm+/- mice spent ~ 25% more time in diestrus phase than WT. LC-MS/MS on ovarian protein was performed and bioinformatically analyzed. Relative to WT, Atm+/- mice had 64 and 243 proteins increased or decreased in abundance, respectively. In WT mice, PM increased 162 and decreased 20 proteins. In Atm+/- mice, 173 and 37 proteins were increased and decreased, respectively, by PM. Exportin-2 (XPO2) was localized to granulosa cells of all follicle stages and was 7.2-fold greater in Atm+/- than WT mice. Cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 1 (CYFIP1) was 6.8-fold lower in Atm+/- mice and was located in the surface epithelium with apparent translocation to the ovarian medulla post-PM exposure. PM induced γH2AX, but fewer γH2AX positive foci were identified in Atm+/- ovaries. Similarly, cleaved caspase-3 was lower in the Atm+/- PM-treated, relative to WT mice. These findings support ATM involvement in ovarian DNA repair and suggest that ATM functions to regulate ovarian atresia.

A comprehensive analysis of NPHS1 gene mutations in patients with sporadic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.||||||||Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is still one of the common causes of refractory nephrotic syndrome. Nephrin, encoded by podocyte-specific NPHS1 gene, participated in the pathogenesis of FSGS. The sites of NPHS1 mutations in FSGS is not clarified very well. In this study, we investigated the specific mutations of NPHS1 gene in Chinese patients with sporadic FSGS.||||A total of 309 patients with sporadic FSGS were collected and screened for NPHS1 mutations by second-generation sequencing. The variants were compared with those extracted from 2504 healthy controls in the 1000 Genomes Project. The possible pathogenic roles of missense variants were predicted by three different software. We also compared these candidate causal mutations with those summarized from the previous studies.||||Thirty-two genetic mutations of NPHS1 gene were identified in FSGS patients, including 12 synonymous mutations, 17 missense mutations, 1 splicing mutation, and 2 intron mutations, of which c.G3315A (p.S1105S) was the most common variant (261/309). A novel missense mutation c.G2638 T (p.V880F) and a novel splicing mutation 35830957 C > T were identified in FSGS patients. The frequencies of the four synonymous mutations (c.C294T [p.I98I], c.C2223T [p.T741 T], c.C2289T [p.V763 V], c.G3315A [p.S1105S]) were much higher in FSGS patients than in controls.

Integrated Analysis of TP53 Gene and Pathway Alterations in The Cancer Genome Atlas.||||||||The TP53 tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated in human cancers. An analysis of five data platforms in 10,225 patient samples from 32 cancers reported by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) enables comprehensive assessment of p53 pathway involvement in these cancers. More than 91% of TP53-mutant cancers exhibit second allele loss by mutation, chromosomal deletion, or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. TP53 mutations are associated with enhanced chromosomal instability, including increased amplification of oncogenes and deep deletion of tumor suppressor genes. Tumors with TP53 mutations differ from their non-mutated counterparts in RNA, miRNA, and protein expression patterns, with mutant TP53 tumors displaying enhanced expression of cell cycle progression genes and proteins. A mutant TP53 RNA expression signature shows significant correlation with reduced survival in 11 cancer types. Thus, TP53 mutation has profound effects on tumor cell genomic structure, expression, and clinical outlook.

No additional homozygotes for this rare allele, which leads to amino acid substitution T94M, were present among the unaffected relatives tested or in the 60,000 exomes of the ExAC database. For axons to survive, axonal NMNAT2 activity has to be maintained above a threshold level but the T94M mutation confers a partial loss of function both in the ability of NMNAT2 to support axon survival and in its enzymatic properties. Electrophysiological tests and histological analysis of sural nerve biopsies in the patients were consistent with loss of distal sensory and motor axons. Thus, it is likely that NMNAT2 mutation causes this pain and axon loss phenotype making this the first disorder associated with mutation of a key regulator of Wallerian-like axon degeneration in humans. This supports indications from numerous animal studies that the Wallerian degeneration pathway is important in human disease and raises important questions about which other human phenotypes could be linked to this gene.

Novel STAG3 mutations in a Caucasian family with primary ovarian insufficiency.||||||||Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) affects ~ 1-3, 7% of women under forty and is a public health problem. Most causes are unknown, but an increasing number of genetic causes have been identified recently. The identification of such causes is essential for genetic and therapeutic counseling in patients and their families. We performed whole exome sequencing in two Caucasian sisters displaying non syndromic POI and their unaffected mother. We identified two novel pathogenic variants in STAG3 encoding a meiosis-specific subunit of the cohesin ring, which ensures correct sister chromatid cohesion: a c.3052delC truncating mutation in exon 28 yielding p.Arg1018Aspfs*14, and a c.659T > G substitution in exon seven yielding p.Leu220Arg. Leu220, highly conserved throughout species, belongs to the STAG domain conserved with other mitotic subunits of the cohesion complex STAG1 and 2. In silico analysis reveals that this substitution markedly impacts the structure of this domain. The truncation removes the last 206 C-terminal residues, not conserved in STAG1 and 2, supporting an important specific role in STAG3, especially meiosis. This is the first occurrence of STAG3 mutations in a Caucasian family. Very little is known about the function of STAG proteins domains. The "knock out-like" phenotype described here supports the crucial role of a single residue in the STAG domain and of the C-terminal region in STAG3 function. In conclusion, this observation shows the necessity to perform the genetic study of POI worldwide including STAG3. This could lead to appropriate genetic counseling and long term follow-up since these patients may develop ovarian tumors.

TET2, a member of this family, is frequently mutated in hematological disorders. The contributions of TET2 in hematopoiesis have been attributed to its DNA demethylase activity, and the significance of its nonenzymatic functions has remained undefined. To dissect the catalytic and non-catalytic requirements of Tet2, we engineered catalytically inactive Tet2 mutant mice and conducted comparative analyses of Tet2 mutant and Tet2 knockout animals. Tet2 knockout mice exhibited expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and developed myeloid and lymphoid disorders, while Tet2 mutant mice predominantly developed myeloid malignancies reminiscent of human myelodysplastic syndromes. HSPCs from Tet2 knockout mice exhibited distinct gene expression profiles, including downregulation of Gata2. Overexpression of Gata2 in Tet2 knockout bone marrow cells ameliorated disease phenotypes. Our results reveal the non-catalytic roles of TET2 in HSPC homeostasis.

[Analysis of FBN1 gene mutations in two pedigrees affected with Marfan syndrome].||||||||To detect mutations of fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene in two pedigrees affected with Marfan syndrome (MFS).||||Peripheral blood samples were collected from MFS patients and their healthy family members for extracting genomic DNA. All of the 65 exons of the FBN1 gene were analyzed by next-generation sequencing. PolyPhen-2 and SIFT was used to predict structural and functional changes in FBN1 protein.||||Patients from both pedigrees presented ocular and skeletal manifestations suggestive of MFS. Two novel heterozygous mutations of the FBN1 gene, including c.1879C>T (p.R627C) in exon 16 and c.2584T>C (p.C862R) in exon 22, were identified. The same mutations were not found among unaffected members. By bioinformatic analysis, the mutations may affect the structure and function of the FBN1 protein.||||The c.1879C>T and c.2584T>C mutations of the FBN1 gene probably account for the disease in the two pedigrees, respectively. Identification of the c.2584T>C has enriched the spectrum of FBN1 gene mutations.

HER2 somatic mutation analysis in breast cancer: correlation with clinicopathological features.||||||||HER2 mutations have been reported in approximately 2% of breast cancers. Regardless of HER2 overexpression or amplification status, breast cancer with HER2 mutations may respond to HER2-targeted therapy. As HER2 mutation is rare, the clinical and pathological features of HER2-mutated breast cancers, such as hormonal status, histological grade, and metastasis, remain poorly defined. Therefore, the identification of HER2-mutated breast cancer has clinical significance. We retrospectively screened patients with metastatic breast cancer in whom molecular profiling had been performed using next-generation sequencing from 2012 to 2015; we identified 18 patients with HER2 mutation. Mutations were found on next-generation sequencing-based panels, including Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot, Oncomine, FoundationOne, and Guardant360. HER2 mutations were identified in both the tyrosine kinase (n = 14) and extracellular (n = 4) domains. Of the 14 cases with tyrosine kinase domain mutations, 13 were estrogen receptor positive; the 4 cases with extracellular domain mutations were exclusively estrogen receptor negative. In addition, 11 of 14 patients with tyrosine kinase domain mutations had bone metastasis, whereas no patients with HER2 extracellular domain mutations had bone metastasis. Histologically, 13 patients had invasive ductal carcinoma, 1 had metaplastic carcinoma, and 4 had invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). All 4 ILCs were high grade and pleomorphic, and not only had an HER2 mutation in the kinase domain but also had an HER2 mutation involving the L755 site. Specific mutation sites may be involved in the pathogenesis of nonclassic ILC.

Recurrent mutations in BRCC3 have been reported in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) but not in de novo AML. In one of our recent studies, we found BRCC3 mutations selectively in 9/191 (4.7%) cases with t(8;21)(q22;q22.1) AML but not in 160 cases of inv(16)(p13.1q22) AML. Clinically, AML patients with BRCC3 mutations had an excellent outcome with an event-free survival of 100%. Inactivation of BRCC3 by CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in improved proliferation in t(8;21)(q22;q22.1) positive AML cell lines and together with expression of AML1-ETO induced unlimited self-renewal in mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro. Mutations in BRCC3 abrogated its deubiquitinating activity on IFNAR1 resulting in an impaired interferon response and led to diminished inflammasome activity. In addition, BRCC3 inactivation increased release of several cytokines including G-CSF which enhanced proliferation of AML cell lines with t(8;21)(q22;q22.1). Cell lines and primary mouse cells with inactivation of BRCC3 had a higher sensitivity to doxorubicin due to an impaired DNA damage response providing a possible explanation for the favorable outcome of BRCC3 mutated AML patients.

Novel variant p.E269K confirms causative role of PLS1 mutations in autosomal dominant hearing loss.||||||||Auditory reception relies on the perception of mechanical stimuli by stereocilia and its conversion to electrochemical signal. Mechanosensory stereocilia are abundant in actin, which provides them with structural conformity necessary for perception of auditory stimuli. Out of three major classes of actin-bundling proteins, plastin 1 encoded by PLS1, is highly expressed in stereocilia and is necessary for their regular maintenance. A missense PLS1 variant associated with autosomal dominant hearing loss (HL) in a small family has recently been reported. Here, we present another PLS1 missense variant, c.805G > A (p.E269K), in a Turkish family with autosomal dominant non-syndromic HL confirming the causative role of PLS1 mutations in HL. We propose that HL due to the p.E269K variant is from the loss of a stable PLS1-ACTB interaction.

MYH7 Gene-Related Mutation p.V878L Identified in a Chinese Family with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.||||||||Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most common inherited cardiovascular diseases and possesses a high risk for sudden cardiac death. Although mutations in more than 20 genes have been reported to be associated with HCM thus far, the genetic backgrounds of most HCM patients are not fully understood. We performed a genetic analysis in a Chinese family that presented with HCM using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Clinical data, family histories, and blood samples were collected from the proband and family members. Five patients showed typical clinical symptoms of HCM. One subject was the victim of sudden cardiac death. By NGS, we determined that these subjects with HCM symptoms carried a missense heterozygous genetic mutation c.2632C>A (p.V878L) in the myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7) gene with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Individuals without this mutation showed no symptoms or cardiac structural abnormalities related to HCM. Bioinformatics evaluation predicted this mutant as "damaging" and "disease causing". Additionally, sequence alignment showed that this mutant is located in an evolutionarily conserved region of MYH7 in multiple species. Our results describe a potentially pathogenic mutation associated with HCM, which may extend the spectrum of HCM phenotypes related to MYH7 gene mutations.

Invasive coronary angiography findings across the CAD-RADS classification spectrum.||||||||The recently introduced coronary artery disease reporting and data system (CAD-RADS) evaluated by computed tomography and based on stenosis severity, might not adequately reflect the complexity of CAD. We explored the relationship between CAD-RADS and the spatial distribution, burden, and complexity of lesions by invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Stable patients who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and ICA comprised the study population. Patients were classified according to the CAD-RADS: 0, No plaque; 1, 1-24% stenosis; 2, 25-49%; 3, 50-69%; 4A, 70-99%; 4B, left main stenosis or 3-vessel obstructive disease; and 5, total occlusion. Based on ICA findings, we calculated the SYNTAX score and the CAD extension index. Ninety-one patients were included, with a mean age of 61.4 ± 10.5 years (74% male). We found significant relationships between CAD-RADS and both the SYNTAX score (p < 0.0001) and the CAD extension index (p < 0.0001), although the complexity of coronary anatomy differed among patients with CAD-RADS ≥ 4A. Among patients with CAD-RADS < 4, the mean segment involvement score (SIS) was 8.4 ± 4.0, 52% of them with a SIS > 5. Of the 30 patients with CAD-RADS 5, 9 (30%) affected distal segments or secondary branches, and 9 (30%) had concomitant severe non-extensive disease at ICA. Regarding the spatial distribution of the non-occluded most severe lesions, 27 (44%) comprised distal segments or secondary branches. In the present study including a high-risk population, we identified diverse coronary anatomy complexity scenarios and relevant differences in spatial distribution sharing the same CAD-RADS classification.

GRK2 promotes growth of medulloblastoma cells and protects them from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.||||||||G-protein coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2; ADRBK1, BARK1) is most known as a regulator of G-protein coupled receptors. However, GRK2 also has other functions. Medulloblastomas are the most common malignant brain cancers in children. GRK2 has not been implicated in medulloblastoma biology. Here we report that GRK2 knockdown slowed cell growth, diminished proliferation, and enhanced cisplatin- and etoposide-induced apoptosis in medulloblastoma cell lines UW228-2 and Daoy. Reciprocally, GRK2 overexpression attenuated apoptosis induced by these chemotherapy drugs. Cisplatin and etoposide increased phosphorylation of AKT (S473) and GRK2 knockdown mitigated this increase. Cisplatin and etoposide attenuated ERK phosphorylation, but GRK2 knockdown did not alter this effect. Wildtype GRK2 reversed the increase in cisplatin- and etoposide-induced apoptosis caused by GRK2 knockdown. GRK2-K220R (kinase dead) and GRK2-S670A (unphosphorylated, constitutively active) conferred protection from cisplatin that was similar to wildtype GRK2, suggesting that this protection may be mediated though a kinase-independent activity of GRK2. These data demonstrate that GRK2 contributes to proliferation and survival of these medulloblastoma cell lines and to their protection from cisplatin- and etoposide-induced apoptosis.

The present study aims to confirm the therapeutic potential of EZH2 inhibitors and investigate the molecular mechanisms of DZNep in chondrosarcomas.||||CS cell lines and primary cultures were used. Apoptosis was investigated using PARP cleavage, caspase 3/7 activity, or Apo2.7 expression. S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) were quantified by UHPLC-MS/MS. Differentially expressed genes in treated-chondrosarcomas and chondrocytes were researched by microarray analysis.||||DZNep induced apoptosis in chondrosarcomas both in vivo and in vitro. However, this effect was not correlated to EZH2 expression nor activity, and EZH2 knock-down by siRNA did not reduce CS viability. Additionally, the reduction of H3K27me3 induced by GSK126 or tazemetostat (EPZ-6438) did not provoke chondrosarcoma death. However, as expected, DZNep induced SAH accumulation and reduced SAM:SAH ratio. Further, microarray analysis suggests a key role of EGFR in antitumoral effect of DZNep, and pharmacological inhibition of EGFR reduced chondrosarcoma survival.||||EZH2 is not an adequate target for chondrosarcoma treatment. However, DZNep induces apoptosis in chondrosarcomas in vitro and in vivo, by a mechanism likely mediated though EGFR expression. Consequently, it would be worth initiating clinical trials to evaluating efficiency to S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase or EGFR inhibitors in patients with chondrosarcomas.

SERPINA1 and HSD17B13 Gene Variants in Patients with Liver Fibrosis and Cirrhosis.||||||||Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SERPINA1 (Pi*Z rs28929474 and Pi*S rs17580) are risk factors for developing liver cirrhosis. A recent study identified a common SNP in HSD17B13 (rs72613567) that conferred protection from chronic liver disease. The aim of the present study was to test these associations in a cohort of Lithuanian patients with liver fibrosis or cirrhosis.||||The study included 302 patients with cirrhosis, 127 patients with liver fibrosis (METAVIR stages I-III) and 548 controls, all from Lithuania. SNPs were genotyped by quantitative PCR, using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. Adjusted p value of ≤ 0.016 was considered significant.||||Genotype distributions of SERPINA1 and HSD17B13 SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. SERPINA1 Pi*Z was not associated with liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. HSD17B13 rs10433937 (in high linkage disequilibrium with rs72613567; r 2 =0.96) also showed no overall association with liver disease, but the GG- genotype was associated with reduced risk of liver fibrosis (aOR 0.37, p=0.03). SERPINA1 Pi*S was associated with higher risk of developing hepatic fibrosis (aOR 3.42, p=0.001) and cirrhosis (aOR 2.59, p=0.02).||||We found that SERPINA1 Pi*S variant conferred an increased risk of developing liver fibrosis, while SERPINA1 Pi*Z and HSD17B13 rs10433937 were not associated with liver fibrosis or cirrhosis of different aetiology.

FGFR4 does not contribute to progression of chronic kidney disease.||||||||In chronic kidney disease (CKD), elevated serum levels of the phosphate regulating hormone fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 have emerged as powerful risk factors for cardiovascular disease and death. Mechanistically, FGF23 can bind and activate fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 4 independently of α-klotho, the canonical co-receptor for FGF23 in the kidney, which stimulates left ventricular hypertrophy and hepatic production of inflammatory cytokines. FGF23 has also been shown to independently predict progression of renal disease, however, whether FGF23 and FGFR4 also contribute to CKD remains unknown. Here, we generated a mouse model with dual deletions of FGFR4 and α-klotho, and we induced CKD in mice with either global deletion or constitutive activation of FGFR4. We demonstrate that FGF23 is not capable of inducing phosphaturia via FGFR4 and that FGFR4 does not promote or mitigate renal injury in animal models of CKD. Taken together our results suggest FGFR4 inhibition as a safe alternative strategy to target cardiovascular disease and chronic inflammation in patients with CKD without interrupting the necessary phosphaturic effects of FGF23.

Plasma Free Protein S Is Correlated with Disease Activity, but not with Subclinical Atherosclerosis among Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: A Cross-Sectional Study.||||||||A defect in clearance of apoptotic materials is pivotal in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Protein S participates in the removal of apoptotic remnants and the anticoagulation pathway. The aim of the study was to clarify the relationship between plasma levels of free protein S and the disease activity or subclinical atherosclerosis in SLE. Free protein S was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and patients were classified into two groups of free protein S levels: low (< 50%) and normal (≥ 50%). One hundred-eleven Korean female patients with SLE were enrolled, and the levels of free protein S were 67.4 ± 19.7%. Carotid plaque was detected in 25 (22.5%) patients. Twenty-one patients with low free protein S had lower hemoglobin (11.4 ± 1.4 vs. 12.5 ± 1.4 g/dL) and lymphocytes (1,221 ± 609 vs. 1,720 ± 1,097/µL), higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (30.1 ± 20.6 vs. 20.8 ± 17.8 mm/h), and lower complement 3 (80.8 ± 27.6 vs. 103.4 ± 25.8 mg/dL) and complement 4 (15.6 ± 10.4 vs. 21.5 ± 7.6 mg/dL) than those with normal protein S. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with increased carotid artery intima-media thickness (> 4.6 mm) or with carotid artery plaque between two groups. The low levels of free protein S were associated with hemoglobin (OR = 0.64, p = 0.04) and complement 3 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005). Free protein S is correlated with disease activity, but not with subclinical atherosclerosis in SLE.

The incidence and relative risk of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors-related colitis in non-small cell lung cancer: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.||||||||The programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) inhibitors have shown encouraging merits in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, however, they are often related to potentially fatal immune-related adverse events (irAEs) including colitis. Considering the incidence and characteristics of immune-related colitis may have significant implications for the appropriate utilization of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in clinical practice, we conduct this meta to systematically analyze the correlation between PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for the treatment of NSCLC and the incidence of immune-associated colitis.||||Electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov/) were searched up to May 2019, clinical trials reporting all grade (1-5), higher grade (3-5) colitis and grade 3-5 diarrhea were included, data were expressed as relative risk (RR), incidence, corresponding p value and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).||||9 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified (7 with PD-1 inhibitors [n = 4526]) and 2 with PD-L1 inhibitors [n = 1464]). The overall incidence of PD-1/PD-L1 target agents was 1.40% for all grade colitis, 0.89% for severe colitis, 11.62% for all grade diarrhea and 1.36% for severe diarrhea. Compared with chemotherapy group, the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors had a significantly higher risk of all grade (RR: 3.68, p < 0.001) and high-grade (RR: 2.97, p = 0.01) colitis. Additional analysis of relative risk of diarrhea revealed that PD-1/PD-L1 treatment moderately reduce the risk of all grade diarrhea (RR: 0.64, p = 0.03), while the difference was not statistically significant in the risk of grade 3-5 diarrhea (RR: 0.83, p = 0.64). Subgroup analyses showed that the RR of all grade and higher grade colitis in PD-1 inhibitors was more significant (RR: 3.56, p = 0.001 vs RR: 2.98, p = 0.02 respectively). However, there was no appreciable difference in PD-L1 inhibitors (RR: 4.75, p = 0.15 vs RR: 2.85, p = 0.52 respectively). When compared with first-line therapy, second-line therapy associated with a higher risk of all grade colitis than first-line therapy (RR: 3.29, p = 0.006; RR: 4.69, p = 0.026).||||Our meta-analysis indicates when compared with control group, the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors may lead to a higher risk of all grade and high grade immune-mediated colitis, but may result in a reduction in all grade diarrhea. PD-1 inhibitors in NSCLC patients, but not PD-L1 inhibitors, increase the risk of all- and high grade colitis. These results suggest that clinicians shall pay more attention to this rare but life-threatening toxic effect.

Anti-tumour necrosis factor-α therapy and recurrent or new primary cancers in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or psoriasis and previous cancer in Denmark: a nationwide, population-based cohort study.||||||||Safety of anti-tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα) therapy in people with a history of cancer and with an immune-mediated disease is unknown. We aimed to assess the risk of recurrence of initial cancer or development of a new primary cancer after treatment with anti-TNFα therapy.||||In this Danish, population-based cohort study we recruited adults (≥18 years) with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis, or psoriasis and a primary cancer diagnosed between Jan 1, 1999 and Dec 31, 2016. Patients were recruited from the prospectively recorded Danish National Patient Registry and the Danish Cancer Registry. Participants were matched 1:10 between the treatment group who received anti-TNFα therapy and the control group (no anti-TNFα therapy) and we excluded individuals with a cancer diagnosed before their first anti-TNFα treatment (or before matching date for controls), individuals diagnosed with IBD, rheumatoid arthritis, or psoriasis after anti-TNFα initiation (or respective match date for controls), and individuals who received anti-TNFα with fewer than five matched controls. Using adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression, we estimated the primary outcome of development of recurrent or new primary cancer in patients who received anti-TNFα therapy compared with patients who did not receive this therapy, matched by sex, immune-mediated disease type, cancer type, and time from initial cancer diagnosis to first anti-TNFα registration.||||Overall, 25 738 patients with immune-mediated disease and a history of cancer were identified. 434 patients who received anti-TNFα therapy after their initial cancer were matched to 4328 patients in the control group. During 18 752 person-years (median 5·6 years [IQR 2·8-7·9]) of follow up, 635 individuals developed recurrent or new primary cancer, 72 of whom had received anti-TNFα therapy and 563 of whom were in the control group. The median time between anti-TNFα treatment and recurrent or new primary cancer diagnosis was 2·8 years (IQR 1·7-5·4). The incidence of recurrent or new primary cancer development was 30·3 cases (95% CI 24·0-38·2) per 1000 person-years in the anti-TNFα treatment group and 34·4 cases (31·7-37·3) per 1000 person-years in the control group, yielding an adjusted hazard ratio of 0·82 (95% CI 0·61-1·11).||||Use of anti-TNFα therapy was not associated with recurrent or new primary cancer development in patients with previous cancer. Timing of anti-TNFα therapy after an initial cancer diagnosis did not influence recurrent or new primary cancer development. This observation might guide clinical decision making among providers treating immune-mediated diseases with anti-TNFα medications.||||None.

Global transcriptomic analysis of the arcuate nucleus following chronic glucocorticoid treatment.||||||||Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely prescribed medications that are well recognized to cause adverse metabolic effects including hyperphagia, obesity, and hyperglycemia. These effects have been recapitulated in a murine model of GC excess, and we hypothesize that they are mediated, in part, through central mechanisms. This study aimed to identify genes in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) that are altered with GC treatment and evaluate their contribution to GC-induced metabolic abnormalities.||||Corticosterone (Cort; 75 μg/ml) was administered in the drinking water to male C57Bl/6J mice for 2 days or 4 weeks. Phenotypic analysis of each group was undertaken and central and peripheral tissues were collected for biochemical and mRNA analyses. Arcuate nuclei were isolated by laser capture microdissection and tissue analyzed by RNA-seq.||||RNA-seq analysis of ARC tissue from 4 week Cort treated mice revealed 21 upregulated and 22 downregulated genes at a time when mice had increased food intake, expansion of adipose tissue mass, and insulin resistance. In comparison, after 2 days Cort treatment, when the main phenotypic change was increased food intake, RNA-seq identified 30 upregulated and 16 downregulated genes. Within the genes altered at 2 days were a range of novel genes but also those known to be regulated by GCs, including Fkbp5, Mt2, Fam107a, as well as some involved in the control of energy balance, such as Agrp, Sepp1, Dio2, and Nmb. Of the candidate genes identified by RNA-seq, type-II iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2) was chosen for further investigation as it was increased (2-fold) with Cort, and has been implicated in the control of energy balance via the modulation of hypothalamic thyroid hormone availability. Targeted knockdown of Dio2 in the MBH using AAV-mediated CRISPR-Cas9 produced a mild attenuation in GC-induced brown adipose tissue weight gain, as well as a 56% reduction in the GC-induced increase in Agrp. However, this conferred no protection from GC-induced hyperphagia, obesity, or hyperglycemia.||||This study identified a comprehensive set of genes altered by GCs in the ARC and enabled the selection of key candidate genes. Targeted knockdown of hypothalamic Dio2 revealed that it did not mediate the chronic GC effects on hyperphagia and hyperglycemia.

Circuit activation was confirmed via an increase in expression of the immediate early gene, c-Fos, within both the hippocampus and the neocortex. We then examined the influence of DREADD-mediated activation of forebrain excitatory neurons on behavioural tests for anxiety and despair-like behaviour. Our results indicate that acute hM3Dq DREADD activation of forebrain excitatory neurons resulted in a significant decline in anxiety-like behaviour on the open field, light-dark avoidance, and the elevated plus maze test. In contrast, hM3Dq DREADD activation of forebrain excitatory neurons did not alter despair-like behaviour on either the tail suspension or forced swim tests. Acute hM4Di DREADD inhibition of CamKIIα-positive forebrain excitatory neurons did not modify either anxiety or despair-like behaviour. Taken together, our results demonstrate that chemogenetic activation of excitatory neurons in the forebrain decreases anxiety-like behaviour in mice.

Positive expressions of ki67, PCNA, and COX-2 in breast cancer patients are not correlated with age, tumor size and clinical stage (P>0.05). There is no significant difference (P>0.05) between the pathological types of breast cancer and positive expressions of ki67, PCNA and COX-2 in all the samples studied. Therefore, there is a correlation between DCE-MRI imaging features and prognostic indicators in breast cancer.

E-cadherin and p120ctn protein expression are lost in hidradenitis suppurativa lesions.||||||||Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease affecting the pilosebaceous units in the axilla, groin and buttocks. While the pathogenesis of HS is not clear, mechanical stress exacerbates HS. In this study, we aimed to determine whether intracellular adhesive junctions may be aberrant in HS patient skin. Strikingly, we observed loss of E-cadherin and p120ctn protein expression, two key adherens junction proteins, in ~85% of HS severe skin lesions. Moreover, loss of protein expression was apparent in non-lesional skin from HS patients and the degree of loss positively correlated with HS Hurley Stage of disease. E-cadherin expression was unaltered in other inflammatory skin conditions including chronic wound epithelium, atopic dermatitis, and acne vulgaris compared with healthy skin suggesting that its loss may be uniquely relevant to HS pathogenesis. A complete loss of α-catenin, β-catenin and ZO-1 was not observed; however, some cytoplasmic staining of the catenins was noted in HS epithelium. We also demonstrated diminished desmosome size in HS lesional skin. Overall, our data suggested that loss of adherens junction proteins and diminished desmosome size in HS skin contributes to the skin's inability to withstand mechanical stress and provides rationale as to why mechanical stress exacerbates HS symptoms.

Identification of new binding proteins of focal adhesion kinase using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry.||||||||Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a 125 kDa protein recruited as a participant in focal adhesion dynamics and serves as a signaling scaffold for the assembly and subsequent maturation of focal contact. Identification of new FAK binding proteins could reveal potential signaling targets and contribute to further development of therapeutic drugs in the treatment of colon cancer. Here, we applied a functional proteomic strategy to identify proteins that interact with FAK in human colon cancer cell line HCT-116. Proteins were targeted by coimmunoprecipitation with an anti-FAK antibody and resolved on 1D-SDS-PAGE. The gel was excised, reduced, alkylated, and trypsin digested. Tryptic peptides were separated by nano-LC-MS/MS by an LTQ-Orbitrap-Velos spectrometer. We identified 101 proteins in the immunocomplex under epithelial growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Three proteins, zyxin, nesprin-1, and desmoplakin, were discovered and validated using reciprocal immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Then, we sought to study the biological relevance of these proteins by siRNA transfection of HCT-116 cells. According to the results, zyxin might play a central role as an upstream regulator to mediate critical cancer-related signaling pathways. Zyxin and nesprin-1 depletion significantly impaired cell migration and invasion capabilities. Additionally, we performed ELISA assays on serum samples from patients with colon cancer instead of cell models to quantify the protein levels of zyxin and nesprin-1. Our results suggested that zyxin and nesprin-1 are not only promising therapeutic targets but also potential diagnostic biomarkers for colon cancer.

Yeast surface display of full-length human microtubule-associated protein tau.||||||||Microtubule-associated protein tau is an intrinsically disordered, highly soluble protein found primarily in neurons. Under normal conditions, tau regulates the stability of axonal microtubules and intracellular vesicle transport. However, in patients of neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau forms neurofibrillary deposits, which correlates well with the disease progression. Identifying molecular signatures in tau, such as posttranslational modification, truncation, and conformational change has great potential to detect earliest signs of neurodegeneration and develop therapeutic strategies. Here, we show that full-length human tau, including the longest isoform found in the adult brain, can be robustly displayed on the surface of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast-displayed tau binds to anti-tau antibodies that cover epitopes ranging from the N-terminus to the 4R repeat region. Unlike tau expressed in the yeast cytosol, surface-displayed tau was not phosphorylated at sites found in AD patients (probed by antibodies AT8, AT270, AT180, and PHF-1). However, yeast-displayed tau showed clear binding to paired helical filament (PHF) tau conformation-specific antibodies Alz-50, MC-1, and Tau-2. Although the tau possessed a conformation found in PHFs, oligomerization or aggregation into larger filaments was undetected. Taken together, yeast-displayed tau enables robust measurement of protein interactions and is of particular interest for characterizing conformational change.

MIF levels were measured in a validation cohort of 84 patients with testicular cancer, 24 with non-malignant testicular tumors and 64 healthy men.||||Serum FGF-2, HGF and PTN levels did not differ in cancer patients and healthy males within the screening cohort, whereas MIF was significantly increased among cancer patients. Within the validation cohort, a modest but insignificant increase of serum MIF was observed in TGCT patients compared to healthy men. MIF levels were not correlated with adverse clinical-pathological parameters.||||FGF-2, HGF, MIF and PTN are not suitable as non-invasive biomarkers for testicular germ cell cancer patients.

Evaluation of a PGP3 ELISA for surveillance of the burden of Chlamydia infection in women from Australia and Samoa.||||||||Serological assays can be used to investigate the population burden of infection and potentially sequelae from Chlamydia. We investigated the PGP3 ELISA as a sero-epidemiological tool for infection or sub-fertility in Australian and Samoan women. The PGP3 ELISA absorbance levels were compared between groups of women with infertility, fertile, and current chlamydial infections. In the Australian groups, women with chlamydial tubal factor infertility had significantly higher absorbance levels in the PGP3 ELISA compared to fertile women (P < 0.0001), but not when compared to women with current chlamydial infection (P = 0.44). In the Samoan study, where the prevalence of chlamydial infections is much higher there were significant differences in the PGP3 ELISA absorbance levels between chlamydial sub-fertile women and fertile women (P = 0.003). There was no difference between chlamydial sub-fertile women and women with a current infection (P = 0.829). The results support that the PGP3 assay is effective for sero-epidemiological analysis of burden of infection, but not for evaluation of chlamydial pathological sequelae such as infertility.

Chromosomal instability suppresses the growth of K-Ras-induced lung adenomas.||||||||Chromosomal instability (CIN) is defined as a high rate of whole chromosome loss or gain and is a hallmark of many aneuploid solid tumors. CIN positively correlates with poor patient prognosis and chemotherapeutic resistance. Despite this clinical importance, the role of CIN in tumor initiation, growth and/or progression remains poorly understood. To date, the only strategies developed to determine how CIN contributes to tumorigenesis have relied on transgenic mouse models that deliberately increase the rate of chromosomal mis-segregation. Here we develop a strain of transgenic mice that is designed to strategically decrease the rate of chromosome mis-segregation and suppress CIN. These animals modestly overexpress the kinesin-13 microtubule depolymerase Kif2b, a strategy proven successful in restoring faithful chromosome segregation to human cancer cells in culture. Using the LA2 K-Ras G12D-induced model for lung cancer, we show that Kif2b expression reduces the number of chromosome segregation defects but does not change the incidence of lung tumor lesions. However, pulmonary tumors were significantly larger in animals expressing Kif2b and those tumors exhibited elevated rates of Ki-67 positive cells relative to controls. Thus, in lung cancers driven by mutations in K-Ras, CIN has little impact on tumor initiation but suppresses tumor growth. These data support a model in which CIN imposes a burden on tumor cells, and that enhancement of mitotic fidelity results in accelerated tumor growth.

BCL-XL and MCL-1 are the key BCL-2 family proteins in melanoma cell survival.||||||||Malignant melanoma is one of the most difficult cancers to treat due to its resistance to chemotherapy. Despite recent successes with BRAF inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors, many patients do not respond or become resistant to these drugs. Hence, alternative treatments are still required. Due to the importance of the BCL-2-regulated apoptosis pathway in cancer development and drug resistance, it is of interest to establish which proteins are most important for melanoma cell survival, though the outcomes of previous studies have been conflicting. To conclusively address this question, we tested a panel of established and early passage patient-derived cell lines against several BH3-mimetic drugs designed to target individual or subsets of pro-survival BCL-2 proteins, alone and in combination, in both 2D and 3D cell cultures. None of the drugs demonstrated significant activity as single agents, though combinations targeting MCL-1 plus BCL-XL, and to a lesser extent BCL-2, showed considerable synergistic killing activity that was elicited via both BAX and BAK. Genetic deletion of BFL-1 in cell lines that express it at relatively high levels only had minor impact on BH3-mimetic drug sensitivity, suggesting it is not a critical pro-survival protein in melanoma. Combinations of MCL-1 inhibitors with BRAF inhibitors also caused only minimal additional melanoma cell killing over each drug alone, whilst combinations with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib was more effective in multiple cell lines. Our data show for the first time that therapies targeting specific combinations of BCL-2 pro-survival proteins, namely MCL-1 plus BCL-XL and MCL-1 plus BCL-2, could have significant benefit for the treatment of melanoma.

The ubiquitination ligase SMURF2 reduces aerobic glycolysis and colorectal cancer cell proliferation by promoting ChREBP ubiquitination and degradation.||||||||The glucose-responsive transcription factor carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) critically promotes aerobic glycolysis and cell proliferation in colorectal cancer cells. It has been reported that ubiquitination may be important in the regulation of ChREBP protein levels and activities. However, the ChREBP-specific E3 ligase and molecular mechanism of ChREBP ubiquitination remains unclear. Using database exploration and expression analysis, we found here that levels of the E3 ligase SMURF2 (Smad-ubiquitination regulatory factor 2) negatively correlate with those of ChREBP in cancer tissues and cell lines. We observed that SMURF2 interacts with ChREBP and promotes ChREBP ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome pathway. Interestingly, ectopic SMURF2 expression not only decreased ChREBP levels but also reduced aerobic glycolysis, increased oxygen consumption, and decreased cell proliferation in colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, SMURF2 knockdown increased aerobic glycolysis, decreased oxygen consumption, and enhanced cell proliferation in these cells, mostly because of increased ChREBP accumulation. Furthermore, we identified Ser/Thr kinase AKT as an upstream suppressor of SMURF2 that protects ChREBP from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Taken together, our results indicate that SMURF2 reduces aerobic glycolysis and cell proliferation by promoting ChREBP ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome pathway in colorectal cancer cells. We conclude that the SMURF2-ChREBP interaction might represent a potential target for managing colorectal cancer.

TLE1 expression fails to distinguish between synovial sarcoma, atypical fibroxanthoma, and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.||||||||Transducin-like enhancer of split 1 (TLE1) belongs to the Groucho/TLE/Grg family. It functions as a transcriptional corepressor and is widely used as a biomarker of synovial sarcoma (SS). Within the skin, atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX) and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) often enter the histopathologic differential diagnosis. TLE1 expression has not been evaluated in these neoplasms. We examined archived tissues sections from the surgical pathology files from 10 adult patients diagnosed with AFX and 10 adult patients diagnosed with DFSP. We found nuclear staining in 10 of 10 AFX and 2 of 10 DFSP. We also noticed three patterns of staining in AFX: predominantly spindle component, predominantly epithelioid component, or mixed pattern of both epithelioid and spindle components. The group with the predominantly spindle pattern expressed the strongest nuclear TLE1 staining. In the DFSP group, one lesion demonstrated staining of epithelioid cells, with strong, diffuse nuclear TLE 1 expression, and the second lesion stained only the spindled cells, with weak nuclear TLE1 marking. In conclusion, TLE1, while a sensitive marker for SS, is not specific. A wide range of cutaneous spindle cell neoplasms also express TLE1. AFX and DFSP should be added to this list. TLE1 might be added to a diagnostic panel in this differential diagnosis.

Characterization of CD44 intracellular domain interaction with RUNX2 in PC3 human prostate cancer cells.||||||||Expression of CD44 receptor is associated with the onset of several tumors. The intracellular domain of CD44 (CD44-ICD) has been implicated as a co-transcription factor for RUNX2 in the regulation of expression of MMP-9 in breast carcinoma cells. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated the role of CD44 in migration and invasion of PC3 prostate cells through activation of MMP-9. CD44 signaling regulates the phosphorylation and hence the localization of RUNX2 in the nucleus. The role of CD44-ICD has not been studied in prostate cancer cells. This study aimed to explore the role of CD44-ICD and RUNX2 in the regulation of expression of metastasis-related genes.||||PC3 and PC3 cells overexpressing RUNX2 protein were analyzed for RUNX2/CD44-ICD interaction by immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and Immunofluorescence analyses. Wound healing and tumorsphere formation analyses were also done in these cells. The real-time PCR analysis was used to detect the expression levels of different genes.||||Expression of CD44 and RUNX2 was observed only in PC3 cells (androgen receptor positive) and not in LNCaP or PCa2b cells (androgen receptor negative). Therefore, CD44-ICD fragment (~ 15-16 kDa) was observed in PC3 cells. Moreover, localization of CD44-ICD was more in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm of PC3 cells. Inhibition of cleavage of CD44 with a γ-secretase inhibitor, DAPT reduced the formation of CD44-ICD; however, accumulation of CD44-external truncation fragments (~ 20 and ~ 25 kDa) was detected. RUNX2 and CD44-ICD interact in the nucleus of PC3 cells, and this interaction was more in PC3 cells transfected with RUNX2 cDNA. Overexpression of RUNX2 augments the expression of metastasis-related genes (e.g., MMP-9 and osteopontin) which resulted in increased migration and tumorsphere formation.||||We have shown here a strong functional relationship between CD44-ICD and RUNX2 in PC3 cells. RUNX2 forms a complex with CD44-ICD as a co-transcriptional factor, and this complex formation not only activates the expression of metastasis-related genes but also contributes to migration and tumorsphere formation. Therefore, RUNX2 and CD44-ICD are potential targets for anti-cancer therapy, and attenuation of their interaction may validate the regulatory effects of these proteins on cancer migration and progression.

PHLPP2 as a novel metastatic and prognostic biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer patients.||||||||PH domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 2 (PHLPP2) has been reported to be a potent tumor suppressor in many human cancers. However, PHLPP2 has not been fully researched as a putative clinical prognostic biomarker of lung cancer.||||The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases including data on 1383 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients were used to determine PHLPP2 expression. PHLPP2 expression was then examined by immunohistochemistry, and its clinical significance analyzed in 134 NSCLC patients, including 73 patients with adenocarcinoma and 81 with squamous cell carcinoma.||||We found PHLPP2 expression to be less pronounced in NSCLC tissue samples than that in nontumoral lung tissues according to data taken from TCGA and GEO datasets; this outcome was further validated by immunohistochemistry assay. The low PHLPP2 expression level was found to be associated with the presence of lymph node metastasis (P = 0.003). Importantly, PHLPP2 was found to be an independent indicator of prognosis for overall (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.520, 95% confidence interval [Cl] = 0.327-0.827; P = 0.006) and disease-free survival (HR = 0.489, 95% Cl = 0.308-0.775; P = 0.002) in patients with surgically-resected NSCLC by multivariate analysis.||||Taken together, our findings show that PHLPP2 is a robust clinical marker for NSCLC survival and could serve as a potential therapeutic target.

Constitutive activation of EGFR is associated with tumor progression and plays a prominent role in malignant phenotype of chondrosarcoma.||||||||Chondrosarcoma is a highly agressive cancer with currently no effective therapies when unresectable or metastasized, thus the outcome remains poor. High-grade chordrosarcomas are resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy and surgical resection remains the only treatment for the majority of chondrosarcomas. Constitutive activation of receptor tyrosine kinases has been shown to be important for malignant transformation and tumour proliferation. Here, we investigated the activation status of EGFR in chondrosarcoma tumor biopsies and cell lines. We found that EGFR is activated in grade II and grade III chondrosarcoma tumors but not in grade I tumors, suggesting a role in tumor progression. Interestingly, we showed that EGFR is activated through an autocrine loop and that inhibition of the EGFR by the TKI, tyrphostin AG1478 or EGFR neutralizing antibodies strongly reduced activation of oncogenic ERK1/2 and mTOR/AKT downstream pathways. Importantly, inhibition of EGFR profoundly reduces cell proliferation and migration, inhibits the expression of MMP13 and MMP3 and enhances cell death. Taken together, these data support the blocking of EGFR as new potential treatment for high-grade chondrosarcoma tumors.

Inhibition of vascular neointima hyperplasia by FGF21 associated with FGFR1/Syk/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in diabetic mice.||||||||Neointima hyperplasia is the pathological basis of atherosclerosis and restenosis, which have been associated with diabetes mellitus (DM). Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a potential diabetic drug, however, it has not been investigated whether FGF21 prevents neointima hyperplasia in DM.||||Vascular neointima hyperplasia was induced in mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) combined with low dose streptozotocin (STZ) administration. In vitro, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were incubated with high glucose (HG, 30 mM). VSMC proliferation and migration, as well as formation of NLRP3 inflammasome, were assessed.||||We found that FGF21 significantly inhibited neointima hyperplasia and improved endothelium-independent contraction in the wire-injured common carotid artery (CCA) of diabetic mice. In vitro, the proliferation and migration of HG-treated VSMCs were shown as remarkable increase of PCNA, cyclin D1, MMP2 and MMP9, as well as cell migration through wound healing and transwell migration assays. Such abnormal changes were dramatically reversed by FGF21, which mimicked the role of NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 and caspase-1 inhibitor WEHD. Moreover, along with more NLRP3, ASC oligomer and their colocalization, the release of active caspase-1(p20) and IL-1β was significantly inhibited by FGF21 in VSMCs exposed to HG. Furthermore, FGF21 suppressed phosphorylation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) via FGFR1, which regulated NLRP3 inflammasome through ASC phosphorylation and oligomerization.||||We demonstrated that potential protection of FGF21 on VSMCs proliferation and migration was associated with inhibition of FGFR1/Syk/NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in the improvement of neointima hyperplasia in diabetic mice.

Effects of Sitagliptin on the Coronary Flow Reserve, Circulating Endothelial Progenitor Cells and Stromal Cell-derived Factor-1alpha.||||||||Objective Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are regulated by stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1α) and are reduced in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). SDF-1α is a substrate of dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4), so we investigated whether or not DPP-4-inhibitors modulate EPC levels in type 2 DM patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods Thirty patients with CAD and type 2 DM treated using an ordinary regimen were enrolled. EPC and SDF-1α levels were compared between those receiving additional 24-week treatment with a DPP-4-inhibitor (n=11) and no additional treatment (n=19). We determined the HbA1c, 1.5-Anhydro-D-glucitol (1,5-AG), coronary flow reserve (CFR), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), E/e', and circulating EPC proportion and SDF-1α levels at baseline and the end of follow-up. The CFR was assessed using a dual-sensor-equipped guidewire. The primary endpoints were changes in the EPC count, SDF-1α levels, and CFR from baseline to the end of follow-up. The secondary endpoints were changes in the HbA1c and 1,5-AG, which are useful clinical markers of postprandial hyperglycemia, as well as the BNP and E/e'. Results After the 6-month follow-up, compared with ordinary regimen subjects, the patients receiving a DPP-4-inhibitor showed no significant increase in the EPC proportion (-0.01±0.50 vs. 0.02±0.77%, p=0.87), SDF-1α level (-600.4±653.6 vs. -283.2±543.1 pg/mL, p=0.18), or CFR (0.0±0.2 vs. 0.1±0.6, p=0.20), whereas both the 1.5-AG level (2.4±4.6 vs. -0.7±2.5 μg/dL, p=0.07) and HbA1c (-0.8±1.8 vs. 0.0±0.7%, p=0.02) were improved. There were no significant differences between the two groups in changes in the BNP and E/e'. Conclusion DPP-4 inhibition with sitagliptin did not increase or decrease the EPC proportion, SDF-1α level, or CFR, although the glycemic control was improved.

In silico evidence of de novo interactions between ribosomal and Epstein - Barr virus proteins.||||||||Association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded latent gene products with host ribosomal proteins (RPs) has not been fully explored, despite their involvement in the aetiology of several human cancers. To gain an insight into their plausible interactions, we employed a computational approach that encompasses structural alignment, gene ontology analysis, pathway analysis, and molecular docking.||||In this study, the alignment analysis based on structural similarity allows the prediction of 48 potential interactions between 27 human RPs and the EBV proteins EBNA1, LMP1, LMP2A, and LMP2B. Gene ontology analysis of the putative protein-protein interactions (PPIs) reveals their probable involvement in RNA binding, ribosome biogenesis, metabolic and biosynthetic processes, and gene regulation. Pathway analysis shows their possible participation in viral infection strategies (viral translation), as well as oncogenesis (Wnt and EGFR signalling pathways). Finally, our molecular docking assay predicts the functional interactions of EBNA1 with four RPs individually: EBNA1-eS10, EBNA1-eS25, EBNA1-uL10 and EBNA1-uL11.||||These interactions have never been revealed previously via either experimental or in silico approach. We envisage that the calculated interactions between the ribosomal and EBV proteins herein would provide a hypothetical model for future experimental studies on the functional relationship between ribosomal proteins and EBV infection.

The lung-enriched p53 mutants V157F and R158L/P regulate a gain of function transcriptome in lung cancer.||||||||Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US, and alterations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are the most frequent somatic mutation among all histologic subtypes of lung cancer. Mutations in TP53 frequently result in a protein that exhibits not only loss of tumor suppressor capability but also gain of oncogenic function (GOF). The canonical p53 hotspot mutants R175H and R273H, for example, confer upon tumors a metastatic phenotype in murine models of mutant p53. To our knowledge, GOF phenotypes of the less often studied V157, R158, and A159 mutants - which occur with higher frequency in lung cancer compared with other solid tumors - have not been defined. In this study, we aimed to define whether the lung mutants are simply equivalent to full loss of the p53 locus, or whether they additionally acquire the ability to drive new downstream effector pathways. Using a publicly available human lung cancer dataset, we characterized patients with V157, R158, and A159 p53 mutations. Additionally, we show here that cell lines with mutant p53-V157F, p53-R158L, and p53-R158P exhibit a loss of expression of canonical wildtype p53 target genes. Furthermore, these lung-enriched p53 mutants regulate genes not previously linked to p53 function including PLAU. Paradoxically, mutant p53 represses genes associated with increased cell viability, migration, and invasion. These findings collectively represent the first demonstration that lung-enriched p53 mutations at V157 and R158 regulate a novel transcriptome in human lung cancer cells and may confer de novo function.

E3 ligase ASB8 promotes porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus proliferation by stabilizing the viral Nsp1α protein and degrading host IKKβ kinase.||||||||Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) can potently suppress type I interferon production and escape from innate immune responses. PRRSV nonstructural protein 1α (Nsp1α) can inhibit IFN-β and NF-κB gene promoter activities, but the precise mechanisms are largely unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that PRRSV Nsp1α interacted with the host E3 ubiquitin ligase ankyrin repeat and SOCS box-containing 8 (ASB8). Specifically, porcine ASB8 promoted K63-linked ubiquitination and increased stability of Nsp1α and boosted PRRSV replication. Moreover, we found that ASB8 was phosphorylated at the N-terminal Ser-31 by host IκB kinase β (IKKβ). In turn, ASB8 facilitated K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of IKKβ via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, resulting in remarkable inhibition of I-kappa-B-alpha (IκBα) and of p65 phosphorylation, consequently suppressing NF-κB activity. Our results provide evidence that PRRSV Nsp1α hijacks up-regulated host ASB8 to escape from intrinsic antiviral immunity.

UCP2 regulates cholangiocarcinoma cell plasticity via mitochondria-to-AMPK signals.||||||||Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is upregulated in several human cancers which contributes to tumorigenesis. However, whether UCP2 expression is amplified in cholangiocarcinoma and whether UCP2 promotes cholangiocarcinoma progression are not known. Our results found that in human cholangiocarcinoma tissues, UCP2 was highly expressed in tumors and its levels were negatively associated with prognosis. Importantly, lymph node invasion of cholangiocarcinoma was associated with higher UCP2 expression. In cholangiocarcinoma cells, cell proliferation and migration were suppressed when UCP2 expression was inhibited via gene knockdown. In UCP2 knockdown cells, glycolysis was inhibited, the mesenchymal markers were downregulated whereas AMPK was activated. The increased mitochondrial ROS and AMP/ATP ratio might be responsible for this activation. When the UCP2 inhibitor genipin was applied, tumor cell migration and 3D growth were suppressed via enhancing the mesenchymal-epithelial transition of cholangiocarcinoma cells. Furthermore, cholangiocarcinoma cells became sensitive to cisplatin and gemcitabine treatments when genipin was applied. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the amplified expression of UCP2 contributes to the progression of cholangiocarcinoma through a glycolysis-mediated mechanism.

Aberrantly elevated Bmi1 promotes cervical cancer tumorigenicity and tumor sphere formation via enhanced transcriptional regulation of Sox2 genes.||||||||The exact molecular mechanisms underlying cervical tumorigenesis are poorly understood. Polycomb complex protein Bmi1 (Bmi1) is involved in the malignant transformation and biological aggressiveness of several human carcinomas. Therefore, the present study assessed the expression of Bmi1 protein in human cervical cancer tissues and examined the mechanisms involved in cervical carcinogenesis. The expression of Bmi1 protein was examined by immunohistochemistry in cervical carcinoma tissues (n=71), high‑grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (n=41) and normal cervical tissues (n=47). Expression of Bmi1 protein gradually increased across samples from the normal cervix (1/47; 2.12%), high‑grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (5/42; 16.13%) and cervical carcinomas (31/71; 43.66%; P<0.05). Additionally, Bmi1 protein expression was associated with tumor histopathological grade. The effects of Bmi1 silencing and overexpression on tumor sphere formation and the tumorigenicity of cervical cancer cells were investigated. Overexpression of Bmi1 resulted in significantly attenuated tumor formation and tumor sphere formation. Consistently, Bmi1 silencing significantly inhibited tumor formation and tumor sphere formation. Furthermore, Bmi1 upregulated the expression of Sox2, and the dual‑luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that Bmi1 transactivated Sox2 by binding to the two E‑box motifs in the Sox2 promoter. In conclusion, aberrantly elevated Bmi1 promotes cervical cancer tumorigenicity and tumor sphere formation via enhanced transcriptional regulation of Sox2 genes as a potential oncogenic factor that participates in the carcinogenesis of cervical carcinomas.

Role of Sphingosine Kinase 1 and Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Axis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.||||||||Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is primarily diagnosed in the latter stages of disease progression and is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Thus, there is a need to find biomarkers of early HCC as well as the development of more effective treatments for the disease. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a pleiotropic lipid signaling molecule produced by two isoforms of sphingosine kinase (SphK1 and SphK2) that is involved in regulation of many aspects of mammalian physiology and pathophysiology, including inflammation, epithelial and endothelial barrier function, cancer, and metastasis, among many others. Abundant evidence indicates that SphK1 and S1P promote cancer progression and metastasis in multiple types of cancers. However, the role of SphK/S1P in HCC is less well studied. Here, we review the current state of knowledge of SphKs and S1P in HCC, including evidence for the correlation of SphK1 expression and S1P levels with progression of HCC and negative outcomes, and discuss how this information could lead to the design of more effective diagnostic and treatment modalities for HCC.

ADAM8 promotes chondrosarcoma cell migration and invasion by activating the NF-κB/MMP-13 signaling axis.||||||||ADAM8 is reported to promote extracellular matrix degradation to provide conditions for tumor metastasis. However, the underlying mechanism of ADAM8 in modulating chondrosarcoma (CHS) metastasis remains unclear. We used two human CHS cell lines SW1353 and HCS-2/8 to analyze the expression profiles of ADAM8 in CHS cells compared with the normal chondrocytes. An important proteolytic enzyme MMP-13 was detected as a marker for extracellular matrix degradation in chondrocytes. Then, by silencing or overexpressing ADAM8, the effects on cell migration and invasion in SW1353 and HCS-2/8, and the downstream signal transduction pathways were evaluated. ADAM8 and MMP-13 were highly expressed, and the NF-κB pathway was activated in SW1353 and HCS-2/8 cells. Silencing ADAM8 significantly reduced the ability of cell migration and invasion, and blocked the NF-κB signaling pathway through IκBα and p65 dephosphorylation, leading to reduced NF-κB transcription activity and decreased MMP-13 expression. ADAM8 overexpression promoted these processes, which, however, were reversed by an inhibitor Bay 11-7085. Our data showed a novel regulation mechanism for ADAM8 in promoting CHS migration and invasion by activating the NF-κB/MMP-13 signaling axis. Modulation of their levels may serve as potential targets in the treatment of CHS and even other cartilage diseases.

In the present study, we found that mRNA and protein expression of ARF3 is up-regulated in breast cancer cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of 167 paraffin-embedded archived breast cancer tissues showed that ARF3 expression was localized primarily in the cytoplasm and was significantly up-regulated in malignant specimens compared to benign specimens. There were strong associations between ARF3 expression and clinicopathological characteristics in breast cancer. We also found that overexpressing ARF3 promoted, while silencing endogenous ARF3 inhibited, the proliferation of breast cancer cells by regulating cell cycle G1-S transition. Moreover, the pro-proliferative effect of ARF3 on breast cancer cells was associated with inactivation of the forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) transcription factor.

Helicobacter pylori inhibits GKN1 expression via the CagA/p-ERK/AUF1 pathway.||||||||Recent studies have shown that gastrokine 1 (GKN1), an important tumor suppressor gene, is downregulated in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infected gastric mucosa and gastric cancer. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Herein, we investigated the potential mechanism of H. pylori-induced GKN1 downregulation.||||GKN1 and AU-rich element RNA-binding factor 1 (AUF1) expressions were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, or immunohistochemistry in H. pylori-infected tissues and H. pylori co-cultured cell lines. The regulation of AUF1 on GKN1 was determined by RNA pulldown assay, RNA immunoprecipitation, mRNA turnover, and luciferase activity assays. The involvement of phosphorylated extra-cellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) or CagA in H. pylori-induced AUF1 expression was verified using p-ERK inhibitor or CagA knockout H. pylori. In addition, the cell proliferation and migration capacities of AUF1-knockdown cells were investigated.||||GKN1 expression progressively decreased from H. pylori-infected gastritis to gastric cancer tissues. H. pylori co-culture also induced significant GKN1 reduction in GES-1 and BGC-823 cells. Besides, the mRNA level of GKN1 and AUF1 in human gastric mucosa showed negative correlation significantly. AUF1 knockdown resulted in upregulation of GKN1 expression and promoted GKN1 mRNA decay by binding the 3' untranslated region of GKN1 mRNA H. pylori-induced AUF1 expression was associated with p-ERK activation and CagA. Furthermore, knockdown of AUF1 significantly inhibited cell viability, migration ability, and arrested fewer cells in S-phase.||||Our data demonstrated that H. pylori infection downregulated GKN1 expression via the CagA/p-ERK/AUF1 pathway. AUF1 promoted gastric cancer at least partly through downregulating GKN1, which presented a novel potential target for the treatment of gastric cancer.

The FBXW2-MSX2-SOX2 axis regulates stem cell property and drug resistance of cancer cells.||||||||SOX2 is a key transcription factor that plays critical roles in maintaining stem cell property and conferring drug resistance. However, the underlying mechanisms by which SOX2 level is precisely regulated remain elusive. Here we report that MLN4924, also known as pevonedistat, a small-molecule inhibitor of neddylation currently in phase II clinical trials, down-regulates SOX2 expression via causing accumulation of MSX2, a known transcription repressor of SOX2 expression. Mechanistic characterization revealed that MSX2 is a substrate of FBXW2 E3 ligase. FBXW2 binds to MSX2 and promotes MSX2 ubiquitylation and degradation. Likewise, FBXW2 overexpression shortens the protein half-life of MSX2, whereas FBXW2 knockdown extends it. We further identified hypoxia as a stress condition that induces VRK2 kinase to facilitate MSX2-FBXW2 binding and FBXW2-mediated MSX2 ubiquitylation and degradation, leading to SOX2 induction via derepression. Biologically, expression of FBXW2 or SOX2 promotes tumor sphere formation, which is blocked by MSX2 expression. By down-regulating SOX2 through inactivation of FBXW2 E3 ligase, MLN4924 sensitizes breast cancer cells to tamoxifen in both in vitro and in vivo cancer cell models. Thus, a negative cascade of the FBXW2-MSX2-SOX2 axis was established, which regulates stem cell property and drug resistance. Finally, an inverse correlation of expression was found between FBXW2 and MSX2 in lung and breast cancer tissues. Collectively, our study revealed an anticancer mechanism of MLN4924. By inactivating FBXW2, MLN4924 caused MSX2 accumulation to repress SOX2 expression, leading to suppression of stem cell property and sensitization of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen.

BRD4 promotes tumor progression and NF-κB/CCL2-dependent tumor-associated macrophage recruitment in GIST.||||||||The most commonly occurring sarcoma of the soft tissue is gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Treatment and prevention of the disease necessitate an understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved. However, the role of BRD4 in the progression of GIST is still unclear. While it is known there are abundant infiltrating tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment, the exact role of these cells has yet to be studied. This work showed an upregulation of BRD4 in GIST that was associated with GIST prognosis. Through gain and loss of function studies, it was found that BRD4 promotes GIST growth and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, BRD4 enhances CCL2 expression by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway. Furthermore, this CCL2 upregulation causes recruitment of macrophages into the tumor leading to tumor growth. A likely mechanism for interactions in the GIST microenvironment has been outlined by this work to show the role and potential use of BRD4 as a treatment target in GIST.

Here, we mimicked an inflammatory microenvironment both in vitro and in vivo and investigated its effects on the invasion and metastasis of colon cancer. Moreover, colon cancer patient samples were also analyzed statistically. Conditioned medium from the differentiated macrophages induced invasion and migration of colon cancer cells in vitro, which could be reversed by the treatment of a neutralizing anti-growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) antibody, indicating GDF15 involvement in inflammation-induced invasiveness. Also, we observed similar effects of human recombinant GDF15 on colon cancer cells. Mechanistically, GDF15 activated c-Fos by separating it from Lamin A/C, increasing transcriptional activity of c-Fos and regulating EMT gene expressions. However, c-Fos knockdown using lentivirus shRNA plasmid inhibited GDF15-triggered invasion and migration in vitro. In vivo, inflammation caused by lipopolysaccharides obviously increased GDF15 secretion, and c-Fos knockdown reduced the lung metastasis of colon cancer cells in mice model. In addition, c-Fos expressions in patient samples were found to be associated with colon cancer metastasis and TNM stages. Taken together, GDF15 in inflammatory microenvironment induces colon cancer invasion and metastasis by regulating EMT genes by activating c-Fos, which might be a potential therapeutic target for metastatic colon cancer.

Crosstalk between colon cells and macrophages increases ST6GALNAC1 and MUC1-sTn expression in ulcerative colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer.||||||||Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have an increased risk of developing colitis-associated colon cancer (CACC). Changes in glycosylation of the oncoprotein MUC1 commonly occur in chronic inflammation, including UC, and this abnormally glycosylated MUC1 promotes cancer development and progression. It is not known what causes changes in glycosylation of MUC1. Gene expression profiling of myeloid cells in inflamed and malignant colon tissues showed increased expression levels of inflammatory macrophage-associated cytokines compared to normal tissues. We analyzed the involvement of macrophage-associated cytokines in the induction of aberrant MUC1 glycoforms. A co-culture system was used to examine the effects of M1 and M2 macrophages on glycosylation-related enzymes in colon cancer cells. M2-like macrophages induced the expression of the glycosyltransferase ST6GALNAC1, an enzyme that adds sialic acid to O-linked GalNAc residues, promoting the formation of tumor-associated sialyl-Tn (sTn) O-glycans. Immunostaining of UC and CACC tissue samples confirmed the elevated number of M2-like macrophages as well as high expression of ST6GALNAC1 and the altered MUC1-sTn glycoform on colon cells. Cytokine arrays and blocking antibody experiments indicated that the macrophage-dependent ST6GALNAC1 activation was mediated by IL-13 and CCL17. We demonstrated that IL-13 promoted phosphorylation of STAT6 to activate transcription of ST6GALNAC1. A computational model of signaling pathways was assembled and used to test IL-13 inhibition as a possible therapy. Our findings revealed a novel cellular cross-talk between colon cells and macrophages within the inflamed and malignant colon that contributes to the pathogenesis of UC and CACC.

This study aimed to investigate the role of CHCHD2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression of CHCHD2 in HCC and non-tumorous tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis, and the correlation between CHCHD2 expression and clinicopathological features of HCC was analyzed. Furthermore, the proliferation, apoptosis and migration of HepG2 cells with CHCHD2 knockdown were examined. We found that CHCHD2 was upregulated in HCC tissues, and high CHCHD2 expression was associated with poor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, local tissue invasion, high TNM grade of HCC and poor patient survival. Depletion of CHCHD2 led to significantly reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis and diminished migratory capacity in HepG2 cells. In addition, HCC tissues had high expression of CD105, a microvessel marker, and HepG2 cells depleted of CHCHD2 had low CD105 expression. In conclusion, CHCHD2 may play an oncogenic role in HCC via promoting tumor cell growth and migration while preventing apoptosis. CHCHD2 is a potential biomarker for poor outcome of HCC patients.

As an important core clock protein, brain and muscle arnt-like 1 (BMAL1) is closely related to tumorigenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate the role of BMAL1 in invasion and metastasis remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the BMAL1 may take a crucial effect in the progression of breast cancer cells.||||BMAL1 and MMP9 expression was measured in breast cell lines. Transwell and scratch wound-healing assays were used to detect the movement of cells and MTT assays and clonal formation assays were used to assess cells' proliferation. The effects of BMAL1 on the MMP9/NF-κB pathway were examined by western blotting, co-immunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid.||||In our study, it showed that cell migration and invasion were significantly enhanced when overexpressed BMAL1. Functionally, overexpression BMAL1 significantly increased the mRNA and protein level of matrix metalloproteinase9 (MMP9) and improved the activity of MMP9. Moreover, BMAL1 activated the NF-κB signaling pathway by increasing the phosphorylation of IκB and promoted human MMP9 promoter activity by interacting with NF-kB p65, leading to increased expression of MMP9. When overexpressed BMAL1, CBP (CREB binding protein) was recruited to enhance the activity of p65 and further activate the NF-κB signaling pathway to regulate the expression of its downstream target genes, including MMP9, TNFα, uPA and IL8, and then promote the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells.||||This study confirmed a new mechanism by which BMAL1 up-regulated MMP9 expression to increase breast cancer metastasis, to provide research support for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.

Circular RNA circ-FOXP1 induced by SOX9 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression via sponging miR-875-3p and miR-421.||||||||Circular RNA (circRNA) is a special type of endogenous non-coding RNA that plays an important role in carcinogenesis. However, its biological relevance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still largely uncharacterized. Here, we aimed to explore the function and clinical implication of circ-FOXP1 in HCC. We found that circ-FOXP1 was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues, serum and cell lines., which was attributed to the upregulation of oncogenic transcription factor SOX9. Depletion of circ-FOXP1 significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation, invasion and induced apoptosis. Nevertheless, overexpression of circ-FOXP1 displayed the opposite trend. Further mechanismic study revealed that circ-FOXP1 was preferentially located in the cytoplasm and could concurrently sponge miR-875-3p and miR-421, resulting in increasing levels of a cohort of their target oncogenes, including SOX9. Moreover, knockdown of circ-FOXP1 evidently retarded tumor growth in vivo, but this effect was significantly abolished after silencing of miR-875-3p or miR-421. Clinically, high circ-FOXP1 was closely correlated with larger tumor size, microvascular invasion, advanced TNM stage, and predicted poor prognosis. In addition, serum circ-FOXP1 level could effectively discriminate HCC patients from healthy controls. Collectively, our data clearly suggest that circ-FOXP1 is a novel driver for the tumorigenesis and aggressive progression of HCC, which provides a potential therapeutic target for patients with HCC.

Circulating IGF-1 promotes prostate adenocarcinoma via FOXO3A/BIM signaling in a double-transgenic mouse model.||||||||High circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels increase the risk of prostate cancer. However, whether circulating IGF-1 levels directly aggravate prostate cancer remains elusive.

The Hi-Myc/HIT mice had increased incidence and invasiveness of prostate cancer. IGF-1 elevation led to the accumulation of FOXO3A in the cytosol of prostate tumor cells and downregulation of its target gene Bim, which resulted in the apoptosis inhibition and prostate cancer overgrowth. The differential expressions of IGF-1R, FOXO3A, and BIM in the benign versus malignant prostate tissues supported a negative association between the FOXO3A/BIM axis and IGF-1R expression in human prostate adenocarcinoma. Our findings suggest that targeting the IGF-1/FOXO3A/BIM signaling axis could be an attractive strategy for prostate cancer prevention or treatment.

CKS2 promotes tumor progression and metastasis and is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in epithelial ovarian cancer.||||||||Accumulating evidence showed that dysregulation of cyclin-dependent kinases regulatory subunit 2 (CKS2) could contribute to tumor growth and metastasis of several tumors. However, its expression and function in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) have not been investigated. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of CKS2 in EOC.||||Real-time PCR and Western blotting were used to determine the mRNA and protein expression of CKS2 in EOC tissues and cell lines. Then, the associations of CKS2 expression with clinicopathological features and patient's overall survival were determined. Proliferation assay flow cytometric analysis and transwell assay were performed to detect the relation between CKS2 and malignant behaviors of EOC cells. We also evaluated the expression of related proteins of the Akt/mTOR pathway to determine the associated molecular mechanism.||||We found that CKS2 expression was significantly up-regulated in both EOC tissues and cell lines. Clinically, high expression of CKS2 was associated with advanced FIGO stage, histological grade and shorter overall survival of EOC patients. We also found that knockdown of CKS2 suppressed proliferation, invasion, and migration of EOC cells in vitro, and CKS2 could promote EMT progress by modulating EMT-related molecules. Finally, Western blot demonstrated that down-regulation of CKS2 suppressed the expression of p-Akt and p-mTOR.||||Our findings indicated that CKS2 might function as a tumor promoter by modulating Akt/mTOR pathway in EOC and could serve as a promising prognostic biomarker for EOC.

CLDN8 promotes colorectal cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by activating MAPK/ERK signaling.||||||||Claudin 8 (CLDN8), an integral membrane protein that constitutes tight junctions in cell membranes, was recently implicated in tumor progression. However, its roles in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and metastasis remain unknown.||||In this study, we examined the effect of CLDN8 on the progression of CRC, including cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and determines its underlying molecular mechanism using in vitro CRC cell lines and in vivo mouse xenograft models.||||We found that CLDN8 expression in human CRC tissues was significantly higher than that in adjacent normal tissues. The knockdown of CLDN8 markedly suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of SW480 and HT-29 CRC cells, whereas the overexpression of CLDN8 notably promoted tumor progression in SW480 and HT-29 CRC cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that CLDN8 upregulated p-ERK (p-PKB/AKT) and MMP9 in CRC cells. Notably, the MAPK/ERK inhibitor PD98095 dramatically attenuated the effects of CLDN8 on p-ERK and MMP9. Moreover, PD98095 remarkably blocked the tumor-promoting activity of CLDN8. The knockdown of CLDN8 also inhibited the in vivo tumor growth in a nude mouse xenograft model. Collectively, CLDN8 promoted CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, at least in part, by activating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.||||These findings suggest that CLDN8 exhibits an oncogenic effect in human CRC progression.

Caveolin-1 promotes invasion and metastasis by upregulating Pofut1 expression in mouse hepatocellular carcinoma.||||||||Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is an important structural protein of caveolae and plays an oncogene-like role by influencing protein glycosylation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. However, the mechanism by which Cav-1 promotes invasion and metastasis capacity has not been completely clarified. In this study, we demonstrate that Pofut1 is a fucosyltransferase induced by Cav-1. Mouse Hepa1-6 HCC cells lacking Cav-1 expression exhibited low transcription levels of Pofut1, whereas strong Pofut1 expression was found in high-metastasis-potential Hca-F cells with high levels of Cav-1. Cav-1 activated MAPK signaling and promoted phosphorylation of the transcription factors CREB, Sp1, HNF4A and c-Myc, which bound to the Pofut1 promoter region to induce its transcription. As Notch signaling receptors can be modified with O-fucose by Pofut1, we further showed that Cav-1-induced upregulation of Pofut1 expression activated the Notch pathway and thus enhanced invasion and metastasis by mouse HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which Cav-1 promotes tumor metastasis by upregulating expression of Pofut1, suggesting that Cav-1 may function as a new biomarker for HCC.

A Positive Tetraspanin 8 (TSPAN8)/β-Catenin Regulatory Loop Enhances the Stemness of Colorectal Cancer Cells.||||||||BACKGROUND The expression of TSPAN8 (tetraspanin 8) is upregulated in colorectal cancer; however, its roles in colorectal cancer progression are never been revealed. This work aimed to investigate TSPAN8 effects and the molecular basis in regulating colorectal cancer stemness. MATERIAL AND METHODS Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were used to detect the expression of TSPAN8 expression in clinical samples and the expression of stemness genes in colorectal cancer cells. Sphere forming analysis was performed to detect TSPAN8 effects on sphere forming ability of colorectal cancer cells. Co-IP and ChIP analysis were performed to confirm the molecular basis contributing to TSPAN8-mediated effects on colorectal cancer stemness. RESULTS TSPAN8 expression is increased in colorectal cancer tissues. Knockdown of TSPAN8 reduced the expression of stemness genes and sphere forming capacity in colorectal cancer cells. Mechanistically, TSPAN8 directly interacted ß-catenin and enhanced its protein expression, which is necessary for TSPAN8-mediated effects on colorectal cancer stemness. Conversely, ß-catenin directly bound to TSPAN8 promoter and enhanced TSPAN8 transcription. CONCLUSIONS TSPAN8 promotes colorectal cancer stemness through a positive TSPAN8/ß-catenin regulatory loop.

Epithelial membrane protein 1 promotes glioblastoma progression through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.||||||||Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant intracranial tumor. Although the affected patients are usually treated with surgery combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the median survival time for GBM patients is still approximately 12‑14 months. Identifying the key molecular mechanisms and targets of GBM development may therefore lead to the development of improved therapies for GBM patients. In the present study, the clinical significance and potential function of epithelial membrane protein 1 (EMP1) in malignant gliomas were investigated. Increased EMP1 expression was associated with increasing tumor grade (P<0.001) and worse prognosis in patients (P<0.001) based on TCGA, Rembrandt and CGGA databases for human gliomas. In vitro, gene silencing of EMP1 in U87MG and P3 GBM (primary glioma) cells significantly inhibited tumor proliferation and invasion. In addition, it was revealed that activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is the driving force of EMP1‑promoted glioma progression. Finally, it was demonstrated, using an intracranial GBM animal model, that EMP1 knockdown significantly inhibits tumor growth in vivo and increases overall survival in tumor‑bearing animals. Our research provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying EMP1 knockdown‑mediated inhibition of GBM cell invasion and raises the possibility that targeting of EMP1 may represent a promising strategy for the treatment of GBM.

However, the mechanisms of Ezrin in pancreatic cancer have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the functions and mechanisms of Ezrin in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer.||||Effects of Ezrin deregulation on pancreatic cancer phenotype were determined in Capan-1 and BxPC-3 cells using MTT, colony formation, transwell, wound-healing, and chick chorioallantoic membrane assays. To find out the underlying mechanism of Ezrin, multiple assays were performed to detect the effect of Ezrin on Akt pathway activation and YAP expression. Then, Ezrin and YAP expression was analyzed in pancreatic cancer and normal pancreas samples. Finally, the prognostic value of Ezrin and YAP was evaluated in pancreatic cancer patients.||||Ezrin promoted proliferation, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression, and angiogenesis of pancreatic cancers. Mechanistically, Ezrin activated Akt/mTOR pathways and induced YAP phosphorylation and nucleus translocation.

Moreover, both Ezrin and YAP were significantly overexpressed in pancreatic cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal pancreas, and correlated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. Multivariate survival analysis showed that Ezrin was an independent prognostic marker for pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, the expression status of Ezrin and YAP had positive correlations in pancreatic cancer tissues.||||Ezrin promoted pancreatic cancer proliferation, invasion, migration, and EMT progression, partially through activating the PI3K/Akt pathway, and also regulated YAP phosphorylation and translocation, partially through the PI3K/Akt pathway.

Targeting the Oncogenic FGF-FGFR Axis in Gastric Carcinogenesis.||||||||Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most wide-spread malignancies in the world. The oncogenic role of signaling of fibroblast growing factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) in gastric tumorigenesis has been gradually elucidated by recent studies. The expression pattern and clinical correlations of FGF and FGFR family members have been comprehensively delineated. Among them, FGF18 and FGFR2 demonstrate the most prominent driving role in gastric tumorigenesis with gene amplification or somatic mutations and serve as prognostic biomarkers. FGF-FGFR promotes tumor progression by crosstalking with multiple oncogenic pathways and this provides a rational therapeutic strategy by co-targeting the crosstalks to achieve synergistic effects. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the pathogenic mechanisms of FGF-FGFR signaling in gastric adenocarcinoma together with the current targeted strategies in aberrant FGF-FGFR activated GC cases.

FGF19-mediated upregulation of SOX18 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis by transactivating FGFR4 and FLT4.||||||||The poor prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is mainly attributed to its high rate of metastasis and recurrence. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HCC metastasis need to be elucidated. The SRY-related HMG box (SOX) family proteins, which are a group of highly conserved transcription factors, play important roles in cancer initiation and progression. Here, we report a novel role of SOX18, a member of the SOX family, in promoting HCC invasion and metastasis. The elevated expression of SOX18 was positively correlated with poor tumor differentiation, higher TNM stage, and poor prognosis. The overexpression of SOX18 promoted HCC metastasis by upregulating metastasis-related genes, including fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) and fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4). Knockdown of both FGFR4 and FLT4 significantly decreased SOX18-mediated HCC invasion and metastasis, while the stable overexpression of FGFR4 and FLT4 reversed the decrease in cell invasion and metastasis that was induced by the inhibition of SOX18. Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), which is the ligand of FGFR4, upregulated SOX18 expression. A mechanistic investigation indicated that the upregulation of SOX18 that was mediated by the FGF19-FGFR4 pathway relied on the p-FRS2/p-GSK3β/β-catenin pathway. SOX18 knockdown significantly reduced FGF19-enhanced HCC invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, BLU9931, a specific FGFR4 inhibitor, significantly reduced the SOX18-mediated HCC invasion and metastasis. In human HCC tissues, SOX18 expression was positively correlated with FGF19, FGFR4 and FLT4 expression, and patients that coexpressed FGF19/SOX18, SOX18/FGFR4, or SOX18/FLT4 had the worst prognosis. CONCLUSION: We defined a FGF19-SOX18-FGFR4 positive feedback loop that played a pivotal role in HCC metastasis, and targeting this pathway may be a promising therapeutic option for the clinical management of HCC.

HMGA1 promoting gastric cancer oncogenic and glycolytic phenotypes by regulating c-myc expression.||||||||The high mobility group A1 (HMGA1) protein, an architectural transcription factor, is profoundly implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of multiple malignant tumors. Reprogrammed energy metabolism is a hallmark of diverse types of cancer cells. However, little is known about the regulatory role of HMGA1 in aerobic glycolysis. In this study, we found that HMGA1 was highly expressed in many types of human cancers including gastric cancer and predicted a poor prognosis. However, high HMGA1 expression was not correlated with TNM stages. Gene set enrichment analysis result suggested a link between HMGA1 expression and glycolytic phenotype in gastric cancer. Genetic silencing of HMGA1 significantly inhibited gastric cancer glycolytic activity as revealed by reduced glucose uptake, lactate release, and extracellular acidification ratio. In addition, cell proliferation and invasive capacity of gastric cancer cells were also suppressed by HMGA1 knockdown. Mechanistically, the key glycolysis regulator c-Myc was identified as a downstream target of HMGA1. In gastric cancer patients, HMGA1 and c-Myc expression were closely associated with the glycolysis gene signature. Taken together, our findings identify a novel function of HMGA1 in regulating aerobic glycolysis in gastric cancer.

The aberrant expression of USP3 may have an important role in tumor development. However, the mechanism by which USP3 promotes gastric cancer (GC) metastasis remains largely unknown.||||Effects of USP3 on the progression of GC in vivo and in vitro and the potential underlying mechanisms have been investigated utilizing proteomics, RT-PCR, western blotting, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, cell invasion and migration assays and xenograft tumor models.||||USP3 expression was upregulated in GC compared with matched normal tissues and was predictive of poor survival. USP3 also promoted migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in GC cells. Moreover, TGF-β1 induced USP3 expression, and USP3 knockdown inhibited TGF-β1-induced EMT. Furthermore, we utilized Isobaric Tag for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) to identify differentially expressed proteins in USP3-overexpressing cells compared with control cells. Importantly, we found that SUZ12 is indispensable for USP3-mediated oncogenic activity in GC. We observed that USP3 interacted with and stabilized SUZ12 via deubiquitination. SUZ12 knockdown inhibited USP3-induced migration and invasion, as well as EMT in GC cells. Examination of clinical samples confirmed that USP3 expression was positively correlated with SUZ12 protein expression and that the levels of USP3 or SUZ12 protein were negatively correlated with the levels of E-cadherin protein.||||These findings identify USP3 as a critical regulator. The USP3-SUZ12 axis might promote tumor progression and could be a potential therapeutic candidate for human GC.

IL-8 protects prostate cancer cells from GSK-3β-induced oxidative stress by activating the mTOR signaling pathway.||||||||Both oxidative stress and inflammation play important roles in prostate cancer cell apoptosis or proliferation; however, the mechanisms underlying these processes remain unclear. Thus, we selected interleukin-8 (IL-8) as the bridge between inflammation and cancer cell oxidative stress-induced death and aimed to confirm its connection with mTOR and Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β).||||We overexpressed GSK-3β and observed its effect on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress-induced cell death. IL-8 was then upregulated or downregulated to determine its impact on preventing cell damage due to GSK-3β-induced oxidative stress. In addition, we overexpressed or knocked down mTOR to confirm its role in this process. Real-time PCR, Western blotting, transcription, Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8), and flow cytometry analyses were performed in addition to the use of other techniques.||||IL-8 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation and decreases apoptosis, whereas GSK-3β activates the caspase-3 signaling pathway by increasing ROS and thereby induces oxidative stress-mediated cell death. In addition, mTOR can also decrease activation of the caspase-3 signaling pathway by inhibiting GSK-3 and thus decreasing ROS production. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of IL-8 on GSK-3β occurs through the regulation of mTOR.||||The results of this study highlight the importance of GSK-3β, which increases the production of ROS and thereby induces oxidative stress in tumor cells, whereas IL-8 and mTOR attenuate oxidative stress to protect prostate cancer cells through inhibition of GSK-3β.

ILF3 promotes gastric cancer proliferation and may be used as a prognostic marker.||||||||Interleukin enhancer‑binding factor 3 (ILF3) may function as a transcriptional coactivator and has been reported to be involved in tumor proliferation and metastasis; however, its role and clinical value in gastric cancer (GC) remains unclear. To understand the value of ILF3 in GC, a total of 80 matched samples selected from GC tissues and the adjacent mucosa were used to evaluate the expression of ILF3 and its association with clinical characteristics. Furthermore, its biological functions and mechanisms were investigated using SGC‑7901 and BGC823 cell lines. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the positive expression rates of ILF3 in GC tissue were higher compared with those in adjacent mucosa (P<0.05). Significantly overexpressed ILF3 was detected in BGC823 and SGC7901 cells, and the MTT results demonstrated decreased cell activity after ILF3 expression was inhibited. The proportions of cells in the G0/G1 phase increased, while the number of cells in the G2/M phase decreased, and the expression of the genes associated with proliferation varied following inhibition of ILF3 (P<0.05). Positive expression of ILF3 was associated with a poor prognosis for patients with GC, and was an independent risk factor for GC (P<0.05). In conclusion, ILF3 is involved in the deterioration of GC by promoting proliferation of GC cells, and ILF3 protein detection may assist in the prediction of the prognosis of patients with GC.

Regulation of EZH2 by SMYD2-Mediated Lysine Methylation Is Implicated in Tumorigenesis.||||||||The histone methyl transferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a master transcriptional regulator involved in histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. We aimed to elucidate the precise post-translational regulations of EZH2 and their role in cancer pathogenesis. Here, we show that SET and MYND domain containing 2 (SMYD2) directly methylates EZH2 at lysine 307 (K307) and enhances its stability, which can be relieved by the histone H3K4 demethylase lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). SMYD2 is critical for EZH2 function in repressing a cohort of genes governing several cancer-associated pathways. In addition, SMYD2 promotes breast cancer cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and invasion through EZH2 K307 methylation, and it is markedly upregulated in various human cancers. Our data suggest that dynamic crosstalk between SMYD2-mediated EZH2 methylation plays an important role in fine-tuning EZH2 functions in chromatin recruitment and transcriptional repression.

Aberrantly elevated Bmi1 promotes cervical cancer tumorigenicity and tumor sphere formation via enhanced transcriptional regulation of Sox2 genes.||||||||The exact molecular mechanisms underlying cervical tumorigenesis are poorly understood. Polycomb complex protein Bmi1 (Bmi1) is involved in the malignant transformation and biological aggressiveness of several human carcinomas. Therefore, the present study assessed the expression of Bmi1 protein in human cervical cancer tissues and examined the mechanisms involved in cervical carcinogenesis. The expression of Bmi1 protein was examined by immunohistochemistry in cervical carcinoma tissues (n=71), high‑grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (n=41) and normal cervical tissues (n=47). Expression of Bmi1 protein gradually increased across samples from the normal cervix (1/47; 2.12%), high‑grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (5/42; 16.13%) and cervical carcinomas (31/71; 43.66%; P<0.05). Additionally, Bmi1 protein expression was associated with tumor histopathological grade. The effects of Bmi1 silencing and overexpression on tumor sphere formation and the tumorigenicity of cervical cancer cells were investigated. Overexpression of Bmi1 resulted in significantly attenuated tumor formation and tumor sphere formation. Consistently, Bmi1 silencing significantly inhibited tumor formation and tumor sphere formation. Furthermore, Bmi1 upregulated the expression of Sox2, and the dual‑luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that Bmi1 transactivated Sox2 by binding to the two E‑box motifs in the Sox2 promoter. In conclusion, aberrantly elevated Bmi1 promotes cervical cancer tumorigenicity and tumor sphere formation via enhanced transcriptional regulation of Sox2 genes as a potential oncogenic factor that participates in the carcinogenesis of cervical carcinomas.

A drug library screen identifies Carbenoxolone as novel FOXO inhibitor that overcomes FOXO3-mediated chemoprotection in high-stage neuroblastoma.||||||||The transcription factor FOXO3 has been associated in different tumor entities with hallmarks of cancer, including metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, maintenance of tumor-initiating stem cells, and drug resistance. In neuroblastoma (NB), we recently demonstrated that nuclear FOXO3 promotes tumor angiogenesis in vivo and chemoresistance in vitro. Hence, inhibiting the transcriptional activity of FOXO3 is a promising therapeutic strategy. However, as no FOXO3 inhibitor is clinically available to date, we used a medium-throughput fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) screening in a drug-repositioning approach to identify compounds that bind to the FOXO3-DNA-binding-domain (DBD). Carbenoxolone (CBX), a glycyrrhetinic acid derivative, was identified as a potential FOXO3-inhibitory compound that binds to the FOXO3-DBD with a binding affinity of 19 µM. Specific interaction of CBX with the FOXO3-DBD was validated by fluorescence-based electrophoretic mobility shift assay (FAM-EMSA). CBX inhibits the transcriptional activity of FOXO3 target genes, as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), DEPP-, and BIM promoter reporter assays, and real-time RT-PCR analyses. In high-stage NB cells with functional TP53, FOXO3 triggers the expression of SESN3, which increases chemoprotection and cell survival. Importantly, FOXO3 inhibition by CBX treatment at pharmacologically relevant concentrations efficiently repressed FOXO3-mediated SESN3 expression and clonogenic survival and sensitized high-stage NB cells to chemotherapy in a 2D and 3D culture model. Thus, CBX might be a promising novel candidate for the treatment of therapy-resistant high-stage NB and other "FOXO-resistant" cancers.

Tac2-N acts as a novel oncogene and promotes tumor metastasis via activation of NF-κB signaling in lung cancer.||||||||High rates of recurrence and metastasis are the major cause of the poor outcomes for patients with lung cancer. In previous research, we have demonstrated that Tac2-N promotes tumor growth by suppressing p53 signaling in lung cancer. Beyond that, other biological functions and clinical significance of Tac2-N in lung cancer progression are still unknown.||||Tissue microarrays of 272 lung cancer patients were constructed to assess the association of Tac2-N expression and prognosis of lung cancer patients with different clinical stages. The protein expression of Tac2-N in metastatic and non-metastatic specimens were detected by IHC. In vitro migration and invasion and in vivo nude mice metastasis model were used to evaluate the effect of Tac2-N ectopic expression on metastasis capability of lung cancer cells. The downstream signaling pathway of Tac2-N was explored using luciferase reporter assays and WB.||||The expression of Tac2-N was associated with advanced stages, but not with early stages (P = 0.513). Tac2-N expression is sharply overexpressed in metastatic tumors compared with non-metastatic tumors. In vitro and in vivo assays suggested that Tac2-N facilitated migration and invasion of lung cancer cells in vitro and promoted tumor metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, Tac2-N increased the degradation of IκB by promoting its phosphorylation, and subsequently activated NF-κB activity by facilitating the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and stimulating the transcription of targets, MMP7 and MMP9. Notably, the C2B domain of Tac2-N was crucial for Tac2-N to activate NF-κB signal. Blockage of NF-κB by shRNA or inhibitor attenuates the function of Tac2-N in the promotion of metastasis.||||Our study provided proof of principle to show that Tac2-N serves as a novel oncogene gene and plays an important role in the progression and metastasis of lung cancer.

EGFRvIII epigenetically regulates ARHI to promote glioma cell proliferation and migration.||||||||Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) is a tumor-specific mutation widely expressed in glioma. However, its role and molecular mechanism in glioma have not been completely elucidated. Immunohistochemistry analyses of EGFRvIII, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and aplysia ras homolog I (ARHI) were performed in tumor tissues from patients with glioma. Regulatory mechanisms among EGFRvIII, EZH2 and ARHI were examined by western blot and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Cell proliferation and migration of glioma cells were examined. EGFRvIII and EZH2 expression were upregulated, while ARHI was downregulated in glioma tissues. EZH2 knockdown increased ARHI expression in glioma cell lines. ChIP assay suggested that EZH2 was enriched in the ARHI promoter. Furthermore, ectopic expression of EGFRvIII upregulated EZH2, suppressed ARHI expression, and promoted glioma cell proliferation. Additionally, treatment with 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep, an inhibitor of EZH2) inhibited expression of EZH2, increased protein level of ARHI, and partially abrogated the promoting effects of ARHI knockdown on glioma cell proliferation and migration. In summary, EGFRvIII-mediated epigenetic suppression of ARHI promoted glioma cell proliferation and migration via upregulating EZH2.

CXCL12 promotes human ovarian cancer cell invasion through suppressing ARHGAP10 expression.||||||||The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is strongly implicated as key determinant of tumor invasion and metastasis in ovarian cancer. However, little is known about the potential downstream signals of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis that contribute to ovarian cancer cell invasion and metastasis. ARHGAP10, a member of Rho GTPase activating proteins is a potential tumor suppressor gene in ovarian cancer. In this study, a negative correlation between the protein levels of CXCL12, CXCR4, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) and ARHGAP10 was uncovered in ovarian cancer tissues and paired adjacent noncancerous tissues. CXCL12 stimulation reduced the expression of ARHGAP10. Furthermore, the pretreatment of CXCR4 inhibitor (AMD3100) or the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) inhibitor (SU1498) abrogated the CXCL12-deduced expression of ARHGAP10. Finally, an in vitro functional assay revealed that CXCL12 did not stimulate ovarian cancer cell invasion when ARHGAP10 was overexpressed or when ovarian cancer cells were pre-treated with AMD3100 or SU1498. Knockdown of ARHGAP10 significantly suppressed the inhibitory effects of SU1498 on ovarian cancer cell invasion and lung metastasis. In summary, these findings suggest that CXCL12/CXCR4 promotes ovarian cancer cell invasion by suppressing ARHGAP10 expression, which is mediated by VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling.

Here, we found NGLGN3 was significantly upregulated in neuroblastoma cells and tissues, its overexpression significantly promoted neuroblastoma cell proliferation and growth determined by MTT analysis, colony formation assay, cell cycle progression analysis, BrdU incorporation assay and animal model, while its knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and growth. Then we found NLGN3 could increase the phosphorylation level of AKT and the transcription activity of FOXO family, suggesting NLGN3 activated PI3K/AKT pathway, inhibition of PI3K/AKT pathway in NLGN3 overexpressing cells inhibited cell proliferation, confirming NLGN3 promoted neuroblastoma proliferation through activating PI3K/AKT pathway. In summary, we found NLGN3 promoted neuroblastoma cell proliferation and growth through activating PI3K/AKT pathway and providing a new target for neuroblastoma therapy.

CCL2 promotes cell migration by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition in oral squamous cell carcinoma.||||||||Although a few studies suggested that the chemokine CCL2 might be involved in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the exact mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the resource of CCL2 in lesions and explored a potential mechanism that CCL2 promotes tumor progression. The study was an effort to provide new insights into the pathological role of CCL2 in OSCC.||||Specimens of OSCC and normal oral mucosa were stained using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess the CCL2 expression. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the difference of CCL2 between OSCC and normal oral mucosa cell lines. In addition, we treated OSCC cells with exogenous rCCL2 combined with or without CCL2 neutralizing antibody and then determined the changes of in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and cell migration capacity using immunofluorescence, Western blotting, transwell migration, and wound healing assays.||||We have found that CCL2 expression was upregulated significantly in both lesions and cell culture supernatant of OSCC compared with controls. IHC staining demonstrated that CCL2 expression was primarily located in the cytoplasm and cell membrane of cells. We have also found that rCCL2 could effectively induce EMT through upregulating Snail in OSCC cells, which was demonstrated by the decrease of E-cadherin and the increase of vimentin. In addition, we have found that CCL2 neutralizing antibody could block EMT induced by CCL2 in OSCC.||||CCL2 secreted by cancer cells can promote cell migration by inducing EMT via paracrine or autocrine in OSCC.

However, little is known about how IL-8 promotes the metastasis and invasion of ovarian cancers cells. In this study, we found that IL-8 and its receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 were up-regulated in advanced ovarian serous cancer tissues. Furthermore, the level of IL-8 and its receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 expression were associated with ovarian cancer stage, grade and lymph node metastasis. In vitro, IL-8 promoted ovarian cancer cell migration, initiated the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program and activated Wnt/β-catenin signalling. However, when treated with Reparixin (inhibitor of both IL-8 receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2), effect of both endogenous and exogenous IL-8 was reversed. Together, our results indicated that IL-8 triggered ovarian cancer cells migration partly through Wnt/β-catenin pathway mediated EMT, and IL-8 may be an important molecule in the invasion and metastasis of ovarian cancer.

IQGAP1 promotes pancreatic cancer progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through Wnt/β-catenin signaling.||||||||IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) is a scaffold protein that participates in several cellular functions, including cytoskeletal regulation, cell adhesion, gene transcription and cell polarization. IQGAP1 has been implicated in the tumorigenesis and progression of several human cancers. However, the role of IQGAP1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is still unknown. We found that IQGAP1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for PDAC. IQGAP1 upregulation significantly promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereas IQGAP1 downregulation impaired its oncogenic functions. Overexpression of IQGAP1 increased the protein level of Dishevelled2 (DVL2) and enhanced canonical Wnt signaling as evidenced by increased DVL2 level, β-catenin transcriptional activity, β-catenin nuclear translocation and expression of the direct target genes of β-catenin (cyclin D1 and c-myc). In contrast, knockdown of IQGAP1 decreased the level of DVL2 and attenuated Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In vivo results revealed that IQGAP1 promoted tumor growth and metastasis. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that IQGAP1 interacted with both DVL2 and β-catenin. Moreover, knockdown of DVL2 reversed IQGAP1-induced EMT. Our findings thus confirmed that IQGAP1 could be used as a potential target for PDAC treatment.

Repression of transcription factor AP-2 alpha by PPARγ reveals a novel transcriptional circuit in basal-squamous bladder cancer.||||||||The discovery of bladder cancer transcriptional subtypes provides an opportunity to identify high risk patients, and tailor disease management. Recent studies suggest tumor heterogeneity contributes to regional differences in molecular subtype within the tumor, as well as during progression and following treatment. Nonetheless, the transcriptional drivers of the aggressive basal-squamous subtype remain unidentified. As PPARɣ has been repeatedly implicated in the luminal subtype of bladder cancer, we hypothesized inactivation of this transcriptional master regulator during progression results in increased expression of basal-squamous specific transcription factors (TFs) which act to drive aggressive behavior. We initiated a pharmacologic and RNA-seq-based screen to identify PPARɣ-repressed, basal-squamous specific TFs. Hierarchical clustering of RNA-seq data following treatment of three human bladder cancer cells with a PPARɣ agonist identified a number of TFs regulated by PPARɣ activation, several of which are implicated in urothelial and squamous differentiation. One PPARɣ-repressed TF implicated in squamous differentiation identified is Transcription Factor Activating Protein 2 alpha (TFAP2A). We show TFAP2A and its paralog TFAP2C are overexpressed in basal-squamous bladder cancer and in squamous areas of cystectomy samples, and that overexpression is associated with increased lymph node metastasis and distant recurrence, respectively. Biochemical analysis confirmed the ability of PPARɣ activation to repress TFAP2A, while PPARɣ antagonist and PPARɣ siRNA knockdown studies indicate the requirement of a functional receptor. In vivo tissue recombination studies show TFAP2A and TFAP2C promote tumor growth in line with the aggressive nature of basal-squamous bladder cancer. Our findings suggest PPARɣ inactivation, as well as TFAP2A and TFAP2C overexpression cooperate with other TFs to promote the basal-squamous transition during tumor progression.

Cell-intrinsic PD-1 promotes proliferation in pancreatic cancer by targeting CYR61/CTGF via the hippo pathway.||||||||Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a refractory disease. Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) monotherapy has shown strong performance in targeting several malignancies. However, the effect and mechanism of intrinsic PD-1 in pancreatic cancer cells is still unknown. In this study, associations between clinicopathological characteristics and stained tissue microarrays of PDAC specimens were analyzed along with profiling and functional analyses. The results showed that cell-intrinsic PD-1 was significantly correlated with overall survival (OS). Independently of adaptive immunity, intrinsic PD-1 promoted tumor growth in PDAC. Concomitantly, the overexpression of intrinsic PD-1 enhanced cancer proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, PD-1 binds to the downstream MOB1, thereby inhibiting its phosphorylation. Moreover, greater synergistic tumor suppression in vitro resulted from combining Hippo inhibitors with anti-PD-1 treatment compared with the suppression achieved by either single agent alone. Additionally, Hippo downstream targets, CYR61 (CCN1) and CTGF (CCN2), were directly affected by PD-1 mediated Hippo signaling activation in concert with survival outcomes. Finally, the formulated nomogram showed superior predictive accuracy for OS in comparison with the TNM stage alone. Therefore, PD-1 immunotherapy in combination with Hippo pathway inhibitors may optimize the anti-tumor efficacy in PDAC patients via targeting cell-intrinsic PD-1.

WB was used to detect the expression of IL-1RA and interleukin-1α in esophageal cancer cells. Stable ESCC cell models overexpressing the IL-1RA were constructed. Their cell functions were tested, and their effects on VEGF were examined.||||IL-1RA is downregulated in primary EC tumors, and this downregulation of IL-1RA is closely related to TNM staging and survival prognosis. The overexpression of IL-1RA increased the proliferation of KYSE410 EC cells, which have a high level of IL-1α expression. Overexpression of IL-1RA in KYSE410 cells promotes a decrease in the expression of VEGF-A. However, IL-1RA expression did not cause any changes in EC9706 cells with low IL-1α expression.||||IL-1RA acts as a tumor suppressor, and its deletion promotes tumor progression by increasing VEGF-A expression in ESCC.

NRF2 addiction in lung cancer cells and its impact on cancer therapy.||||||||Nuclear factor erythroid 2-like factor 2 (NRF2) is a master regulator of the antioxidant enzymes and the detoxification proteins that play major roles in redox homeostasis. Although it plays a protective role against tumorigenesis, emerging evidence has shown that the NRF2 pathway is frequently altered in different types of cancer, including lung cancer. NRF2 activation influences many of the hallmarks of cancer and their signaling pathways, mainly apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and metabolic reprogramming to establish cellular metabolic processes leading to "NRF2 addiction" in lung cancer cells. Intriguingly, constitutive activation of NRF2 promotes cancer development as well as resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and these malignant phenotypes lead to a poor prognosis in lung cancer patients. Therefore, targeted inhibition of the NRF2 together with traditional chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, may be a promising approach to improving the survival rates of the NRF2-addicted lung cancer cases. Here we summarize the recent advances in NRF2-addicted lung cancer.

IQGAP1 promotes pancreatic cancer progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through Wnt/β-catenin signaling.||||||||IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) is a scaffold protein that participates in several cellular functions, including cytoskeletal regulation, cell adhesion, gene transcription and cell polarization. IQGAP1 has been implicated in the tumorigenesis and progression of several human cancers. However, the role of IQGAP1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is still unknown. We found that IQGAP1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for PDAC. IQGAP1 upregulation significantly promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereas IQGAP1 downregulation impaired its oncogenic functions. Overexpression of IQGAP1 increased the protein level of Dishevelled2 (DVL2) and enhanced canonical Wnt signaling as evidenced by increased DVL2 level, β-catenin transcriptional activity, β-catenin nuclear translocation and expression of the direct target genes of β-catenin (cyclin D1 and c-myc). In contrast, knockdown of IQGAP1 decreased the level of DVL2 and attenuated Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In vivo results revealed that IQGAP1 promoted tumor growth and metastasis. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that IQGAP1 interacted with both DVL2 and β-catenin. Moreover, knockdown of DVL2 reversed IQGAP1-induced EMT. Our findings thus confirmed that IQGAP1 could be used as a potential target for PDAC treatment.

LncRNA PTCSC3 inhibits cell proliferation in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma by down-regulating lncRNA HOTAIR.||||||||It is known that lncRNA PTCSC3 inhibits thyroid cancer and glioma and STAT3 promotes cancer development. We, in the present study, investigated the potential involvement of PTCSC3 in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and explored its interactions with STAT3. In the present study, we showed that plasma PTCSC3 was down-regulated in early stage LSCC patients, and the down-regulation of PTCSC3 separated in early stage LSCC patients from control group. LncRNA HOTAIR was up-regulated in early stage LSCC patients and was significantly and inversely correlated with PTCSC3 in LSCC patients. PTCSC3 overexpression led to the inhibition of HOTAIR, while PTCSC3 expression was not significantly affected by HOTAIR overexpression. PTCSC3 overexpression mediated the inhibited, while HOTAIR overexpression mediated the promoted proliferation of LSCC cells. However, cell invasion and migration were not significantly affected by PTCSC3 overexpression. In addition, HOTAIR overexpression reduced the inhibitory effects of PTCSC3 overexpression on cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, PTCSC3 overexpression mediated the down-regulation of STAT3 and STAT3 overexpression mediated the up-regulation of HOTAIR. Therefore, PTCSC3 may negatively interact with HOTAIR through STAT3 to inhibit LSCC cell proliferation.

KDELR2 Promotes Glioblastoma Tumorigenesis Targeted by HIF1a via mTOR Signaling Pathway.||||||||The KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) receptors (KDELRs), proteins with seven transmembrane domains, are primarily responsible for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis. Recent studies have found additional function of KDELRs in growth, cellular secretory traffic, immune response, and autophagy; however, its role in tumorigenesis is still poorly understood. Here, we showed that KDELR2 is highly expressed in glioblastoma (GBM) tissues. Reviewing the expression of KDELR2 in TCGA and REMBRANDT database, we found that higher expression of KDELR2 is associated with shorter survival of GBM patients. We explored the effect of KDELR2 on tumorigenesis in GBM cells and animal model (nude mice), and identified KDELR2 as oncogene promoting cell proliferation. Additionally, KDELR2 expression in GBM cells correlated positively with HIF1alpha (HIF1α) expression, and we demonstrated by ChIP-qPCR and luciferase reporter assay that the upstream region of the KDELR2 gene is directly targeted by HIF1alpha. Taken together, our data suggest that KDELR2 is a target gene downstream of HIF1-alpha driving the malignancy of GBM and could eventually serve as a therapeutic target for the treatment of GBM patients.
