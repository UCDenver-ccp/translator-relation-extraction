Biomarkers of Targeted Therapy and Immuno-Oncology in Cancers Metastatic to the Breast.||||||||The breast is a rare site for metastases, and their molecular characteristics have not been studied yet. Intrinsic molecular genetics, cancer characteristics, and breast tissue immune responses in diverse metastases to the breast have not been previously studied. We identified 64 patients with cancers metastatic to the breast: 51 carcinomas and 13 melanomas. Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), steroid receptors, and HER2/neu expressions were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Gene sequencing, copy number alterations, microsatellite instability, and tumor mutational burden were performed using next-generation sequencing platforms. The 3 most common primary sites for metastatic carcinomas were lung (37%), ovary (29%), and fallopian tubes/peritoneum (14%). TP53 mutations were commonly (50%) observed among the carcinoma cases, while other mutations were characteristic for the primary cancers (VHL in renal, BRCA1 in the fallopian tube, and BRAF in melanomas). High tumor mutational burden was detected in 5/14 carcinomas and 3/7 melanomas. Tumor cell PD-L1 expression was detected in 6 carcinomas, but not in any of the melanomas, whereas immune cells' expression of PD-L1 was seen in 17 carcinomas and 6 melanomas. Estrogen receptor status was positive in 13/49 carcinomas including 12 adenocarcinomas originating from the ovary and fallopian tube or peritoneum and 1 duodenal neuroendocrine carcinoma. No carcinoma was HER2/neu positive. Intrinsic genetic characteristics of the metastases to the breast followed the pattern commonly seen in primary tumors. Biomarkers of potential benefit to immune checkpoint inhibition therapy were limited to PD-L1-positive non-small cell lung cancer. No common characteristics of the heterogeneous group of tumor metastases to this organ were identified.

Rare variants of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma -differential immunohistochemical profiles.||||||||We aimed to immunohistochemically characterize the pattern of expression of epithelial markers in rare head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) variants: carcinoma cuniculatum (CC) and adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC). We also present an additional variant of HNSCC with concomitant basaloid and squamous components that has overlapping morphological features with odontogenic and non-odontogenic tumors, which we termed basalo-squamous carcinoma (BSC). The selected markers included CK5/6, p40, CK19, BerEP4, p16 and SOX10. All tumors were CK5/6 and p40 positive. CK19 and BerEP4 were positive in BSC and focally in ASC but negative in CC. p16 was positive in 3 (60%) of the CCs, focally positive in ASC and negative in BSC. SOX10 was negative in all three variants. Our results highlight the plasticity of the lining epithelium revealing differential profiles of immuno-expression of the selected molecular markers, possibly reflecting their diverse histopathogenesis.

Addition of IMP3 to L1CAM for discrimination between low- and high-grade endometrial carcinomas: a European Network for Individualised Treatment of Endometrial Cancer collaboration study.||||||||Discrimination between low- and high-grade endometrial carcinomas (ECs) is clinically relevant but can be challenging for pathologists, with moderate interobserver agreement. Insulin-like growth factor-II mRNA-binding protein 3 (IMP3) is an oncofoetal protein that is associated with nonendometrioid endometrial carcinomas but has been limited studied in endometrioid carcinomas. The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of IMP3 in the discrimination between low- and high-grade ECs and its added value to L1CAM. IMP3 and L1CAM expression was assessed in tumors from 378 patients treated for EC at 1 of 9 participating European Network for Individualised Treatment of Endometrial Cancer centers. IMP3 was expressed in 24.6% of the tumors. In general, IMP3 was more homogeneously expressed than L1CAM. IMP3 expression was significantly associated with advanced stage, nonendometrioid histology, grade 3 tumors, deep myometrial invasion, lymphovascular space invasion, distant recurrences, overall mortality, and disease-related mortality. Simultaneous absence of IMP3 and L1CAM expression showed the highest accuracy for identifying low-grade carcinomas (area under the curve 0.766), whereas simultaneous expression of IMP3 and L1CAM was strongly associated with high-grade carcinomas (odds ratio 19.7; 95% confidence interval 9.2-42.2). Even within endometrioid carcinomas, this combination remained superior to IMP3 and L1CAM alone (odds ratio 8.6; 95% confidence interval 3.4-21.9). In conclusion, IMP3 has good diagnostic value and together with L1CAM represents the optimal combination of diagnostic markers for discrimination between low- and high-grade ECs compared to IMP3 and L1CAM alone. Because of the homogenous expression of IMP3, this marker might be valuable in preoperative biopsies when compared to the more patchy L1CAM expression.

We aimed to identify and compare TBK1 mutations to clinical features in a cohort of ALS patients from Northern England.||||TBK1 mutations were analysed in 290 ALS cases. Immunohistochemistry was performed in brain and spinal cord of one case with a novel in-frame deletion.||||Seven TBK1 variants were identified, including one novel in-frame deletion (p.85delIle). In silico analysis and literature suggested four variants were pathogenic, and three were variants of uncertain significance or benign. Post-mortem immunohistochemistry established an individual with the novel in-frame deletion had classical ALS and Type B FTLD-TDP pathology, with no changes in TBK1 staining or interferon regulatory factor IRF3.||||TBK1 mutations were present in 1.38% of our cohort, and screening showed no clear genotype-phenotype associations compared to other genetic and sporadic ALS cases. TBK1 immunohistochemistry was consistent with previously published literature and we are the first to show no differential expression of interferon regulatory factor IRF3, a downstream effector of TBK1 in the immune pathway, in the TBK1-mutant tissue, compared to controls.

The Roles of TIF1γ in Cancer.||||||||Transcriptional intermediary factor 1 γ (TIF1γ), also known as TRIM33, RFG7, PTC7, or Ectodermin, is an E3 ubiquitin-ligase family member with a ring-box-coiled-coil region. It can regulate TGF-β/Smad signaling in two different ways in different cellular contexts. On one hand, TIF1γ can monoubiquitinate Smad4 to inhibit the formation of Smad2/3/4 nuclear complexes. On the other hand, TIF1γ can function as a cofactor of phosphorylated (p)-Smad2/3, competing with Smad4 to inhibit the formation of the Smad2/3/4 complex. In addition, TIF1γ has been reported to play a role in transcription elongation, cellular differentiation, embryonic development, and mitosis. As transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily signaling plays an important role in the occurrence and development of cancer, and TIF1γ was reported to be involved in the regulation of TGF-β superfamily signaling, studies on TIF1γ during the last decade have focused on its role in the development of cancer. However, TIF1γ can function either as a tumor suppressor or promoter in different cellular contexts, yet there are few reviews focusing on the roles of TIF1γ in cancer. Hence, in this paper we systematically review and discuss the roles of TIF1γ in cancer. Firstly, we review the biological features, the regulatory mechanisms and the related signaling pathways of TIF1γ. Next, we illustrate the roles of TIF1γ in different tumors. We then provide a tentative hypothesis that explains the dual roles of TIF1 γ in cancer. Finally, we provide our viewpoint regarding the future developments of cancer research focusing on TIF1γ, especially in relation to the effects of TIF1γ on tumoral immunity.

While its expression in airway epithelial cells is correlated with the thickness of airway basement membrane, more importantly, periostin can be detected stably in blood with little variability, reflecting airway type-2 inflammation and remodeling. As for a result, serum periostin can serve as a valuable marker to identify patients with type-2 severe asthma who are insensitive to inhaled corticosteroids, and consequently have the excess decline of pulmonary function with asthma exacerbations. Serum periostin may significantly help to improve management of patients with severe asthma.

Once activated, Akt modulates the function of many downstream proteins involved in cellular survival, proliferation, migration, metabolism, and angiogenesis. The Akt is a central node of many signaling pathways and it is frequently deregulated in many types of human cancers. In this review, we provide an overview of Akt function and its role in the hallmarks of human cancer. We also discussed various mechanisms of Akt dysregulation in cancers, including epigenetic modifications like methylation, post-transcriptional non-coding RNAs-mediated regulation, and the overexpression and mutation.

Mismatch Repair Deficiency in Endometrial Cancer: Immunohistochemistry Staining and Clinical Implications.||||||||DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency is associated with increased risk of developing several types of cancer and is the most common cause of hereditary endometrial cancer. Identification of the microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype in endometrial carcinoma is important given that such tumors are frequent.||||The objective of this study was to assess the utility of immunohistochemistry (IHC), a simple and fast technique, in detecting MSI status in endometrial carcinoma and evaluate the correlation between the MSI phenotype and the various anatomo-clinical parameters.||||IHC expression of 4 markers (MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, and MSH6) was studied. For all IHC markers, a combined score based on the intensity of nuclear labeling and the percentage of labeled cells was defined to establish a score. Correlation between MSI phenotype and different clinicopathologic parameters was evaluated using statistical analysis (software STATA and the Fisher exact test).||||The mean age of the patients was 58.6 years. Positive staining was highly extended (score 3) with 79% to 100% of marked cells. Less than 10% of positive tumor cells were seen in 3% of cases for MSH6 and PMS2. Abnormal MMR IHC was detected in 10 cases (22.22%). Seven tumors showed loss of MLH1/PMS2. The loss of MSH2/MSH6 was observed in 1 case. The loss of MLH1 or PMS2 was seen only in 2 cases. The number of MSI positive status was 10 cases (22.7%). Correlation between clinicopathologic parameters showed MMR deficiency was significantly associated with low-grade tumor and localized stage. There was no positive correlation between age, histologic subtype, or myometrium invasion.||||In summary, detection of DNA MMR deficiencies by IHC can effectively diagnose the MSI phenotype in endometrial carcinoma. Correlation between clinicopathologic parameters showed MMR deficiency was significantly associated with low-grade tumor and localized stage.

Interleukin-1 Genotype in Periodontitis.||||||||This paper presents the current knowledge concerning the role of polymorphisms of IL1A and IL1B genes in periodontitis. Attention has been paid to the role of IL-1 in the pathogenesis of the disease, and to the significance of a genetic test, investigating the presence of composite two polymorphisms of IL-1 gene, as a risk factor for severe periodontitis. The significance of this test for prevention of periodontitis and its therapy has been discussed. IL-1 polymorphisms have been presented and described according to the reference single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identification number (rsID), established to eradicate the redundancy of reported polymorphisms in the SNP database processed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The prevalence of these genotypes in different populations and ethnic groups and its effect on periodontal health have been discussed. The presented data show inconsistent results. It seems that at least two polymorphisms, rs1800587 and rs1143634, are associated with periodontal inflammation. Therefore, they can be regarded as candidate genes involved in further periodontitis risk assessment. It seems that geographical and ethnical factors can play a great role, as the prevalence of specific polymorphisms varies greatly depending on the population studied.

TIMP-3 as a therapeutic target for cancer.||||||||Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3), a secreted glycoprotein, plays an important role in carcinogenesis. It can bind to many proteinases to suppress their activity and thus protect the extracellular matrix from degradation. TIMP-3 may have many anticancer properties, including apoptosis induction and antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, and antimetastatic activities. This review summarizes the structure, proteinase inhibition ability, genetic and epigenetic regulation, cancer therapy potential, and contribution to cancer development of TIMP-3. Furthermore, in this review we discuss its potential as a biomarker for predicting cancer progression and the current state of drugs that target TIMP-3, either alone or in combination with clinical treatment. In conclusion, TIMP-3 can be a biomarker of cancer and a potential target for cancer therapy. This review article can serve as a basis to understand how to modulate TIMP-3 levels as a drug target of cancers.

A proposal of structural and functional classification.||||||||The human TET2 gene plays a pivotal role in the epigenetic regulation of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Somatic TET2 mutations have been repeatedly identified in age-related clonal hematopoiesis and in myeloid neoplasms ranging from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to myeloproliferative neoplasms. However, there have been no attempts to systematically explore the structural and functional consequences of the hundreds of TET2 missense variants reported to date.||||We have sequenced the TET2 gene in 189 Spanish AML patients using Sanger sequencing and NGS protocols. Next, we performed a thorough bioinformatics analysis of TET2 protein and of the expected impact of all reported TET2 missense variants on protein structure and function, exploiting available structure-and-function information as well as 3D structure prediction tools.||||We have identified 38 TET2 allelic variants in the studied patients, including two frequent SNPs: p.G355D (10 cases) and p.I1762V (28 cases). Four of the detected mutations are reported here for the first time: c.122C>T (p.P41L), c.4535C>G (p.A1512G), c.4760A>G (p.D1587G), and c.5087A>T (p.Y1696F). We predict a complex multidomain architecture for the noncatalytic regions of TET2, and in particular the presence of well-conserved α+β globular domains immediately preceding and following the actual catalytic unit. Further, we provide a rigorous interpretation of over 430 missense SNVs that affect the TET2 catalytic domain, and we hypothesize explanations for ~700 additional variants found within the regulatory regions of the protein. Finally, we propose a systematic classification of all missense mutants and SNPs reported to date into three major categories (severe, moderate, and mild), based on their predicted structural and functional impact.||||The proposed classification of missense TET2 variants would help to assess their clinical impact on human neoplasia and may guide future structure-and-function investigations of TET family members.

Meanwhile, emerging studies stressed the pronounced correlation of EGR-1 and human cancers. Nevertheless, the intricate mechanisms of cancer-reduce EGR-1 alteration still poorly characterized. In the review, we evaluated the effects of EGR-1 in tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion and tumor microenvironment, and then, we dwell on the intricate signaling pathways that EGR-1 involved in. The aberrantly expressed of EGR-1 in cancers are expected to provide a new cancer therapy strategy or a new marker for assessing treatment efficacy.

FGFR3 promotes the growth and malignancy of melanoma by influencing EMT and the phosphorylation of ERK, AKT, and EGFR.||||||||Overexpression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) has been linked to tumor progression in many types of cancer. The role of FGFR3 in melanoma remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to uncover the role of FGFR3 in the growth and metastasis of melanoma.||||FGFR3 knockdown and overexpression strategies were employed to investigate the effects of FGFR3 on colony formation, cell apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and in vitro invasion, along with the growth and metastasis of melanoma in a xenografts mouse model. The protein expression levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), protein kinase B (AKT), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were determined by Western blot analysis.||||The mRNA expression of FGFR3 was higher in melanoma tissues than normal healthy tissues. FGFR3 expression in cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) tissues was positively correlated with the Breslow thickness and lymph node metastasis. In A357 cells, knockdown of the FGFR3 gene decreased the colony formation ability, cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, but increased the caspase 3 activity and the apoptosis rate; overexpression of FGFR3 increased the colony formation ability, cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, but decreased the caspase 3 activity and apoptosis rates. FGFR3 knockdown also upregulated E-cadherin, downregulated N-cadherin and vimentin, and decreased the phosphorylation levels of ERK, AKT, and EGFR. In the MCC xenografts mice, knockdown of FGFR3 decreased tumor growth and metastasis.||||FGFR3, which is highly expressed in CMM tissues, is correlated with increased Breslow thickness and lymph node metastasis. FGFR3 promotes melanoma growth, metastasis, and EMT behaviors, likely by affecting the phosphorylation levels of ERK, AKT, and EGFR.

Data were extracted from study reports which reported IL-6 levels in relevance to RCC prognosis and random-effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate IL-6 levels, percentage of patients with high IL-6 levels, and hazard/odds ratios between high and low IL-6 levels in survival outcomes.||||22 studies (1976 patients; age 59.9 years [95% confidence interval (CI) 58.0, 61.8]; 33% [95% CI 29, 36] females) were included. IL-6 levels in RCC patients ranged from 8.9 ± 13-193 ± 101 picograms per milliliter (pg/ml) which were higher than those of normal healthy individuals (mean difference 13.96 pg/ml [95% CI: 1.52, 26.40]; p = 0.03). Percentage of RCC patients with high IL-6 levels was 48.98% [95% CI 42.94, 55.03] and this rate was greater in advanced (51.73% [95% CI 45.94, 57.53]) than in local (40.75% [95% CI 26.23, 55.27]) RCC. Survival was longer in patients with low compared to high IL-6 levels (MD 9.65 months [95% CI 5.01, 14.29]; p < 0.0006 and hazard ratio 3.03 [95% CI 2.37, 3.70]). Treatment response rate was significantly higher in patients with low IL-6 than high IL-6 levels (odds ratio 5.11 [95% CI 2.21, 11.77]; p < 0.00001). There was a strong correlation between IL-6 and c-reactive protein levels (correlation coefficient 0.622 [95% CI 0.431, 0.760]; p = 0.00001).||||IL-6 levels are much variable in RCC patients. High levels of IL-6 in RCC patients are associated with poor survival.

Inhibitors of HSP90 in melanoma.||||||||HSP90 (heat shock protein 90) is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone involved in a proper folding and maturation of hundreds of proteins. HSP90 is abundantly expressed in cancer, including melanoma. HSP90 client proteins are the key oncoproteins of several signaling pathways controlling melanoma development, progression and response to therapy. A number of natural and synthetic compounds of different chemical structures and binding sites within HSP90 have been identified as selective HSP90 inhibitors. The majority of HSP90-targeting agents affect N-terminal ATPase activity of HSP90. In contrast to N-terminal inhibitors, agents interacting with the middle and C-terminal domains of HSP90 do not induce HSP70-dependent cytoprotective response. Several inhibitors of HSP90 were tested against melanoma in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, providing evidence that these agents can be considered either as single or complementary therapeutic strategy. This review summarizes current knowledge on the role of HSP90 protein in cancer with focus on melanoma, and provides an overview of structurally different HSP90 inhibitors that are considered as potential therapeutics for melanoma treatment.

ESR1 mutations in breast cancer.||||||||The acquisition of ligand-independent ESR1 mutations during aromatase inhibitor therapy in metastatic estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer is a common mechanism of hormonal therapy resistance. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that ESR1 mutations can preexist in primary tumors and can be enriched during metastasis. Furthermore, ESR1 mutations express a unique transcriptional profile that favors tumor progression, suggesting that selected ESR1 mutations may influence metastasis. Several groups have used sensitive detection methods using patient liquid biopsies to track ESR1 or truncal somatic mutations to predict treatment outcome and tumor progression, and some of these techniques may eventually be used to guide sequential treatment options in patients. Further development and standardization of mutation tracking in circulating tumor DNA is ongoing. Clinically, patients with ESR1 mutations derive clinical benefit when treated with fulvestrant and CDK4/6-targeted therapies, but the development of more potent selective ER degraders and/or new targeted biotherapies are needed to overcome the endocrine-resistant phenotype of ESR1 mutant-bearing tumors. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of resistance and dissemination of ESR1 mutations as well as the detection methods for ESR1 mutation tracking, newly discovered potential therapeutic targets, and the clinical implications and treatment options for treating patients with ESR1 mutant-bearing tumors.

Update on KMT2B-Related Dystonia.||||||||To summarize the molecular and clinical findings of KMT2B-related dystonia (DYT-KMT2B), a newly identified genetic dystonia syndrome.||||Since first described in 2016, 66 different KMT2B-affecting variants, encompassing a set of frameshift, nonsense, splice-site, missense, and deletion mutations, have been reported in 76 patients. Most mutations are de novo and expected to mediate epigenetic dysregulation by inducing KMT2B haploinsufficiency. DYT-KMT2B is characterized phenotypically by limb-onset childhood dystonia that tends to spread progressively, resulting in generalized dystonia with cranio-cervical involvement. Co-occuring signs such as intellectual disability are frequently observed. Sustained response to deep brain stimulation (DBS), including restoration of independent ambulation, is seen in 93% (27/29) of patients. DYT-KMT2B is emerging as a prevalent monogenic dystonia. Childhood-onset dystonia presentations should prompt a search for KMT2B mutations, preferentially via next-generation-sequencing and genomic-array technologies, to enable specific counseling and treatment. Prospective multicenter studies are desirable to establish KMT2B mutational status as a DBS outcome predictor.

A negative feedback regulatory loop between miR-138 and TP53 is mediated by USP10.||||||||TP53 is a critical tumor suppressor. In approximately 50% of human cancers the TP53 gene is either lost or mutated. The expression level of TP53 in the cells is tightly controlled by a fine-tune machinery, mainly through the Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination pathway. On the other side, the ubiquitinated TP53 could be reversed and stabilized by USP7 and USP10, to keep the amount of TP53 in check. MicroRNAs can negatively regulate TP53 expression levels through direct targeting or positively regulate TP53 function through the repression of negative regulators of TP53. Here we report that microRNA-138 controls TP53 expression by directly targeting USP10. Furthermore, TP53 represses microRNA-138 expression, forming a negative feedback regulatory loop. This finding adds another layer of complexity to the TP53 network.

The Human Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 2 Ion Channel Modulates ROS Through Nrf2.||||||||Transient receptor potential melastatin channel subfamily member 2 (TRPM2) has an essential role in protecting cell viability through modulation of oxidative stress. TRPM2 is highly expressed in cancer. When TRPM2 is inhibited, mitochondria are dysfunctional, ROS levels are increased, and cell viability is reduced. Here, the importance of NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) in TRPM2-mediated suppression of oxidant stress was explored. In TRPM2 depleted cells, antioxidant cofactors glutathione, NADPH, and NADH were significantly reduced. Cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of Nrf2 and of IQGAP1, a modulator of Nrf2 stability regulated by intracellular calcium, were decreased. Antioxidant enzymes transcriptionally regulated by Nrf2 and involved in GSH, NADPH, and NADH generation were significantly lower including PRX1 and PRX3, GPX4, GSTP1, GCLC, and MTHFD2. The glutamine pathway leading to GSH production was suppressed, and ATP and GTP levels were impaired. Reconstitution with wild type TRPM2 or Nrf2, but not TRPM2 pore mutant E960D, rescued expression of enzymes downstream of Nrf2 and restored GSH and GTP. Cell viability, ROS, NADPH, NADH, and ATP levels were fully rescued by TRPM2 and partially by Nrf2. These data show that TRPM2 maintains cell survival following oxidative stress through modulation of antioxidant pathways and cofactors regulated by Nrf2.

Indeed, PIN1 positively regulated the expression of EGFR in A375R cells and led to activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Importantly, PLX4032, when used in combination with ATRA, an inhibitor of PIN1, reduced EGFR expression, and consequently reduced cell viability and anchorage-independent growth of A375R cells compared to PLX4032 alone. Furthermore, co-treatment with ATRA and PLX4032 increased cleaved PARP and DNA fragmentation in A375R cells.||||PIN1 plays an important role in the development of PLX4032 resistance through up-regulation of EGFR expression.

Roles of Wnt7a in embryo development, tissue homeostasis, and human diseases.||||||||Human Wnt family comprises 19 proteins which are critical to embryo development and tissue homeostasis. Binding to different frizzled (FZD) receptor, Wnt7a initiates both β-catenin dependent pathway, and β-catenin independent pathways such as PI3K/Akt, RAC/JNK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. In the embryo, Wnt7a plays a crucial role in cerebral cortex development, synapse formation, and central nervous system vasculature formation and maintenance. Wnt7a is also involved in the development of limb and female reproductive system. Wnt7a mutation leads to human limb malformations and animal female reproductive system defects. Wnt7a is implicated in homeostasis maintenance of skeletal muscle, cartilage, cornea and hair follicle, and Wnt7a treatment may be potentially applied in skeletal muscle dystrophy, corneal damage, wound repair, and hair follicle regeneration. Wnt7a plays dual roles in human tumors. Wnt7a is downregulated in lung cancers, functioning as a tumor suppressor, however, it is upregulated in several other malignancies such as ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and glioma, acting as a tumor promoter. Moreover, Wnt7a overexpression is associated with inflammation and fibrosis, but its roles need to be further investigated.

The imbalance of oxidant and antioxidant states induces oxidative stress within a cell. Redox regulation and oxidative stress are closely related to survival and proliferation of stem cells, cancer cells, and cancer stem cells. Peroxiredoxin 4, a typical endoplasmic reticulum-resident 2-Cys antioxidant of peroxiredoxins, can fine-tune hydrogen peroxide catabolism which affects cell survival by affecting redox balance, oxidative protein folding, and regulation of hydrogen peroxide signaling. Recent studies revealed the overexpression of peroxiredoxin 4 in several kinds of cancers, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer. And it has been demonstrated that peroxiredoxin 4 causally contributes to tumorigenesis, therapeutic resistance, metastasis, and recurrence of tumors. In this article, the characteristics of peroxiredoxin 4 in physiological functions and the cancer-related research progress of mammalian peroxiredoxin 4 is reviewed.

Divergent roles of Plexin D1 in cancer.||||||||Plexin D1 belongs to a family of transmembrane proteins called plexins. It was characterized as a receptor for semaphorins and is known to be essential for axonal guidance and vascular patterning. Mutations in Plexin D1 have been implicated in pathologic conditions such as truncus arteriosus and Möbius syndrome. Emerging data show that expression of Plexin D1 is deregulated in several cancers; it can support tumor development by aiding in tumor metastasis and EMT; and conversely, it can act as a dependence receptor and stimulate cell death in the absence of its canonical ligand, semaphorin 3E. The role of Plexin D1 in tumor development and progression is thereby garnering research interest for its potential as a biomarker and as a therapeutic target. In this review, we describe its discovery, structure, mutations, role(s) in cancer, and therapeutic potential.

GLS2 is protumorigenic in breast cancers.||||||||Many types of cancers have a well-established dependence on glutamine metabolism to support survival and growth, a process linked to glutaminase 1 (GLS) isoforms. Conversely, GLS2 variants often have tumor-suppressing activity. Triple-negative (TN) breast cancer (testing negative for estrogen, progesterone, and Her2 receptors) has elevated GLS protein levels and reportedly depends on exogenous glutamine and GLS activity for survival. Despite having high GLS levels, we verified that several breast cancer cells (including TN cells) express endogenous GLS2, defying its role as a bona fide tumor suppressor. Moreover, ectopic GLS2 expression rescued cell proliferation, TCA anaplerosis, redox balance, and mitochondrial function after GLS inhibition by the small molecule currently in clinical trials CB-839 or GLS knockdown of GLS-dependent cell lines. In several cell lines, GLS2 knockdown decreased cell proliferation and glutamine-linked metabolic phenotypes. Strikingly, long-term treatment of TN cells with another GLS-exclusive inhibitor bis-2'-(5-phenylacetamide-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES) selected for a drug-resistant population with increased endogenous GLS2 and restored proliferative capacity. GLS2 was linked to enhanced in vitro cell migration and invasion, mesenchymal markers (through the ERK-ZEB1-vimentin axis under certain conditions) and in vivo lung metastasis. Of concern, GLS2 amplification or overexpression is linked to an overall, disease-free and distant metastasis-free worse survival prognosis in breast cancer. Altogether, these data establish an unforeseen role of GLS2 in sustaining tumor proliferation and underlying metastasis in breast cancer and provide an initial framework for exploring GLS2 as a novel therapeutic target.

Mutations in CUL4B result in Cabezas syndrome (CS). Male CS patients present with dysmorphic, neuropsychiatric, genitourinary, and endocrine abnormalities. Heterozygous CS females are clinically asymptomatic. LAMP2 mutations cause Danon disease (DD). Cardiomyopathy is a dominant feature of DD present in both males and heterozygous females. No monogenic phenotypes have been associated with mutations in ATP1B4, TMEM255A, and ZBTB33 genes. To facilitate diagnostics and counseling in CS and DD families, we present a female DD patient with a de novo Alu-mediated Xq24 rearrangement causing a deletion encompassing CUL4B, LAMP2, and also the other three neighboring genes. Typical to females heterozygous for CUL4B mutations, the patient was CS asymptomatic, however, presented with extremely skewed X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) ratios in peripheral white blood cells. As a result of the likely selection against CUL4B deficient clones, only minimal populations (~3%) of LAMP2 deficient leukocytes were identified by flow cytometry. On the contrary, myocardial LAMP2 protein expression suggested random XCI. We demonstrate that contiguous CUL4B and LAMP2 loss-of-function copy number variations occur and speculate that male patients carrying similar defects could present with features of both CS and DD.

Retinoblastoma binding protein 4 up-regulation is correlated with hepatic metastasis and poor prognosis in colon cancer patients.||||||||Retinoblastoma binding protein 4 (RBBP4) plays an essential role in the development of multiple cancers. However, its relationship with prognosis in colon cancer and colon cancer hepatic metastasis has not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between RBBP4 expression and prognosis of colon cancer patients and to evaluate RBBP4 as a new prognostic marker in these patients.||||Eighty colon cancer patients underwent surgical resection of the colon were enrolled. Among them, forty colon cancer patients suffered with hepatic metastasis. The colon cancer tissues, para-colon cancer tissues, and hepatic metastatic cancer tissues were collected from the pathological department for further analysis. The expression of RBBP4 proteins was examined by immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinicopathological parameters. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was used to validate the expression and explore its relationship with clinical characteristics.||||RBBP4 was up-regulated in the colon cancer tissues compared with the para-colon cancer tissues. The analysis of TCGA database verified the upregulation of RBBP4 in the colon cancer tissues and RBBP4 overexpression was correlated with nerve invasion and poor outcomes of chemotherapy. Moreover, the positive rate of RBBP4 expression in 40 colon cancer patients with hepatic metastasis was higher in the hepatic metastatic cancer tissues (39/40, 97.5%) than in the colon cancer tissues (26/40, 65.0%). Our clinicopathological analysis showed that RBBP4 expression was significantly correlated with vascular invasion, hepatic metastasis, and lymph node involvement (all P < 0.05). Additionally, the survival analysis demonstrated that RBBP4 over-expression was correlated with poor prognosis.||||RBBP4 was upregulated in the colon cancer. RBBP4 may be a novel predictor for poor prognosis of colon cancer and colon cancer hepatic metastasis.

Glioma cells were transfected with ctrl vector, pcDNA-GAS5, siRNA ctrl (siNC) or GSTM3 siRNA and the effects of lncRNA GAS5 and GSTM3 on the proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of glioma cells were detected by CCK-8 assay, transwell assay and Caspase 3/7 activity assay, respectively.||||The expression of lncRNA GAS5 was significantly decreased in glioma cell lines U251 and U87 compared with normal glial cells HEB (p < 0.01). In addition, overexpression of lncRNA GAS5 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of U251 and U87 cells, and promoted cell apoptosis as demonstrated by the increased activity of Caspase 3/7. Furthermore, GSTM3 was predicted as a target gene of lncRNA GAS5 by bioinformatics analysis and its expression was increased in glioma cells compared with the normal cells as indicated by western blotting and RT-qPCR experimental results. Silencing of GSTM3 with GSTM3 siRNA decreased the proliferation, migration and invasion but increased the apoptosis of glioma cell lines U251 and U87, which was similar to that the effect lncRNA GAS5 over-expression.||||lncRNA GAS5 can effectively inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells and promote cell apoptosis through targeting GSTM3 expression.

Monogenic Forms of Diabetes Mellitus.||||||||In addition to the common types of diabetes mellitus, two major monogenic diabetes forms exist. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) represents a heterogenous group of monogenic, autosomal dominant diseases. MODY accounts for 1-2% of all diabetes cases, and it is not just underdiagnosed but often misdiagnosed to type 1 or type 2 diabetes. More than a dozen MODY genes have been identified to date, and their molecular classification is of great importance in the correct treatment decision and in the judgment of the prognosis. The most prevalent subtypes are HNF1A, GCK, and HNF4A. Genetic testing for MODY has changed recently due to the technological advancements, as contrary to the sequential testing performed in the past, nowadays all MODY genes can be tested simultaneously by next-generation sequencing. The other major group of monogenic diabetes is neonatal diabetes mellitus which can be transient or permanent, and often the diabetes is a part of a syndrome. It is a severe monogenic disease appearing in the first 6 months of life. The hyperglycemia usually requires insulin. There are two forms, permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) and transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM). In TNDM, the diabetes usually reverts within several months but might relapse later in life. The incidence of NDM is 1:100,000-1:400,000 live births, and PNDM accounts for half of the cases. Most commonly, neonatal diabetes is caused by mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes encoding the ATP-dependent potassium channel of the β cell. Neonatal diabetes has experienced a quick and successful transition into the clinical practice since the discovery of the molecular background. In case of both genetic diabetes groups, recent guidelines recommend genetic testing.

Immunohistochemical expression of HIK1083 and MUC6 in endometrial carcinomas.||||||||Gastric-type endocervical adenocarcinoma (EA) is characterised by aggressive behaviour and pathogenesis independent of human papillomavirus infection. Because of its morphology and frequent mutation-pattern expression of p53, gastric-type EA may be confused with several types of endometrial carcinoma, particularly in biopsy and curettage specimens. HIK1083 and MUC6 are immunohistochemical markers used to support a diagnosis of gastric-type EA; however, the rates of expression of these markers in endometrial tumours are largely unknown. We therefore aimed to assess the expression of HIK1083 and MUC6 in a cohort of different types of endometrial carcinoma.||||Ninety-one endometrial carcinomas (56 endometrioid, 16 clear cell, and 19 serous) from 91 patients treated with hysterectomy were included. A representative tumour block from each case was used for immunohistochemical staining with HIK1083 and MUC6. The percentage of stained cells (0-100%) and average staining intensity (weak, moderate, and strong) were recorded for both markers. None of 91 cases expressed HIK1083. In contrast, 66% (60/91) of cases showed at least focal expression of MUC6; importantly, 54 of 60 (90%) positive cases showed moderate or strong staining. Five of 60 (8%) cases showed MUC6 staining in ≥50% of tumour cells. Endometrioid tumours (49/56, 88%) were more likely to express MUC6 than cases of clear cell (1/16, 6%) or serous (10/19, 53%) carcinoma.||||Endometrial carcinoma often expresses MUC6. In contrast, HIK1083 is consistently negative, and thus, when positive, is a more reliable marker for distinguishing gastric-type EA from some of its endometrial mimics.

We describe an autosomal recessive complex neurological disorder affecting consanguineous kindred. All four affected individuals, born at term following normal pregnancies, had mild to severe intellectual disability, spastic quadriplegia, scoliosis and epilepsy in most, with no dysmorphic features. Brain MRI findings were suggestive of leukodystrophy, with abnormal hyperintense signal in the periventricular perioccipital region and thinning of the body of corpus callosum. Notably, all affected individuals were asymptomatic at early infancy and developed normally until the age of 8-18 months, when deterioration ensued. Homozygosity mapping identified a single 8.7 Mb disease-associated locus on chromosome 1q41-1q42.13 between rs1511695 and rs537250 (two-point LOD score 2.1). Whole exome sequencing, validated through Sanger sequencing, identified within this locus a single disease-associated homozygous variant in DEGS1, encoding C4-dihydroceramide desaturase, an enzyme of the ceramide synthesis pathway. The missense variant, segregating within the family as expected for recessive heredity, affects an evolutionary-conserved amino acid of all isoforms of DEGS1 (c.656A>G, c.764A>G; p.(N219S), p.(N255S)) and was not found in a homozygous state in ExAC and gnomAD databases or in 300 ethnically matched individuals. Lipidomcs analysis of whole blood of affected individuals demonstrated augmented levels of dihydroceramides, dihydrosphingosine, dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate and dihydrosphingomyelins with reduced levels of ceramide, sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate and monohexosylceramides, as expected in malfunction of C4-dihydroceramide desaturase. Thus, we describe a sphingolipidosis causing a severe regressive neurological disease.

Retinol dehydrogenase 10 promotes metastasis of glioma cells via the transforming growth factor-β/SMAD signaling pathway.||||||||Glioma is the most common primary malignant tumor in the central nervous system. Because of the resistance of glioma to chemoradiotherapy and its aggressive growth, the survival rate of patients with glioma has not improved. This study aimed to disclose the effect of retinol dehydrogenase 10 (RDH10) on the migration and invasion of glioma cells, and to explore the potential mechanism.||||Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine the expression levels of RDH10 in healthy glial cells and glioma cells. Human glioma cell strains, U87 and U251, were infected with negative control or RDH10-interfering lentiviruses. RT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to determine the knockdown efficiency. Scratch and transwell assays were used to assess cell migration and invasion after RDH10 knockdown. Finally, changes in transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/SMAD signaling pathway-related expression were examined by Western blotting. Differences between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance.||||RDH10 was highly expressed in glioma cells. Compared with the control group, RDH10 knockdown significantly reduced RDH10 messenger RNA and protein expression levels in U87 and U251 glioma cells (U87: 1.00 ± 0.08 vs. 0.22 ± 0.02, t = 16.55, P < 0.001; U251: 1.00 ± 0.17 vs. 0.39 ± 0.01, t = 6.30, P < 0.001).

Leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 4 (LGR4) is a novel target of miR-34a identified first in retinal pigment epithelial cells. In this study, we sought to evaluate the interaction of miR-34a and LGR4 in uveal melanoma and its downstream mechanisms.||||The expression of LGR4, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated factors, and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) in uveal melanoma cells was assessed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis. MicroRNA-34a mimic molecules, LGR4 small interfering RNA (siRNA), or MMP2-specific siRNA were transiently transfected into uveal melanoma cells. In vitro scratch and Transwell assays were used to evaluate the migratory and invasive potential of the resultant uveal melanoma cells.||||LGR4 is upregulated in uveal melanoma cells. Introduction of miR-34a significantly decreased the expression level of LGR4. Transfection with miR-34a or knockdown of LGR4 attenuated the aggressiveness of uveal melanoma cells. In addition, there was a decrease in the expression of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, vimentin, and Snail following miR-34a introduction or knockdown of LGR4. Finally, MMP2 was found to be a downstream effector for miR-34a and LGR4 that regulates the migration and invasion of uveal melanoma cells.||||MicroRNA-34a negatively controls LGR4, thereby inhibiting the migration and invasion of uveal melanoma cells. Ultimately, both miR-34a and LGR4 impact the aggressiveness of uveal melanoma with alterations in the markers of the EMT. MMP2 is a downstream effector that influences the metastasis seen with uveal melanoma cells.

Cx43 plays key role in mammary gland development and differentiation and its spatio-temporal perturbation contributes to tumorigenesis. Thus, Cx43 acts as a breast tumor-suppressor. Signaling pathways and phenotypes downstream of Cx43 mRNA loss/mis-localization in breast cells have been well-studied. However, axes parallel to Cx43 loss are less understood. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous non-coding RNAs that repress translation and circularRNAs (circRNAs) are a class of endogenous RNAs that originate from RNA splicing and act as miRNA "sponges". CircRNAs and miRNAs are dysregulated in cancers and are highly abundant and stable in the circulation. Thus, they present as attractive liquid biopsy cancer biomarkers. Here, an axis for Cx43 mRNA-circRNAs-miRNAs interactions along BC initiation (denoted by loss of breast epithelial polarity and development of hyperplastic phenotypes) is proposed to potentially serve as a signature biomarker toward BC early-onset detection and prevention.

ANGPTL6-mediated angiogenesis promotes alpha fetoprotein-producing gastric cancer progression.||||||||Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing gastric cancer (AFPGC) is regarded as a rare but highly malignant gastric adenocarcinoma subtype and its clinic pathological presentation mimics hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the underlying mechanism of this disease remains elusive. The level of ANGPTL6 in AFPGC cell lines is much higher than that of common types of gastric cancer cells. A high level of ANGPTL6 confers a poor prognosis and is correlated with the expression of CD34 (an endothelial cell marker). ANGPTL6 promotes endothelial cell migration and tube formation, Moreover, ANGPTL6 knockdown inhibits cancer cell apoptosis and invasiveness. Mechanistically, ANGPTL6 activates the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways. Treatment of ERK1/2 or AKT inhibitor can attenuated cell migration and tube formation. ANGPTL6 loss results in tumor growth in vivo. Our study revealed that ANGPTL6 is an important driver gene of angiogenesis in AFPGC development. These findings provide not only an effective biomarker for diagnosis but also an attractive therapeutic target for use in AFPGC patients.

Inhibition of lung cancer cells and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signal transduction by ectonucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase-7 (ENTPD7).||||||||The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of ectonucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase-7 (ENTPD7) on lung cancer cells.||||The expression characteristics of ENTPD7 and its effect on the survival of lung cancer patients were analyzed by referring to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Streptavidin-peroxidase (SP) staining was performed to detect the ENTPD7 protein in tumor tissues and adjacent tissues. Plasmid transfection technology was also applied to silence ENTPD7 gene. Crystal violet staining and flow cytometry were performed to determine cell proliferation and apoptosis. Tumor-bearing nude mice model was established to investigate the effect of sh-ENTPD7 on tumors.||||The results showed that patients with low levels of ENTPD7 had higher survival rates. ENTPD7 was up-regulated in lung cancer tissues and cells. Down-regulation of the expression of ENTPD7 inhibited proliferation but promoted apoptosis of lung cancer cell. Silencing ENTPD7 also inhibited the expression levels of Ras and Raf proteins and the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Tumor-bearing nude mice experiments showed that silencing ENTPD7 had an inhibitory effect on lung cancer cells.||||ENTPD7 was overexpressed in lung cancer cells. Down-regulating ENTPD7 could inhibit lung cancer cell proliferation and promote apoptosis via inhibiting the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.

SOX4 is activated by C-MYC in prostate cancer.||||||||Although MYC proto-oncogene (C-MYC) amplification has been consistently reported to be a potential marker for prostate cancer (PCa) progression and prognosis, the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of C-MYC protein expression remains controversial. Overexpression of SOX4 has been shown to play important roles in multiple cancers including PCa. However, the link between these two critical genetic aberrations is unclear. In the current study, we showed that C-MYC was overexpressed in 16.2% (17/105) of Chinese patients with localized PCa. Overexpression of C-MYC was significantly associated with high Gleason scores (P = 0.012) and high Ki67 labeling index (P = 0.005). C-MYC overexpression was correlated with cancer-related mortality and suggested to be an unfavorable prognostic factor in Chinese PCa patients (P = 0.018). Overexpression of C-MYC is associated with SOX4 overexpression in PCa tissues. Notably, SOX4 is a direct target gene of C-MYC; C-MYC activates SOX4 expression via binding to its promoter. In addition, Co-IP analysis demonstrated a physical interaction between C-MYC and SOX4 protein in PCa cells. Clinically, C-MYC+/SOX4+ characterized poor prognosis in a subset of PCa patients. In total, C-MYC overexpression may contribute to PCa progression by activating SOX4. Our findings highlight an important role of C-MYC/SOX4 in PCa progression in a subset of PCa patients.

Up-regulation of SPC25 promotes breast cancer.||||||||In this study, expression of the SPC25 gene was characterized in breast cancer (BC), and its effects on BC development and progression, functions in BC cells, and potential underlying mechanisms were examined. Data from TCGAportal and FIREBROWSE indicated that SPC25 was upregulated in BC tissues compared to normal tissues, and CANCERTOOL indicated that higher SPC25 mRNA levels were associated with increased probability of recurrence and poorer survival in BC patients. BC patients with higher SPC25 expression displayed shorter distant metastasis-free survival, relapse-free survival, and overall survival. Colony formation and CCK-8 experiments confirmed that SPC25 promoted proliferation of BC cells. Single-cell analysis indicated that SPC25 is associated with cell cycle regulation, DNA damage and repair, and BC cell proliferation. SPC25 knockdown suppressed proliferation of BC cells. MiRNAs, circRNAs, RNA-binding proteins, transcription factors, and immune factors that might interact with SPC25 mRNA to promote BC were also identified. These findings suggest that SPC25 levels are higher in more malignant BC subtypes and are associated with poor prognosis in BC patients. In addition, DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and transcription factors inhibitor treatments targeting SPC25 might improve survival in BC patients.

PAK1 promotes proliferation, migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma by facilitating EMT via directly up-regulating Snail.||||||||Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary cause of cancer mortality. PAK1 plays key roles in many types of cancers. However, the role of PAK1 in HCC is not clear.||||qRT-PCR and Western blotting were used to determine expressions of PAK1, Snail and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins. Luciferase reporter assay was used to measure the interaction between PAK1 and Snail. Wound healing, transwell, colony formation assays and flow cytometry were used to assess cell migration, invasion, proliferation and apoptosis. Mouse tumor xenograft model was used to determine the effect of PAK1 on tumor growth in vivo.||||PAK1 and Snail were up-regulated in HCC cells. PAK1 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and increased apoptosis of HCC cells. PAK1 knockdown also inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, PAK1 promoted EMT by targeting Snail. Knockdown of PAK1 could up-regulate pro-apoptotic proteins but down-regulate proliferation-related proteins via suppressing β-catenin signaling pathway.||||PAK1 promotes EMT process by increasing Snail, and facilitates progression of HCC by activating β-catenin pathway.
