Association Between Radiation Tolerance of Lymphocytes and Clinical Outcomes in Cervical Cancer.||||||||This study evaluated whether the lymphocyte tolerance factor (LTF) was an indicator of radiation tolerance of lymphocytes (RTL) using the relative lymphocyte count (RLC), and considering clinical outcomes.||||A total of 92 cervical cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) were analysed. RLC0 was pre-treatment RLC, and RLC1, and RLC2 were at the first and second week of CCRT, respectively. LTF1 was RLC1:RLC2. LTF2 was the dimension of the convex or concave shape comprising the three RLC vertexes. Patients were divided into three groups: good RTL group, low LTF1; moderate RTL group, high LTF1 and low LTF2; and poor RTL group, high LTF1 and high LTF2.||||Patients with good tumour response to radiotherapy were mostly included in the good RTL group than in the other groups. The poor RTL group had lower 3-year progression-free survival (57.1% vs. 83.8% and 82%, p=0.01) and 5-year disease-specific survival (71.8% vs. 90.4% and 94.9%, p=0.062) rates than the moderate and good RTL groups. Multivariate analyses showed that poor RTL was a significant survival predictor.||||The poor RTL group according to LTF is a potential predictor of clinical outcome.

Novel discovery of Averrhoa bilimbi ethanolic leaf extract in the stimulation of brown fat differentiation program in combating diet-induced obesity.||||||||Brown adipocytes are known to promote energy expenditure and limit weight gain to combat obesity. Averrhoa bilimbi, locally called belimbing buluh (DBB), is mainly used as an ethnomedicine in the treatment of metabolic disorders including diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity. The present study aims to investigate the browning activity on white adipocytes by A. bilimbi leaf extract and to evaluate the potential mechanisms.||||Ethanolic leaf extract of A. bilimbi was exposed to Myf5 lineage precursor cells to stimulate adipocyte differentiation. Protein expressions of brown adipocyte markers were determined through high content screening analysis and validated through western blotting. Mito Stress Test assay was conducted to evaluate the cellular oxygen consumption rate upon A. bilimbi treatment.||||A. bilimbi ethanolic leaf extract exhibited an adipogenesis effect similar to a PPARgamma agonist. It also demonstrated brown adipocyte differentiation in myoblastic Myf5-positive precursor cells. Expression of UCP1 and PRDM16 were induced. The basal metabolic rate and respiratory capacity of mitochondria were increased upon A. bilimbi treatment.||||The findings suggest that Averrhoa bilimbi ethanolic leaf extract induces adipocyte browning through PRDM16 activation and enhances mitochondria activity due to UCP1 up-regulation.

ARABIDOPSIS NITRATE REGULATED 1 acts as a negative modulator of seed germination by activating ABI3 expression.||||||||Seed germination is a crucial transition point in plant life and is tightly regulated by environmental conditions through the coordination of two phytohormones, gibberellin and abscisic acid (ABA). To avoid unfavorable conditions, plants have evolved safeguard mechanisms for seed germination. The present contribution reports a novel function of the Arabidopsis MCM1/AGAMOUS/DEFICIENS/SRF(MADS)-box transcription factor ARABIDOPSIS NITRATE REGULATED 1 (ANR1) in seed germination. ANR1 knockout mutant is insensitive to ABA, salt and osmotic stress during the seed germination and early seedling development stages, whereas ANR1-overexpressing lines are hypersensitive. ANR1 is responsive to ABA and abiotic stresses and upregulates the expression of ABA Intolerant (ABI)3 to suppress seed germination. ANR1 and ABI3 have similar expression pattern during seed germination. Genetically, ABI3 acts downstream of ANR1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and yeast-one-hybrid assays showed that ANR1 could bind to the ABI3 promoter to regulate its expression. In addition, ANR1 acts synergistically with AGL21 to suppress seed germination in response to ABA as evidenced by anr1 agl21 double mutant. Taken together, the results herein demonstrate that the ANR1 plays an important role in regulating seed germination and early postgermination growth. ANR1 and AGL21 together constitutes a safeguard mechanism for seed germination to avoid unfavorable conditions.

Embryonic expression of GINS members in the development of the mammalian nervous system.||||||||The GINS (Go, Ichi, Nii, and San) complex contains four protein subunits (PSF1, PSF2, PSF3, and SLD5) and has been identified as a factor essential for the initiation and elongation stages of the DNA replication process. A previous study indicated that PSF2 participated in the developing central nervous system (CNS) of Xenopus laevis. However, the expression and function of GINS members in the mammalian developing nervous system remains unclear. Here, we examined the expression of GINS members in mice during nervous system development via immunofluorescence staining. At the beginning of neural development, PSF1 and SLD5 were highly expressed in neuroepithelial stem cells (NSCs) of the inner surface of neural tube (NT) and overlapped with proliferation marker Ki67. After entering the mid- and late-phase of neural development, PSF1 and SLD5 changed their regions of expression. These genes were highly expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) progenitors, but they showed no overlap with Ki67 positive cells. Instead, a reduction of SLD5 expression promoted neuronal differentiation and maturation in the late-phase. PSF2 and PSF3 showed no tissue-specificity. PSF2 was constitutively and highly expressed whereas PSF3 was expressed at very low levels during neural development. In this study, we demonstrated variations in proteins and expression regions of the GINS members during mammalian CNS development and revealed a correlation between GINS expression and cell proliferation. Furthermore, we have suggested a novel function of GINS member SLD5, which regulates the differentiation of neural stem/progenitors.

Role of soluble endoglin in BMP9 signaling.||||||||Endoglin (ENG) is a coreceptor of the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) family signaling complex, which is highly expressed on endothelial cells and plays a key role in angiogenesis. Its extracellular domain can be cleaved and released into the circulation as soluble ENG (sENG). High circulating levels of sENG contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia (PE). Circulating bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9), a vascular quiescence and endothelial-protective factor, binds sENG with high affinity, but how sENG participates in BMP9 signaling complexes is not fully resolved. sENG was thought to be a ligand trap for BMP9, preventing type II receptor binding and BMP9 signaling. Here we show that, despite cell-surface ENG being a dimer linked by disulfide bonds, sENG purified from human placenta and plasma from PE patients is primarily in a monomeric form. Incubating monomeric sENG with the circulating form of BMP9 (prodomain-bound form) in solution leads to the release of the prodomain and formation of a sENG:BMP9 complex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that binding of sENG to BMP9 does not inhibit BMP9 signaling. Indeed, the sENG:BMP9 complex signals with comparable potency and specificity to BMP9 on human primary endothelial cells. The full signaling activity of the sENG:BMP9 complex required transmembrane ENG. This study confirms that rather than being an inhibitory ligand trap, increased circulating sENG might preferentially direct BMP9 signaling via cell-surface ENG at the endothelium. This is important for understanding the role of sENG in the pathobiology of PE and other cardiovascular diseases.

Mismatch Repair Deficiency in Endometrial Cancer: Immunohistochemistry Staining and Clinical Implications.||||||||DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency is associated with increased risk of developing several types of cancer and is the most common cause of hereditary endometrial cancer. Identification of the microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype in endometrial carcinoma is important given that such tumors are frequent.||||The objective of this study was to assess the utility of immunohistochemistry (IHC), a simple and fast technique, in detecting MSI status in endometrial carcinoma and evaluate the correlation between the MSI phenotype and the various anatomo-clinical parameters.||||IHC expression of 4 markers (MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, and MSH6) was studied. For all IHC markers, a combined score based on the intensity of nuclear labeling and the percentage of labeled cells was defined to establish a score. Correlation between MSI phenotype and different clinicopathologic parameters was evaluated using statistical analysis (software STATA and the Fisher exact test).||||The mean age of the patients was 58.6 years. Positive staining was highly extended (score 3) with 79% to 100% of marked cells. Less than 10% of positive tumor cells were seen in 3% of cases for MSH6 and PMS2. Abnormal MMR IHC was detected in 10 cases (22.22%). Seven tumors showed loss of MLH1/PMS2. The loss of MSH2/MSH6 was observed in 1 case. The loss of MLH1 or PMS2 was seen only in 2 cases. The number of MSI positive status was 10 cases (22.7%). Correlation between clinicopathologic parameters showed MMR deficiency was significantly associated with low-grade tumor and localized stage. There was no positive correlation between age, histologic subtype, or myometrium invasion.||||In summary, detection of DNA MMR deficiencies by IHC can effectively diagnose the MSI phenotype in endometrial carcinoma. Correlation between clinicopathologic parameters showed MMR deficiency was significantly associated with low-grade tumor and localized stage.

Synovial Fluid MicroRNA-210 as a Potential Biomarker for Early Prediction of Osteoarthritis.||||||||Early detection and treatment are critical in the management of osteoarthritis (OA). OA is closely associated with angiogenesis and the inhibition of angiogenesis presents a novel therapeutic approach to reduce inflammation and pain in OA. Recent reports suggest that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have great potential as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis in OA. In this study, we aimed to explore the clinical significance of miR-210 in synovial fluid samples from 10 healthy volunteers and 20 early-stage OA and 20 late-stage OA patients. miR-210 expression was assessed by real-time RT-PCR. VEGF protein levels were examined by ELISA. The results show that miR-210 is significantly upregulated in early-stage OA and late-stage OA patients compared with healthy individuals. Higher levels of VEGF are also found in OA compared with the control. Moreover, miR-210 levels are positively correlated with VEGF levels, suggesting that miR-210 might contribute to OA development through promoting VEGF expression and angiogenesis. In conclusion, upregulation of miR-210 in synovial fluid may occur in the early stage of OA and can be a useful biomarker for early diagnosis of OA.

Ctenopharyngodon Idella STAT3 alleviates autophagy by up-regulating BCL-2 expression.||||||||In mammals, STAT3 (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) plays an absolutely vital role in response to cytokines and growth factors. In mammals, IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway is closely linked to immune response and promotes cell proliferation, survival and metastasis. Some recent studies have already demonstrated that STAT3 regulates autophagy. As a downstream target gene of STAT3, Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) not only participates in regulating apoptosis, but also responds to autophagy. STAT3 regulates autophagy through Bcl-2. In general, the generation of autophagy is always accompanied by the change of apoptosis, and the occurrence of apoptosis is often accompanied by the decreased of cell viability. In grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), LPS-induced autophagy is involved in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, only the relationship between autophagy and cytokines was illustrated, in which the signaling pathways were not discussed. In the present study, we found that the autophagy inducer, Tunicamycin (Tm), can induce C.Idella Kidney cells (CIK) autophagy. When the cells were incubated with the recombinant human IL-6 (rIL-6) for a short period of times, the mRNA expression level of C.Idella IL-6R and STAT3 were increased. At the same time, the number of GFP-LC3 puncta and the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I were both decreased obviously in cells. It indicated that the rIL-6 can significantly alleviate autophagy induced by Tm. We speculated that CiSTAT3 may play a key role in the process. To confirm this hypothesis, we performed a rIL-6 activating CiSTAT3 assay. The result demonstrated that rIL-6 can induce CiSTAT3 to form homologous dimmer. The activated CiSTAT3 regulated the transcription activity of CiBcl-2, finally led to a decrease of autophagy. In addition, when cells were in the state of autophagy, apoptosis was increased and cell viability was decreased. When CiSTAT3 was activated, cell apoptosis weakened and cell viability was increased. The results suggest that CiSTAT3 plays an important role in maintaining the normal physiological process of cells.

PRMT1 activates myogenin transcription via MyoD arginine methylation at R121.||||||||MyoD is a determining transcription factor involved in myogenic cell differentiation. Post translational modifications of MyoD, including phosphorylation and acetylation, can regulate its transcription activity. Inhibition of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) leads to insufficient muscle differentiation. However, little is known about arginine methylation in regulating MyoD activity. Here, we demonstrated that MyoD interacts with PRMT1 via its bHLH domain. MyoD could be methylated by PRMT1 at R121. Moreover, R111 and R121 of MyoD are responsible for MyoD-mediated myogenin gene transcription in C2C12 cells. PRMT1 promotes MyoD-mediated myogenin expression, for which the enzymatic activity of PRMT1 is needed. The arginine methylation of MyoD by PRMT1 enhances its DNA binding activity and transactivation. Our data help to further clarify the molecular mechanism of PRMT1 in regulating muscle cell differentiation and provide a new therapeutic target for diseases caused by the abnormal differentiation of muscle cells.

Myometrial Cells Stimulate Self-Renewal of Endometrial Mesenchymal Stem-Like Cells Through WNT5A/β-Catenin Signaling.||||||||Human endometrium undergoes cycles of proliferation and differentiation throughout the reproductive years of women. The endometrial stem/progenitor cells contribute to this regenerative process. They lie in the basalis layer of the endometrium next to the myometrium. We hypothesized that human myometrial cells provide niche signals regulating the activities of endometrial mesenchymal stem-like cells (eMSCs). In vitro coculture of myometrial cells enhanced the colony-forming and self-renewal ability of eMSCs. The cocultured eMSCs retained their multipotent characteristic and exhibited a greater total cell output when compared with medium alone culture. The expression of active β-catenin in eMSCs increased significantly after coculture with myometrial cells, suggesting activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling. Secretory factors in spent medium from myometrial cell culture produced the same stimulatory effects on eMSCs. The involvement of WNT/β-catenin signaling in self-renewal of eMSCs was confirmed with the use of WNT activator (Wnt3A conditioned medium) and WNT inhibitors (XAV939 and inhibitor of Wnt Production-2 [IWP-2]). The myometrial cells expressed more WNT5A than other WNT ligands. Recombinant WNT5A stimulated whereas anti-WNT5A antibody suppressed the colony formation, self-renewal, and T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF) transcriptional activities of eMSCs. Moreover, eMSCs expressed FZD4 and LRP5. WNT5A is known to activate the canonical WNT signaling in the presence of these receptor components. WNT antagonist, DKK1, binds to LRP5/6. Consistently, DKK1 treatment nullified the stimulatory effect of myometrial cell coculture. In conclusion, our findings show that the myometrial cells are niche components of eMSCs, modulating the self-renewal activity of eMSCs by WNT5A-dependent activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling.

ASC1 is a cell cycle regulator associated with severe and mild forms of myopathy.||||||||Recently, the ASC-1 complex has been identified as a mechanistic link between ALS and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and three mutations of the ASC-1 gene TRIP4 have been associated with SMA or congenital myopathy. Our goal was to define ASC-1 neuromuscular function and the phenotypical spectrum associated with TRIP4 mutations.||||Clinical, molecular, histological and MRI studies in 5 families with 7 novel TRIP4 mutations. FACS and Western blot in patient-derived fibroblasts and muscles and in Trip4 knocked-down C2C12 cells.||||All mutations caused ASC-1 protein depletion. The clinical phenotype was purely myopathic, ranging from lethal neonatal to mild ambulatory adult patients. It included early-onset axial and proximal weakness, scoliosis, rigid spine, dysmorphic facies, cutaneous involvement, respiratory failure and, in the older cases, dilated cardiomyopathy. Muscle biopsies showed multiminicores, nemaline rods, cytoplasmic bodies, caps, central nuclei, rimmed fibers and/or mild endomysial fibrosis. ASC-1 depletion in C2C12 and in patient-derived fibroblasts and muscles caused accelerated proliferation, altered expression of cell cycle proteins and/or shortening of the G0/G1 cell cycle phase leading to cell size reduction.||||Our results expand the phenotypical and molecular spectrum of TRIP4-associated disease to include mild adult forms with or without cardiomyopathy, associate ASC-1 depletion with primary pure muscle involvement and establish TRIP4 as a causative gene for several congenital muscle diseases including nemaline, core, centronuclear or cytoplasmic-body myopathies. They also identify ASC-1 as a novel cell cycle regulator with a key role in cell proliferation, and underline transcriptional co-regulation defects as a novel pathophysiological mechanism.

A renal cell carcinoma with EWSR1-TFE3 fusion gene.||||||||Both EWSR1 and TFE3 are well-known oncogenes. EWSR1 encodes an RNA-binding protein involved in multiple soft tissue tumors, including Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumor, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, soft tissue clear cell sarcoma (malignant melanoma of soft parts), extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, and myxoid liposarcomas. TFE3 regulates both Golgi and lysosomal homeostasis and is rearranged in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), alveolar soft part sarcoma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, and perivascular epitheloid cell tumors (PEComas). In this report, we found a rare case of RCC with a fusion between 5' EWSR1 and 3' TFE3. The fusion product retained most functional motifs of TFE3. The oncogenic mechanism likely involves TFE3 overexpression through its juxtaposition with the regulatory elements of EWSR1 and its translocation to the nucleus, resulting in the deregulation of Golgi and lysosomal homeostasis. This is a second case of RCC containing EWSR1-TFE3 fusion.

CFTR Expression Analysis for Subtyping of Human Pancreatic Cancer Organoids.||||||||Organoid cultures of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have become a promising tool for tumor subtyping and individualized chemosensitivity testing. PDACs have recently been grouped into different molecular subtypes with clinical impact based on cytokeratin-81 (KRT81) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A (HNF1A). However, a suitable antibody for HNF1A is currently unavailable. The present study is aimed at establishing subtyping in PDAC organoids using an alternative marker.||||A PDAC organoid biobank was generated from human primary tumor samples containing 22 lines. Immunofluorescence staining was established and done for 10 organoid lines for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and KRT81. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed for CFTR and HNF1A. A chemotherapeutic drug response analysis was done using gemcitabine, 5-FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan.|||| = 0.001). PDAC subtypes of the primary tumors and the corresponding organoid lines were identical for most of the cases analyzed (6/7). Treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs revealed tendencies but no significant differences regarding drug responses.||||Human PDAC organoids can be classified into known subtypes based on KRT81 and CFTR immunoreactivity. CFTR and HNF1A mRNA levels correlated well. Furthermore, subtype-specific immunoreactivity matched well between PDAC organoids and the respective primary tumor tissue. Subtyping of human PDACs using CFTR might constitute an alternative to HNF1A and should be further investigated.

Expression of P2X receptors in the rat anterior pituitary.||||||||In this study, the distribution patterns of P2X1 to P2X7 receptors in the anterior pituitary cells of rat were studied with single-, double-, and triple-labeling immunofluorescence, combined method of immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization, and Western blot. The results showed that the expression level of the P2X4 receptor protein was highest, followed by P2X5, P2X3, P2X2, P2X6, and P2X7 receptor proteins, but no P2X1 receptor protein was detected. Strong P2X4 receptor-immunoreactivity was detected in almost all the anterior pituitary cells. Different combinations of P2X receptors were detected in each individual cell type of the rat anterior pituitary. Gonadotrophs express P2X4, P2X5, and P2X6 receptors. Corticotrophs express P2X3 and P2X4 receptors. Folliculo-stellate cells express P2X2 and P2X4 receptors, and somatotrophs, lactotrophs, and thyrotrophs express only P2X4 receptors. The macrophages with Iba-1-ir expressed P2X7 receptors. The possible functions of these P2X receptors in each individual cell type of the rat anterior pituitary are discussed.

YC-1 Antagonizes Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Through the EBP1 p42 Isoform in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.||||||||Novel drugs targeting Wnt signaling are gradually being developed for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. In this study, we used a Wnt-responsive Super-TOPflash (STF) luciferase reporter assay to screen a new compound targeting Wnt signaling. 3-(5'-Hydroxymethyl-2'-furyl)-1-benzylindazole (YC-1) was identified as a small molecule inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Our coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) data showed that YC-1 did not affect the β-catenin/TCF interaction. Then, by mass spectrometry, we identified the ErbB3 receptor-binding protein 1 (EBP1) interaction with the β-catenin/TCF complex upon YC-1 treatment. EBP1 encodes two splice isoforms, p42 and p48. We further demonstrated that YC-1 enhances p42 isoform binding to the β-catenin/TCF complex and reduces the transcriptional activity of the complex. The suppression of colony formation by YC-1 was significantly reversed after knockdown of both isoforms (p48 and p42); however, the inhibition of colony formation was maintained when only EBP1 p48 was silenced. Taken together, these results suggest that YC-1 treatment results in a reduction in Wnt-regulated transcription through EBP1 p42 and leads to the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. These data imply that YC-1 is a drug that antagonizes Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HCC.

Loss of tyrosine kinase receptor Ephb2 impairs proliferation and stem cell activity of spermatogonia in culture†.||||||||Germline stem and progenitor cells can be extracted from the adult mouse testis and maintained long-term in vitro. Yet, the optimal culture conditions for preserving stem cell activity are unknown. Recently, multiple members of the Eph receptor family were detected in murine spermatogonia, but their roles remain obscure. One such gene, Ephb2, is crucial for maintenance of somatic stem cells and was previously found enriched at the level of mRNA in murine spermatogonia. We detected Ephb2 mRNA and protein in primary adult spermatogonial cultures and hypothesized that Ephb2 plays a role in maintenance of stem cells in vitro. We employed CRISPR-Cas9 targeting and generated stable mutant SSC lines with complete loss of Ephb2. The characteristics of Ephb2-KO cells were interrogated using phenotypic and functional assays. Ephb2-KO SSCs exhibited reduced proliferation compared to wild-type cells, while apoptosis was unaffected. Therefore, we examined whether Ephb2 loss correlates with activity of canonical pathways involved in stem cell self-renewal and proliferation. Ephb2-KO cells had reduced ERK MAPK signaling. Using a lentiviral transgene, Ephb2 expression was rescued in Ephb2-KO cells, which partially restored signaling and proliferation. Transplantation analysis revealed that Ephb2-KO SSCs cultures formed significantly fewer colonies than WT, indicating a role for Ephb2 in preserving stem cell activity of cultured cells. Transcriptome analysis of wild type and Ephb2-KO SSCs identified Dppa4 and Bnc1 as differentially expressed, Ephb2-dependent genes that are potentially involved in stem cell function. These data uncover for the first time a crucial role for Ephb2 signaling in cultured SSCs.

Novel discovery of Averrhoa bilimbi ethanolic leaf extract in the stimulation of brown fat differentiation program in combating diet-induced obesity.||||||||Brown adipocytes are known to promote energy expenditure and limit weight gain to combat obesity. Averrhoa bilimbi, locally called belimbing buluh (DBB), is mainly used as an ethnomedicine in the treatment of metabolic disorders including diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity. The present study aims to investigate the browning activity on white adipocytes by A. bilimbi leaf extract and to evaluate the potential mechanisms.||||Ethanolic leaf extract of A. bilimbi was exposed to Myf5 lineage precursor cells to stimulate adipocyte differentiation. Protein expressions of brown adipocyte markers were determined through high content screening analysis and validated through western blotting. Mito Stress Test assay was conducted to evaluate the cellular oxygen consumption rate upon A. bilimbi treatment.||||A. bilimbi ethanolic leaf extract exhibited an adipogenesis effect similar to a PPARgamma agonist. It also demonstrated brown adipocyte differentiation in myoblastic Myf5-positive precursor cells. Expression of UCP1 and PRDM16 were induced. The basal metabolic rate and respiratory capacity of mitochondria were increased upon A. bilimbi treatment.||||The findings suggest that Averrhoa bilimbi ethanolic leaf extract induces adipocyte browning through PRDM16 activation and enhances mitochondria activity due to UCP1 up-regulation.

Up-regulation of HDACs, a harbinger of uraemic endothelial dysfunction, is prevented by defibrotide.||||||||Endothelial dysfunction is an earlier contributor to the development of atherosclerosis in chronic kidney disease (CKD), in which the role of epigenetic triggers cannot be ruled out. Endothelial protective strategies, such as defibrotide (DF), may be useful in this scenario. We evaluated changes induced by CKD on endothelial cell proteome and explored the effect of DF and the mechanisms involved. Human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells were exposed to sera from healthy donors (n = 20) and patients with end-stage renal disease on haemodialysis (n = 20). Differential protein expression was investigated by using a proteomic approach, Western blot and immunofluorescence. HDAC1 and HDAC2 overexpression was detected. Increased HDAC1 expression occurred at both cytoplasm and nucleus. These effects were dose-dependently inhibited by DF. Both the HDACs inhibitor trichostatin A and DF prevented the up-regulation of the endothelial dysfunction markers induced by the uraemic milieu: intercellular adhesion molecule-1, surface Toll-like receptor-4, von Willebrand Factor and reactive oxygen species. Moreover, DF down-regulated HDACs expression through the PI3/AKT signalling pathway. HDACs appear as key modulators of the CKD-induced endothelial dysfunction as specific blockade by trichostatin A or by DF prevents endothelial dysfunction responses to the CKD insult. Moreover, DF exerts its endothelial protective effect by inhibiting HDAC up-regulation likely through PI3K/AKT.

Methamphetamine exacerbates neuroinflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide by activating dopamine D1-like receptors.||||||||Methamphetamine (METH) is a highly addictive and widely abused drug worldwide. Although much research is on the drug's direct effects, METH may also alter host immunity. The mechanism by which METH influences immunity remains elusive. Here, C57BL6/J mice were intraperitoneally injected with 5 mg/kg METH four times at two-hour intervals. The microglial inhibitor minocycline or dopamine D1-like receptor antagonist SCH-23390 was also applied prior to METH injection. Twenty-four hours following the first METH injection, mice were challenged by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a dose of 330 μg/kg, and the hippocampus (Hip), caudate putamen (CPU), nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) were collected 4 h after LPS administration. IL-6 and TNF-α levels were detected by ELISA. The activation of D1-like receptors and microglial marker Iba1 were examined by immunohistochemical staining and Western blot. Finally, we examined the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and CREB. We found that METH exposure increased LPS-induced IL-6 and TNF-α production in the Hip, CPU and NAc regions. METH also augmented microglia activation and D1/5DR expression in response to LPS. Moreover, administering SCH-23390 significantly reduced IL-6 and TNF-α production and Iba1 expression following LPS challenge. Similar inhibitory effects were also observed by minocycline administration. Moreover, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and CREB was increased after METH and LPS exposure but decreased by SCH-23390. These data illustrate that METH exacerbates neuroinflammation response in LPS-stimulated mouse brains through dopamine D1-like receptors, microglia, and relevant signaling proteins, which may have therapeutic implications.

Inhibition of the NF-κB/STAT3/MAPK Pathways.||||||||Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common and serious complications of sepsis in which the inflammatory cascade plays a crucial role. There is now increasing evidence that lipid mediators derived from the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have potent anti-inflammatory effects that promote the timely regression of acute inflammation. In this study, we investigated the protective effects and molecular mechanism of a novel DHA-derived lipid mediator Maresin 1 (MaR1) on AKI in septic mice. The cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used to establish a sepsis mice model. As a result, we found that MaR1 significantly increased the 7-day survival rate of septic mice and the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 while reducing bacterial load and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β). In addition, MaR1 dose dependently reduced renal injury scores and serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels in septic mice while inhibiting renal neutrophil infiltration and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. In terms of signaling pathway, we found that MaR1 inhibits the expression of phosphorylated p65, Stat3, JNK, ERK, and p38 and significantly reduces nuclear translocation of p65. In conclusion, our results indicate that MaR1 is able to reduce neutrophil infiltration and inhibit nuclear factor-kappa B/signal transducer and activator of transcriptor 3/mitogen-activated protein kinase (NF-κB/STAT3/MAPK) activity and regulate inflammatory cytokine level to inhibit inflammatory response and thereby weaken sepsis-associated AKI in mice.

Using a Novel Diagnostic Nomogram to Differentiate Malignant from Benign Parathyroid Neoplasms.||||||||We sought to develop an immunohistochemical (IHC) tool to support the diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma (PC) and help differentiate it from atypical parathyroid neoplasms (atypical) and benign adenomas. Distinguishing PC from benign parathyroid neoplasms can be challenging. Many cases of PC are histopathologically borderline for definitive malignancy. Recently, individual IHC biomarkers have been evaluated to aid in discrimination between parathyroid neoplasms. PC, atypical parathyroid neoplasms, and parathyroid adenomas treated at our institution from 1997 to 2014 were studied retrospectively. IHC analysis was performed to evaluate parafibromin, retinoblastoma (RB), protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5), Ki67, galectin-3, and E-cadherin expression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and multivariable logistic regression model for combinations of biomarkers were evaluated to classify patients as PC or atypical/adenoma. A diagnostic nomogram using 5 biomarkers was created for PC. Sixty-three patients were evaluated. The percent staining of parafibromin (p < 0.0001), RB (p = 0.04), Ki67 (p = 0.02), PGP9.5 (p = 0.04), and Galectin-3 (p = 0.01) differed significantly in the three diagnostic groups. ROC analysis demonstrated that parafibromin had the best performance in discriminating PC from atypical/adenoma; area under the curve (AUC) was 81% (cutoff, 92.5%; sensitivity rate, 64%; specificity rate, 87%). We created a diagnostic nomogram using a combination of biomarkers; AUC was 84.9% (95% confidence interval, 73.4-96.4%). The optimism-adjusted AUC for this model was 80.5% (mean absolute error, 0.043). A diagnostic nomogram utilizing an immunoexpression, a combination of immunohistochemical biomarkers, can be used to help differentiate PC from other parathyroid neoplasms, thus potentially improving diagnostic classification.

Identification of charged amino acids required for nuclear localization of human L1 ORF1 protein.||||||||Long Interspersed Element 1 (LINE-1) is a retrotransposon that is present in 500,000 copies in the human genome. Along with Alu and SVA elements, these three retrotransposons account for more than a third of the human genome sequence. These mobile elements are able to copy themselves within the genome via an RNA intermediate, a process that can promote genome instability. LINE-1 encodes two proteins, ORF1p and ORF2p. Association of ORF1p, ORF2p and a full-length L1 mRNA in a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle, L1 RNP, is required for L1 retrotransposition. Previous studies have suggested that fusion of a tag to L1 proteins can interfere with L1 retrotransposition.||||Using antibodies detecting untagged human ORF1p, western blot analysis and manipulation of ORF1 sequence and length, we have identified a set of charged amino acids in the C-terminal region of ORF1p that are important in determining its subcellular localization. Mutation of 7 non-identical lysine residues is sufficient to make the resulting ORF1p to be predominantly cytoplasmic, demonstrating intrinsic redundancy of this requirement. These residues are also necessary for ORF1p to retain its association with KPNA2 nuclear pore protein. We demonstrate that this interaction is significantly reduced by RNase treatment. Using co-IP, we have also determined that human ORF1p associates with all members of the KPNA subfamily.||||The prediction of NLS sequences suggested that specific sequences within ORF1p could be responsible for its subcellular localization by interacting with nuclear binding proteins. We have found that multiple charged amino acids in the C-terminus of ORF1p are involved in ORF1 subcellular localization and interaction with KPNA2 nuclear pore protein. Our data demonstrate that different amino acids can be mutated to have the same phenotypic effect on ORF1p subcellular localization, demonstrating that the net number of charged residues or protein structure, rather than their specific location, is important for the ORF1p nuclear localization. We also identified that human ORF1p interacts with all members of the KPNA family of proteins and that multiple KPNA family genes are expressed in human cell lines.

Modulators of CXCR4 and CXCR7/ACKR3 Function.||||||||The two G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3) are part of the class A chemokine GPCR family and represent important drug targets for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, cancer, and inflammation diseases. CXCR4 is one of only three chemokine receptors with a US Food and Drug Administration approved therapeutic agent, the small-molecule modulator AMD3100. In this review, known modulators of the two receptors are discussed in detail. Initially, the structural relationship between receptors and ligands is reviewed on the basis of common structural motifs and available crystal structures. To date, no atypical chemokine receptor has been crystallized, which makes ligand design and predictions for these receptors more difficult. Next, the selectivity, receptor activation, and the resulting ligand-induced signaling output of chemokines and other peptide ligands are reviewed. Binding of pepducins, a class of lipid-peptides whose basis is the internal loop of a GPCR, to CXCR4 is also discussed. Finally, small-molecule modulators of CXCR4 and ACKR3 are reviewed. These modulators have led to the development of radio- and fluorescently labeled tool compounds, enabling the visualization of ligand binding and receptor characterization both in vitro and in vivo. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: To investigate the pharmacological modulation of CXCR4 and ACKR3, significant effort has been focused on the discovery and development of a range of ligands, including small-molecule modulators, pepducins, and synthetic peptides. Imaging tools, such as fluorescent probes, also play a pivotal role in the field of drug discovery.

Jieduan-Niwan Formula Reduces Liver Apoptosis in a Rat Model of Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure by Regulating the E2F1-Mediated Intrinsic Apoptosis Pathway.|||||||| and IL-6 proteins were reduced in the JDNW group at the corresponding time points, the survival rates of rats were increased, and the pathological condition of the liver was improved. In addition, JDNW treatment improved the ultrastructure of hepatocytes and mitochondria and decreased the hepatocyte apoptosis index. E2F1, P53, P73, Apaf-1, p14ARF, caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7 levels in the JDNW group were distinctly lower than those in the untreated rats. Moreover, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 levels increased. Thus, JDNW decreases ACLF-induced mortality in rats by modulating the E2F1-mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

Evaluation of risk factors for colistin resistance among uropathogenic isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae: a case-control study.||||||||The last few years have seen the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative infections, which are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The indiscriminate use of colistin has led to the development of resistance, which can be diagnosed effectively by broth microdilution. Studies from India are limited, and this study was conducted in order to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with colistin resistance.|||| (resistant) were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the mcr1, mcr2 and mgrB genes. A case-control study with 21 cases (resistant) and 42 matched controls (sensitive) was designed to evaluate risk factors and outcomes (recurrent UTI, readmission and hospital stay >2 weeks).||||Two hundred and fifty MDR isolates (E. coli=142/2319 and K.pneumoniae=108/775) from 216 patients were selected from the 25 046 isolates screened. Twenty-five isolates (20 K.pneumoniae and 5 E. coli) were resistant to colistin, with a prevalence of 3.52  % in E. coli and 18.5  % in K. pneumoniae among the MDR isolates. PCR for the mcr1 and mcr2 genes was negative. Multivariate regression showed that multiple episodes of hospitalization, hospital stay >2 weeks, exposure to >three antibiotic classes and abnormality/surgery of the lower urinary tract were the significant risk factors for colistin resistance. Previous use of colistin and colistin resistance had a significant effect on all outcomes.||||K. pneumoniae show six times higher prevalence of colistin resistance than E. coli, and the emergence of resistant organisms has led to an increase in morbidity in infected patients.

PLK1 contributes to autophagy by regulating MYC stabilization in osteosarcoma cells.||||||||PLK1, a typical PLK protein, is the main driver of cancer cell growth and proliferation. It is an inhibitor of the protein kinases that is currently being investigated in clinical studies. It is often used as a tumor marker, as high PLK1 expression correlates with poor prognosis in cancer. Overexpression of MYC is a hallmark of many human cancers. MYC modulates the transcription of thousands of genes that required to coordinate a series of cellular processes, including those essential for growth, proliferation, differentiation, self-renewal and apoptosis. To date, functions of PLK1 and MYC on tumor are mostly studied in separate researches, and studies on their mutual crosstalk are lacking.||||To investigate the mechanism of PLK1 and MYC in regulating progress of osteosarcoma.||||Protein level was examined using Western blot. Animal experiments were performed with female FOX CHASE severe combined immunodeﬁcient mice. Mice were randomly divided into experimental or control groups.||||PLK1 or MYC promoted the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells through the autophagy pathway. PLK1 contributed to MYC protein stabilization. PLK1 inhibition enhanced MYC degradation in osteosarcoma cells. PLK1 inhibition led to a marked decline in MYC protein abundance. The representative MYC target genes were deregulated by PLK1 inhibitors. BI2536 treatment caused a significant delay in xenograft tumor growth in mice injected with U-2 OS cells subcutaneously, with lower mean tumor weight compared to the control group.||||PLK1 is crucial for MYC stabilization. It promotes cell proliferation by autophagy pathway in osteosarcoma cells. Data validate PLK1 as a potential therapeutic target in osteosarcoma caused by MYC-amplified.

Distant metastasis due to heavily pigmented epithelioid melanoma with underlying BRAF V600E, NOTCH1, ERBB3, and PTEN mutations.||||||||Pigment-synthesizing melanoma (PSM) describes a morphologically and genetically diverse group of melanomas. In contrast, pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma (PEM) encompasses a spectrum of indolent tumors now classified as borderline/intermediate melanocytic tumors. Herein, we report a case of widely metastatic heavily pigmented epithelioid melanoma with fatal outcome in a 36-year-old woman. Next-generation sequencing identified somatic (tumoral) mutations in BRAF V600E, PTEN, NOTCH1, and ERBB3. By contrast, GNAQ and GNA11 were wild type. Prkar1α and p16 expression were maintained. Identification of mutations in NOTCH1 and ERBB3 may support the diagnosis of heavily pigmented epithelioid melanoma. In contrast, PRKCA fusion genes and PRKAR1A mutations support the diagnosis of PEM. Given the heterogeneity, potential overlap (loss of Prkar1α expression), and evolving genetic profiles of these two distinct groups of tumors, careful appraisal of molecular profiles in the light of histomorphology and clinical history is necessary for distinction between PEM and PSMs including heavily pigmented epithelioid melanomas, with significant potential impact on prognosis and therapy.

Embryonic expression of GINS members in the development of the mammalian nervous system.||||||||The GINS (Go, Ichi, Nii, and San) complex contains four protein subunits (PSF1, PSF2, PSF3, and SLD5) and has been identified as a factor essential for the initiation and elongation stages of the DNA replication process. A previous study indicated that PSF2 participated in the developing central nervous system (CNS) of Xenopus laevis. However, the expression and function of GINS members in the mammalian developing nervous system remains unclear. Here, we examined the expression of GINS members in mice during nervous system development via immunofluorescence staining. At the beginning of neural development, PSF1 and SLD5 were highly expressed in neuroepithelial stem cells (NSCs) of the inner surface of neural tube (NT) and overlapped with proliferation marker Ki67. After entering the mid- and late-phase of neural development, PSF1 and SLD5 changed their regions of expression. These genes were highly expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) progenitors, but they showed no overlap with Ki67 positive cells. Instead, a reduction of SLD5 expression promoted neuronal differentiation and maturation in the late-phase. PSF2 and PSF3 showed no tissue-specificity. PSF2 was constitutively and highly expressed whereas PSF3 was expressed at very low levels during neural development. In this study, we demonstrated variations in proteins and expression regions of the GINS members during mammalian CNS development and revealed a correlation between GINS expression and cell proliferation. Furthermore, we have suggested a novel function of GINS member SLD5, which regulates the differentiation of neural stem/progenitors.

Primary thyroid lymphoma: A series from a tertiary care center in Northern India.||||||||Primary thyroid lymphoma (PTL) is a rare entity, necessitating accurate and early diagnosis, as its management is very different from that of other neoplasms intrinsic to the thyroid.||||Cases diagnosed between January 2009 and March 2015 were retrieved, and clinical details were noted. Hematoxylin- and eosin-stained slides were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for immunophenotyping, and cases were classified according to the World Health Organization 2017 classification of hematolymphoid neoplasms.||||Eleven patients with PTL were identified, with a mean age of 64.6 years (range: 40-76 years), including three males and eight females. Duration of symptoms ranged from 2 to 36 months (mean: 9.3 months). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was most frequent, followed by extranodal marginal zone lymphoma. Most DLBCLs were nongerminal center type. BCL2 was positive in all DLBCLs. Strong p53 immunopositivity was not seen in any of the cases analyzed.||||Histopathological evaluation supplemented by IHC is the gold standard for the diagnosis of PTL. Combined chemoradiotherapy appears to be the best treatment modality, irrespective of histological type. MIB-1 and MUM1 IHC may have a role in identifying DLBCL, particularly in small biopsies.

Role of soluble endoglin in BMP9 signaling.||||||||Endoglin (ENG) is a coreceptor of the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) family signaling complex, which is highly expressed on endothelial cells and plays a key role in angiogenesis. Its extracellular domain can be cleaved and released into the circulation as soluble ENG (sENG). High circulating levels of sENG contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia (PE). Circulating bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9), a vascular quiescence and endothelial-protective factor, binds sENG with high affinity, but how sENG participates in BMP9 signaling complexes is not fully resolved. sENG was thought to be a ligand trap for BMP9, preventing type II receptor binding and BMP9 signaling. Here we show that, despite cell-surface ENG being a dimer linked by disulfide bonds, sENG purified from human placenta and plasma from PE patients is primarily in a monomeric form. Incubating monomeric sENG with the circulating form of BMP9 (prodomain-bound form) in solution leads to the release of the prodomain and formation of a sENG:BMP9 complex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that binding of sENG to BMP9 does not inhibit BMP9 signaling. Indeed, the sENG:BMP9 complex signals with comparable potency and specificity to BMP9 on human primary endothelial cells. The full signaling activity of the sENG:BMP9 complex required transmembrane ENG. This study confirms that rather than being an inhibitory ligand trap, increased circulating sENG might preferentially direct BMP9 signaling via cell-surface ENG at the endothelium. This is important for understanding the role of sENG in the pathobiology of PE and other cardiovascular diseases.

A Novel Sulforaphane-Regulated Gene Network in Suppression of Breast Cancer-Induced Osteolytic Bone Resorption.||||||||Bone is the most preferred site for colonization of metastatic breast cancer cells for each subtype of the disease. The standard of therapeutic care for breast cancer patients with bone metastasis include bisphosphonates (e.g., zoledronic acid), which have poor oral bioavailability, and a humanized antibody (denosumab). However, these therapies are palliative and a subset of patients still develop new bone lesions and/or experience serious adverse effects. Therefore, a safe and orally bioavailable intervention for therapy of osteolytic bone resorption is still a clinically unmet need. This study demonstrates suppression of breast cancer-induced bone resorption by a small molecule (sulforaphane, SFN) that is safe clinically and orally bioavailable. In vitro osteoclast differentiation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner upon addition of conditioned media from SFN-treated breast cancer cells representative of different subtypes. Targeted microarrays coupled with interrogation of TCGA dataset revealed a novel SFN-regulated gene signature involving cross-regulation of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and nuclear factor-κB and their downstream effectors. Both RUNX2 and p65/p50 expression were higher in human breast cancer tissues compared to normal mammary tissues. RUNX2 was recruited at the promotor of NFKB1. Inhibition of osteoclast differentiation by SFN was augmented by doxycycline-inducible stable knockdown of RUNX2. Oral SFN administration significantly increased the percentage of bone volume/total volume of affected bones in the intracardiac MDA-MB-231-Luc model indicating in vivo suppression of osteolytic bone resorption by SFN. These results indicate that SFN is a novel inhibitor of breast cancer induced osteolytic bone resorption in vitro and in vivo.

STAT3 and STAT5 Activation in Solid Cancers.||||||||The Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT)3 and 5 proteins are activated by many cytokine receptors to regulate specific gene expression and mitochondrial functions. Their role in cancer is largely context-dependent as they can both act as oncogenes and tumor suppressors. We review here the role of STAT3/5 activation in solid cancers and summarize their association with survival in cancer patients. The molecular mechanisms that underpin the oncogenic activity of STAT3/5 signaling include the regulation of genes that control cell cycle and cell death. However, recent advances also highlight the critical role of STAT3/5 target genes mediating inflammation and stemness. In addition, STAT3 mitochondrial functions are required for transformation. On the other hand, several tumor suppressor pathways act on or are activated by STAT3/5 signaling, including tyrosine phosphatases, the sumo ligase Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT3 (PIAS3), the E3 ubiquitin ligase TATA Element Modulatory Factor/Androgen Receptor-Coactivator of 160 kDa (TMF/ARA160), the miRNAs miR-124 and miR-1181, the Protein of alternative reading frame 19 (p19ARF)/p53 pathway and the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 and 3 (SOCS1/3) proteins. Cancer mutations and epigenetic alterations may alter the balance between pro-oncogenic and tumor suppressor activities associated with STAT3/5 signaling, explaining their context-dependent association with tumor progression both in human cancers and animal models.

Mismatch Repair Deficiency in Endometrial Cancer: Immunohistochemistry Staining and Clinical Implications.||||||||DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency is associated with increased risk of developing several types of cancer and is the most common cause of hereditary endometrial cancer. Identification of the microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype in endometrial carcinoma is important given that such tumors are frequent.||||The objective of this study was to assess the utility of immunohistochemistry (IHC), a simple and fast technique, in detecting MSI status in endometrial carcinoma and evaluate the correlation between the MSI phenotype and the various anatomo-clinical parameters.||||IHC expression of 4 markers (MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, and MSH6) was studied. For all IHC markers, a combined score based on the intensity of nuclear labeling and the percentage of labeled cells was defined to establish a score. Correlation between MSI phenotype and different clinicopathologic parameters was evaluated using statistical analysis (software STATA and the Fisher exact test).||||The mean age of the patients was 58.6 years. Positive staining was highly extended (score 3) with 79% to 100% of marked cells. Less than 10% of positive tumor cells were seen in 3% of cases for MSH6 and PMS2. Abnormal MMR IHC was detected in 10 cases (22.22%). Seven tumors showed loss of MLH1/PMS2. The loss of MSH2/MSH6 was observed in 1 case. The loss of MLH1 or PMS2 was seen only in 2 cases. The number of MSI positive status was 10 cases (22.7%). Correlation between clinicopathologic parameters showed MMR deficiency was significantly associated with low-grade tumor and localized stage. There was no positive correlation between age, histologic subtype, or myometrium invasion.||||In summary, detection of DNA MMR deficiencies by IHC can effectively diagnose the MSI phenotype in endometrial carcinoma. Correlation between clinicopathologic parameters showed MMR deficiency was significantly associated with low-grade tumor and localized stage.

Trimming PolyQ proteins with engineered PML.||||||||Protein abnormalities are the major cause of neurodegenerative diseases such as spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). Protein misfolding and impaired degradation leads to the build-up of protein aggregates inside the cell, which may further cause cellular degeneration. Reducing levels of either the soluble misfolded form of the protein or its precipitated aggregate, even marginally, could significantly improve cellular health. Despite numerous pre-existing strategies to target these protein aggregates, there is considerable room to improve their specificity and efficiency. In this study, we demonstrated the enhanced intracellular degradation of both monomers and aggregates of mutant ataxin1 (Atxn1 82Q) by engineering an E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme, promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). Specifically, we showed enhanced degradation of both soluble and aggregated Atxn1 82Q in mammalian cells by targeting this protein using PML fused to single chain variable fragments (scFvs) specific for monomers and aggregates of the target protein. The ability to solubilize Atxn1 82Q aggregates was due to the PML-mediated enhanced SUMOylation of the target protein. This ability to reduce the intracellular levels of both misfolded forms of Atxn1 82Q may not only be useful for treating SCA, but also applicable for the treatment of other PolyQ disorders.

Synovial Fluid MicroRNA-210 as a Potential Biomarker for Early Prediction of Osteoarthritis.||||||||Early detection and treatment are critical in the management of osteoarthritis (OA). OA is closely associated with angiogenesis and the inhibition of angiogenesis presents a novel therapeutic approach to reduce inflammation and pain in OA. Recent reports suggest that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have great potential as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis in OA. In this study, we aimed to explore the clinical significance of miR-210 in synovial fluid samples from 10 healthy volunteers and 20 early-stage OA and 20 late-stage OA patients. miR-210 expression was assessed by real-time RT-PCR. VEGF protein levels were examined by ELISA. The results show that miR-210 is significantly upregulated in early-stage OA and late-stage OA patients compared with healthy individuals. Higher levels of VEGF are also found in OA compared with the control. Moreover, miR-210 levels are positively correlated with VEGF levels, suggesting that miR-210 might contribute to OA development through promoting VEGF expression and angiogenesis. In conclusion, upregulation of miR-210 in synovial fluid may occur in the early stage of OA and can be a useful biomarker for early diagnosis of OA.

Transcriptome analysis of LRRK2 knock-out microglia cells reveals alterations of inflammatory- and oxidative stress-related pathways upon treatment with α-synuclein fibrils.||||||||Several previous studies have linked the Parkinson's disease (PD) gene LRRK2 to the biology of microglia cells. However, the precise ways in which LRRK2 affects microglial function have not been fully resolved. Here, we used the RNA-Sequencing to obtain transcriptomic profiles of LRRK2 wild-type (WT) and knock-out (KO) microglia cells treated with α-synuclein pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a general inflammatory insult. We observed that, although α-synuclein PFFs and LPS mediate overlapping gene expression profiles in microglia, there are also distinct responses to each stimulus. α-Synuclein PFFs trigger alterations of oxidative stress-related pathways with the mitochondrial dismutase Sod2 as a strongly differentially regulated gene. We validated SOD2 at mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, we found that LRRK2 KO microglia cells reported attenuated induction of mitochondrial SOD2 in response to α-synuclein PFFs, indicating a potential contribution of LRRK2 to oxidative stress-related pathways. We validate several genes in vivo using single-cell RNA-Seq from acutely isolated microglia after striatal injection of LPS into the mouse brain. Overall, these results suggest that microglial LRRK2 may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD via altered oxidative stress signaling.

The role of CRP and Pentraxin 3 in the prediction of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and death in acute pancreatitis.||||||||Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is an acute phase protein. Our goal was to assess PTX3 as a predictor of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), death and disease severity in acute pancreatitis (AP) in comparison to C-reactive protein (CRP) and the APACHE II score. From April 2011 to January 2015, 142 patients with AP were included in this single center post hoc analysis of prospectively collected data at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. Disease severity was rated by the revised Atlanta criteria (rAC). Inflammatory response was measured by the SIRS criteria. PTX3, CRP and APACHE II score were measured. Patients median PTX3 plasma concentrations in AP were higher in moderate (3.311 ng/ml) and severe (3.091 ng/ml) than in mild disease (2.461 ng/ml). Overall, 59 occurrences of SIRS or death were observed. In the prediction of SIRS or death, PTX3 was inferior to CRP and APACHE II, with modest predictive discriminatory ability of all three markers and AUC of 0.54, 0.69 and 0.69, respectively. Upon combination of CRP with PTX3, AUC was 0.7. PTX3 seems to be inferior to CRP and APACHE II in the prediction of SIRS or death in AP and does not seem to improve the predictive value of CRP upon combination of both parameters.

In order to fulfill the demand from preclinical and clinical studies, we developed an automated one-pot two-step synthesis of this potent tau imaging agent and studied its stability, and dosimetry in mice and monkeys. We also conducted a preliminary study of this imaging agent in humans. Using this one-pot two-step method, the radiochemical yield (RCY) of [18F]T807 was 20.5 ± 6.1% (n = 15) at the end of bombardment (EOB) in a synthesis time of 70±5 min. The chemical and radiochemical purities were >90% and the specific activities were 151 ± 52 GBq/μmol. The quality of [18F]T807 synthesized by this method met the U.S. Pharmacopoeia (USP) criteria. The stability test showed that the [18F]T807 injection was stable at room temperature for up to 4 h after the end of synthesis (EOS). The estimated effective dose of the [18F]T807 injection extrapolated from monkeys was 19 μSv/MBq (n = 2), while the estimated effective doses of the [18F]T807 injection extrapolated from fasted and non-fasted mice were 123 ± 27 (n = 3) and 94 ± 19 (n = 4) μSv/MBq, respectively. This one-pot two-step automated method produced the [18F]T807 injection with high reproducibility and high quality. PET imaging and radiation dosimetry evaluation in mice and Formosan rock monkeys suggested that the [18F]T807 injection synthesized by this method is suitable for use in human PET imaging studies. Thus, this method could fulfill the demand for the [18F]T807 injection in both preclinical and clinical studies of tauopathies, especially for nearby study sites without cyclotrons.

The effect of statins and the synthetic LXR agonist T0901317 on expression of ABCA1 transporter protein in human lung epithelial cell lines in vitro.||||||||The pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with dyslipidemia, an established co-morbidity. Statins treat hypercholesterolemia, but more recently have been trailed in the setting of COPD for their potential anti-inflammatory benefits. The outcomes of prospective trials however have been inconsistent. Thus, we hypothesize that the variation in results may have been due to statin-induced downregulation of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), thereby reducing cholesterol export. This study aims to elucidate whether statin treatment in a cellular model of COPD leads to a decrease in ABCA1 protein expression.||||To mimic the inflammatory environment of COPD, two commonly used lung epithelial cell lines (BEAS-2B and A549) were treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and co-treated with cholesterol/25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH) to mimic dyslipidemia. ABCA1 protein was detected by Western Blotting.||||We unexpectedly showed that statins did not affect ABCA1 expression. However, the LXR agonist T0901317 significantly increased ABCA1 expression in both cell lines, while TNF, cholesterol or 25-OH induced ABCA1 protein upregulation in BEAS-2B cells, indicating cell line differences in response. There was also evidence of synergistic impacts of combined treatments on ABCA1 upregulation in BEAS-2B cells.||||Statins did not have an impact on ABCA1 expression in lung epithelial cell lines, disproving our original hypothesis. However, we showed for the first time, the effect of the inflammatory cytokine TNF, cholesterol/25-OH, statins and the LXR agonist T0901317 on expression of ABCA1 transporter protein in human lung epithelial cell lines in vitro. We hope that these in vitro studies may prove beneficial for addressing dyslipidemia in COPD in the future.

Epidemiological investigations have revealed that genogroup II, genotype 6 noroviruses (GII.6) are common agents of gastroenteritis. Upon sequencing of the ORF2 (encoding the viral capsid), GII.6 viruses have been distinguished into three variants. Sentinel hospital-based surveillance in Italy revealed that GII.6 noroviruses were the second most common capsid genotype in 2015, mostly in association with a GII.P7 ORF1 (encoding the viral polymerase). Upon molecular characterization of the ORF1 and ORF2, the GII.P7_GII.6 epidemic viruses circulating in 2014-2015 (variant GII.6b) were different from those that circulated sporadically in 2011-2013 (variant GII.6a). Analysis of the ORF1 (GII.P7) and ORF2 (GII.6) sequences available in the databases unveiled marked genetic diversity and peculiarities in the phylogenetic segregation patterns, suggesting multiple recombination events. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that recent GII.P7_GII.6b viruses were circulating as early as 2008, and formed a genetically homogenous group that emerged globally.

The results showed that the expression level of the P2X4 receptor protein was highest, followed by P2X5, P2X3, P2X2, P2X6, and P2X7 receptor proteins, but no P2X1 receptor protein was detected. Strong P2X4 receptor-immunoreactivity was detected in almost all the anterior pituitary cells.

Here, we report that two dioxygenase-encoding genes, SLC1 (slender and crinklyleaf 1) and SLC2 (slender and crinklyleaf 2), play essential roles in shoot development and SA production in rice (Oryza sativa). Overexpression of SLC1 (SLC1-OE) or SLC2 (SLC2-OE) in rice produced bizarre infertile plants with slender and crinkly leaves. Disruption of SLC1 or SLC2 led to dwarf plants. Down-regulation of SLC1 and SLC2 at the same time in the SLC1-SLC2 RNAi lines resulted in a severe defect in early leaf development. Enhanced SA level in the SLC1-OE plants and decreased SA level in the slc1 and slc2 mutants were scored. Accordingly, altered expression level of a set of SA-related genes in plants of SLC1-OE, slc1 and slc2 mutants was observed. The results from exploring the putative interacting proteins for SLC1 indicated that, either the KNOX1- or ELK-domain of OSH1 (homeobox1) is sufficient for accomplishing the interaction between SLC1 and OSH1. Collectively, our data revealed the importance of SLC1 and SLC2 in the shoot development of rice.

YC-1 Antagonizes Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Through the EBP1 p42 Isoform in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.||||||||Novel drugs targeting Wnt signaling are gradually being developed for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. In this study, we used a Wnt-responsive Super-TOPflash (STF) luciferase reporter assay to screen a new compound targeting Wnt signaling. 3-(5'-Hydroxymethyl-2'-furyl)-1-benzylindazole (YC-1) was identified as a small molecule inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Our coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) data showed that YC-1 did not affect the β-catenin/TCF interaction. Then, by mass spectrometry, we identified the ErbB3 receptor-binding protein 1 (EBP1) interaction with the β-catenin/TCF complex upon YC-1 treatment. EBP1 encodes two splice isoforms, p42 and p48. We further demonstrated that YC-1 enhances p42 isoform binding to the β-catenin/TCF complex and reduces the transcriptional activity of the complex. The suppression of colony formation by YC-1 was significantly reversed after knockdown of both isoforms (p48 and p42); however, the inhibition of colony formation was maintained when only EBP1 p48 was silenced. Taken together, these results suggest that YC-1 treatment results in a reduction in Wnt-regulated transcription through EBP1 p42 and leads to the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. These data imply that YC-1 is a drug that antagonizes Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HCC.

Loss of tyrosine kinase receptor Ephb2 impairs proliferation and stem cell activity of spermatogonia in culture†.||||||||Germline stem and progenitor cells can be extracted from the adult mouse testis and maintained long-term in vitro. Yet, the optimal culture conditions for preserving stem cell activity are unknown. Recently, multiple members of the Eph receptor family were detected in murine spermatogonia, but their roles remain obscure. One such gene, Ephb2, is crucial for maintenance of somatic stem cells and was previously found enriched at the level of mRNA in murine spermatogonia. We detected Ephb2 mRNA and protein in primary adult spermatogonial cultures and hypothesized that Ephb2 plays a role in maintenance of stem cells in vitro. We employed CRISPR-Cas9 targeting and generated stable mutant SSC lines with complete loss of Ephb2. The characteristics of Ephb2-KO cells were interrogated using phenotypic and functional assays. Ephb2-KO SSCs exhibited reduced proliferation compared to wild-type cells, while apoptosis was unaffected. Therefore, we examined whether Ephb2 loss correlates with activity of canonical pathways involved in stem cell self-renewal and proliferation. Ephb2-KO cells had reduced ERK MAPK signaling. Using a lentiviral transgene, Ephb2 expression was rescued in Ephb2-KO cells, which partially restored signaling and proliferation. Transplantation analysis revealed that Ephb2-KO SSCs cultures formed significantly fewer colonies than WT, indicating a role for Ephb2 in preserving stem cell activity of cultured cells. Transcriptome analysis of wild type and Ephb2-KO SSCs identified Dppa4 and Bnc1 as differentially expressed, Ephb2-dependent genes that are potentially involved in stem cell function. These data uncover for the first time a crucial role for Ephb2 signaling in cultured SSCs.

Ets-1 enhances tumor migration through regulation of CCR7 expression.||||||||Ets-1 is a prototype of the ETS protein family. Members of the ETS protein family contain a unique ETS domain. Ets-1 is associated with cancer progression and metastasis in many types of cancer. Many studies have shown a link between elevated expression of Ets-1 in cancer biopsies and poor survival. CCR7 is a chemokine that binds to specific ligand CCL21/CCL19. CCR7 expression is associated with tumor metastasis and infiltration into lymph nodes. The objective of this study was to test whether Ets-1 could regulate CCR7 expression and enhance tumor metastasis. Our data showed that CCR7 expression was downregulated in Ets-1-deficient T cells upon T-cell stimulation. Overexpression of Ets-1 increased CCR7 expression in breast cancer cell lines. In contrast, knockdown of Ets-1 reduced CCR7 expression. Ets-1 could directly bind to CCR7 promoter and mediate CCR7 expression in luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Transactivation activity of Ets-1 was independent of the Pointed domain of Ets-1. Ets-1 could also enhance NF-κB and CBP transactivation of CCR7 promoter. Our results also showed that Ets-1 could modulate cancer cell transmigration by altering CCR7 expression in transwell assay and wound healing assay. Taken together, our data suggest that Ets-1 can enhance CCR7 expression and contribute to tumor cell migration. [BMB Reports 2019; 52(9): 548-553].

Microarray analysis represents a powerful approach to identify novel genetic factors regulating the γ-globin gene. Gene expression profiling was previously performed on 14 individuals with high or normal HbF levels to identify the genetic factors that control γ-globin gene expression. To obtain more accurate and reliable results, our results were combined with public microarray dataset GSE22109 deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Annotation of case versus control samples was taken directly from the microarray documentation. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained and were deeply analyzed by bioinformatics methods. Combined with our own chip expression data, potential genes HBE1, TFRC, and CSF2 were selected out for subsequent qRT-PCR validation. A total of 184 DEGs were identified from GSE22109 and the protein-protein interaction network was constructed. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that the hematopoietic cell lineage pathway overlaps in the two datasets. HBE1, CSF2, and TFRC were confirmed by qRT-PCR. Our results suggest novel candidate genes and pathways associated with the γ-globin gene expression.

A clinical, pathological and immunohistochemical series of 9 cases of primary cutaneous apocrine carcinomas of the head and neck.||||||||Primary cutaneous apocrine carcinoma is a rare malignant adnexal skin tumour that can recur locally, spread to regional lymph nodes and metastatize to visceral organs. Wide dissemination and death from disease are much less common. The axilla is the most common site of presentation. It is infrequently reported in the head and neck region.||||All cases diagnosed as primary cutaneous apocrine carcinoma of the head and neck were retrospectively collected from the archives of the Division of Pathological Anatomy, University of Florence from 1996 to 2016. There was no history or clinical evidence of breast cancer. Clinical data and follow-up were collected by the clinicians.||||Nine cases were found, with a mean age of 76 years, ranging in size between 0.3 and 3.5 cm. Clinically, they were frequently mistaken for basal cell carcinomas. Histopathologically, all the tumours showed decapitation secretion, a tubular, solid or mixed (tubulo-papillary and solid-tubular) growth pattern and were predominantly classified as grade 2 tumours. GCDFP-15 and hormone receptors were variably expressed. HER2 and podoplanin were negative in all cases. In one case, spreading to regional lymph nodes was observed. No cases were associated with death due to the disease.||||As immunohistochemical analysis lacks specificity in distinguishing primary cutaneous apocrine carcinoma from a cutaneous metastasis of breast carcinoma, detailed clinical history, breast examination, adequate treatment and follow-up are necessary to confirm a diagnosis of primary cutaneous apocrine carcinoma.

CDK5-dependent phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TRIM59 promotes macroH2A1 ubiquitination and tumorigenicity.||||||||Despite the development of adjuvant therapies, glioblastoma (GBM) patients remain incurable, thus justifying the urgent need of new therapies. CDK5 plays a critical role in GBM and is a potential target for GBM. However, the mechanism by which CDK5 promotes GBM tumorigenicity remains largely unknown. Here, we identify TRIM59 as a substrate of CDK5. EGFR-activated CDK5 directly binds to and phosphorylates TRIM59, a ubiquitin ligase at serine 308, which recruits PIN1 for cis-trans isomerization of TRIM59, leading to TRIM59 binding to importin α5 and nuclear translocation. Nuclear TRIM59 induces ubiquitination and degradation of the tumor suppressive histone variant macroH2A1, leading to enhanced STAT3 signaling activation and tumorigenicity. These findings are confirmed by inhibition of CDK5-activated TRIM59 activity that results in suppression of intracranial tumor growth. Correlative expressions of the components of this pathway are clinically prognostic. Our findings suggest targeting CDK5/TRIM59 signaling axis as a putative strategy for treating GBM.

Deferoxamine therapy reduces brain hemin accumulation after intracerebral hemorrhage in piglets.||||||||Hemopexin (Hpx) is critical for hemin scavenging after the erythrocyte lysis that occurs following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1, also called CD91) is an important receptor through which the hemin-Hpx complex can undergo endocytosis. This study investigated changes in the hemin-Hpx-CD91 axis in both hematoma and perihematomal tissue in a large animal ICH model. The effect of deferoxamine (DFX) on hemin-Hpx-CD91 was also examined. The study consisted of two parts. First, piglets had an injection of autologous blood into the right frontal lobe of brain and were euthanized from day 1 to day 7. Hematoma and perihematomal tissue of brains were used for hemin assay, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. Second, piglets with ICH were treated with deferoxamine or vehicle, and were euthanized for hemin measurement and Hpx and CD91 immunohistochemistry. We found that there was an increase of hemin levels within the hematoma and perihematomal brain tissue after ICH. Hpx and CD91-positive cells were present in the clot and perihematomal tissue from day 1. Hpx and CD91 positive cells were Iba1 positive. After DFX therapy, hemin dropped markedly in the hematoma and perihematomal brain tissue. Furthermore, DFX treatment decreased the number of Hpx and CD91 positive cells in and around the hematoma. In conclusion, hemin accumulation occurs in and around the hematoma. Increases in Hpx and CD91 may be important in scavenging that hemin. DFX treatment decreased hemin release from the hematoma and reduced the expression of Hpx and CD91.

LABAs and p38MAPK Inhibitors Reverse the Corticosteroid-Insensitivity of IL-8 in Airway Smooth Muscle Cells of COPD.||||||||Airway inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is partially insensitive/resistant to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). ICS plus bronchodilator therapy has been discussed for COPD phenotypes with frequent exacerbations and participation of corticosteroid-sensitive type 2/eosinophilic inflammation. Neutralization of non-type 2/IL-8-associated airway inflammation by reversion of its corticosteroid-resistance might be a future strategy for other phenotypes. Human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) produce corticosteroid-insensitive IL-8 in response to TNFα or LPS in stable disease stages or bacteria-induced exacerbations, respectively. p38-mitogen-activated-protein-kinases (p38MAPKs) are alternative therapeutic targets. Hypothesis: long-acting-β2-agonists (LABAs) reverse the corticosteroid-insensitivity of IL-8 by p38MAPK inhibition in HASMCs. Cultivated HASMCs from COPD subjects were pre-incubated with formoterol, salmeterol, fluticasone-propionate, BIRB796 (p38MAPKα, -γ, -δ inhibitor), and/or SB203580 (p38MAPKα and -β inhibitor) before stimulation with TNFα or LPS. IL-8 and MAPK-activities were measured by ELISA. Formoterol, salmeterol, and fluticasone did not or hardly reduced TNFα- or LPS-induced IL-8. BIRB796 and SB203580 reduced TNFα-induced IL-8. SB203580 reduced LPS-induced IL-8. Fluticasone/formoterol, fluticasone/salmeterol, and fluticasone/BIRB796, but not fluticasone/SB203580 combinations, reduced TNFα-induced IL-8 stronger than single treatments. All combinations including fluticasone/SB203580 reduced LPS-induced IL-8 stronger than single treatments. TNFα induced p38MAPKα and -γ activity. LPS induced p38MAPKα activity. Formoterol reduced TNFα-induced p38MAPKγ and LPS-induced p38MAPKα activity. LABAs reverse the corticosteroid-insensitivity of IL-8 in airway smooth muscles via p38MAPKγ in stable disease and via p38MAPKα in exacerbations. Our pre-clinical data indicate a utility for also adding ICS in non-type 2 inflammatory COPD phenotypes to bronchodilator therapy. Depending on phenotype and disease stage, isoform-specific p38MAPK blockers might also reverse corticosteroid-resistance in COPD.

CAMTA-1 Expression in 24 Cases of Hepatic Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma in a Single Institute: Diagnostic Utility for Differential Diagnosis from Hepatic Angiosarcoma.||||||||Epithelioid hemangio-endothelioma (EHE) of the liver is an uncommon vascular tumor with variable clinical courses ranging from stable disease to fatal outcome. EHE can mimic epithelioid angiosarcoma, which has a more aggressive behavior, especially in a small biopsy sample. EHEs are known to have the WWTR1-CAMTA1 fusion gene, and nuclear expression of CAMTA1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been reported in about 90% of EHEs in multiple organs. Our study aimed to validate the diagnostic utility of CAMTA1 expression in EHEs, especially in the liver.||||IHC was performed using anti-CAMTA1 antibody in 34 tumors (24 hepatic EHEs and 10 angiosarcomas). In CAMTA1-negative EHEs, TFE3 IHC was performed.||||Of the 24 hepatic EHEs, 22 (91.6%) showed nuclear staining for CAMTA1. One of two CAMTA1-negative cases showed TFE3 positivity. The other case was negative for TFE3. Meanwhile, all 10 angiosarcoma cases had no CAMTA1 expression.||||CAMTA1 is a highly sensitive and specific marker for diagnosis of hepatic EHE. It is helpful for differentiation of hepatic EHE and angiosarcoma, especially in small biopsy samples.

ATPR-induced differentiation and G0/G1 phase arrest in acute promyelocytic leukemia by repressing EBP50/NCF1 complex to promote the production of ROS.||||||||Our previous study has demonstrated that 4-amino-2-trifluoromethyl-phenyl Retinate (ATPR) can induce human leukemia NB4 cells differentiation and G0/G1 phase arrest, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we used proteomics to screen differentially expressed protein profiles in NB4 cells before and after ATPR treatment in vitro. We analyzed the peptides digested from total cellular proteins by reverse phase LC-MS/MS and then performed label-free quantitative analysis. We found 27 significantly up-regulated proteins in the ATPR group compared to the control group. NCF1 was the most significantly changed protein. Immunoprecipitation and double immunofluorescent staining showed that EBP50 bind to NCF1. We further explored the potential molecular mechanism of EBP50/NCF1 complex in ATPR-induced differentiation and G0/G1 phase arrest. The results showed that ATPR remarkably reduced the expression of EBP50 in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, the reduction of EBP50 contributed to ROS release by modulating the subcellular localization of NCF1. The reduction of EBP50 also contributed to G0/G1 phase arrest by inhibiting CyclinD1, CyclinA2 and CDK4, as well as promoting the differentiation of NB4 cells by increasing the expression of CD11b. Furthermore, we found that the overexpression of EBP50 restrained the effects of ATPR on differentiation and G0/G1 phase arrest in NB4 cells. These results suggest that ATPR-induced differentiation and G0/G1 phase arrest in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) by repressing EBP50/NCF1 complex to promote the production of ROS, and the results from in vivo experiments were consistent with those from in vitro studies. Therefore, our finding results suggest that EBP50 may be a new target for ATPR in the treatment of APL.

Diagnostic value of serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, interleukin-6 and anti-citrullinated alpha-enolase peptide 1 for lower respiratory tract infections.||||||||The aim of this study was to explore the auxiliary diagnostic value of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and anti-citrullinated alpha-enolase peptide 1 (CEP-1) in lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs).||||Blood samples were collected from 99 in-patients with LRTIs [62 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), 14 acute exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (AECOPD), 23 other diseases] and 50 healthy subjects. NGAL, CEP-1 and IL-6 were measured and compared. IL-6 was tested by electrochemiluminescence assay kit on Roche E601 immunology analyzer, CEP-1 was assessed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, and NGAL was detected by latex immunoturbidimetric assay kit on Beckman Coulter AU2700.||||Compared with healthy controls, NGAL and IL-6 levels were significantly increased in the patients with LRTIs, the area under the curves (AUC) was 0.97 and 0.88 respectively (P < 0.01). The sensitivity and specificity of NGAL at a cut-off of 86 ng/ml were 93.0% and 96.0%, respectively, in which the sensitivity was consistent with IL-6 (P = 0.21) and the specificity was better than IL-6 (P < 0.01). CEP-1 slightly increases in the patient group, however the difference was not significant (P = 0.41). The levels of NGAL and IL-6 was no differences in different diseases, the P-value was 0.50 and 0.29, respectively. LRTIs with and without underlying diseases have similar NGAL and IL-6 values.||||NGAL, rather than CEP-1, may be appealing adjuncts for diagnosis of LRTIs. NGAL proved to be a better biomarker than IL-6.

Meningioma-like Tumor of the Skin Revisited: A Distinct CD34+ Dermal Tumor With an Expanded Histologic Spectrum.||||||||The term meningioma-like tumor of the skin (MLTS) was coined in 1993 to designate a particular whorled spindle cell superficial cutaneous tumor. No additional confirmed cases of this entity have been reported to date. Some authors have speculated that these cases might be cellular neurothekeomas. In order to delineate the histologic spectrum and the immunophenotype of this unusual tumor, we studied 5 cases, 2 previously unreported and the 3 original cases. The immunohistochemical findings of case 5, however, were limited to those from the original study. Clinically, the tumor presented as a reddish papule, plaque, or nodule, located in the extremities or trunk. The patient often referred to a recent growth of a longstanding lesion. Histologically, the characteristic whorled spindle and stellate dendritic cell population, commonly in a perivascular arrangement, and variable myxoid component, were consistently found in all cases. A prominent microvasculature was also a constant finding. The presence of large deciduoid cells was conspicuous in one case. A reticular pattern of multivacuolated cells giving a chordoma-like appearance was evident in another case. Tumor cells were diffusely positive for CD34 in all 4 cases studied, and negative for S-100, EMA, NKI-C3, CD68, and smooth muscle markers. No complete loss of retinoblastoma protein was found. No brachyury immunostaining was found in the case with chordoid features. No EWSR1 or NAB2-STAT6 gene fusions were found. From these findings, we demonstrate that MLTS is a distinct CD34 spindle cell benign dermal tumor, unrelated to cellular neurothekeoma, and exhibiting myxoid, deciduoid, or chordoma-like features.

Identification of cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus P4.9 as a possible movement protein.||||||||Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus (CCYV) is a bipartite cucurbit-infecting crinivirus within the family Closteroviridae. The crinivirus genome varies among genera. P4.9 is the first protein encoded by CCYV RNA2. P5, which is encoded by LIYV, is necessary for efficient viral infectivity in plants; however, it remains unknown whether CCYV P4.9 is involved in movement.||||In this study, we used green fluorescent protein (GFP) to examine the intracellular distribution of P4.9-GFP in plant cells, and observed fluorescence in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Transient expression of P4.9 was localized to the plasmodesmata. Co-infiltration of agrobacterium carrying binary plasmids of P4.9 and GFP facilitated GFP diffusion between cells. Besides P4.9 was able to spread by itself to neighboring cells, and co-localized with a marker specific to the endoplasmic reticulum, HDEL-mCherry, but not with the Golgi marker Man49-mCherry.||||Together, these results demonstrate that CCYV P4.9 is involved in cell-cell movement.

A combination of the immunohistochemical markers CK7 and SATB2 is highly sensitive and specific for distinguishing primary ovarian mucinous tumors from colorectal and appendiceal metastases.||||||||. This study assesses the addition of a novel marker SATB2, to improve the diagnostic algorithm. A test cohort included 155 ovarian mucinous tumors (105 carcinomas and 50 borderline tumors) and 230 primary lower gastrointestinal neoplasms (123 colorectal adenocarcinomas and 107 appendiceal neoplasms). All cases were assessed for SATB2, PAX8 CK7, CK20, and CDX2 expression on tissue microarrays. Expression was scored in a 3-tier system as absent, focal (1-50% of tumor cells) and diffuse ( >50% of tumor cells) and then categorized into either absent/present or nondiffuse/diffuse. SATB2 and PAX8 expression was further evaluated in ovarian tumors from an international cohort of 2876 patients (expansion cohort, including 159 mucinous carcinomas and 46 borderline mucinous tumors). The highest accuracy of an individual marker in distinguishing lower gastrointestinal from ovarian mucinous tumors was CK7 (91.7%, nondiffuse/diffuse cut-off) followed by SATB2 (88.8%, present/absent cut-off). The most effective combination was CK7 and SATB2 with accuracy of 95.3% using the 3-tier interpretation, absent/focal/diffuse. This combination outperformed the standard clinical set of CK7, CK20 and CDX2 (87.5%). Re-evaluation of outlier cases confirmed ovarian origin for all but one case. The accuracy of SATB2 was confirmed in the expansion cohort (91.5%). SATB2 expression was also detected in 15% of ovarian endometrioid carcinoma but less than 5% of other ovarian histotypes. A simple two marker combination of CK7 and SATB2 can distinguish lower gastrointestinal from ovarian primary mucinous tumors with greater than 95% accuracy. PAX8 and CDX2 have value as second-line markers. The utility of CK20 in this setting is low and this warrants replacement of this marker with SATB2 in clinical practice.

[Structural-functional diversity of p53 proteoforms].||||||||Protein p53 is one of the most studied proteins. This attention is primarily due to its key role in the cellular mechanisms associated with carcinogenesis. Protein p53 is a transcription factor involved in a wide variety of processes: cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, signaling inside the cell, DNA repair, coordination of metabolic processes, regulation of cell interactions, etc. This multifunctionality is apparently determined by the fact that p53 is a vivid example of how the same protein can be represented by numerous proteoforms bearing completely different functional loads. By alternative splicing, using different promoters and translation initiation sites, the TP53 gene gives rise to at least 12 isoforms, which can additionally undergo numerous (>200) post-translational modifications. Proteoforms generated due to numerous point mutations in the TP53 gene are adding more complexity to this picture. The proteoforms produced are involved in various processes, such as the regulation of p53 transcriptional activity in response to various factors. This review is devoted to the description of the currently known p53 proteoforms, as well as their possible functionality.

Duration of symptoms ranged from 2 to 36 months (mean: 9.3 months). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was most frequent, followed by extranodal marginal zone lymphoma. Most DLBCLs were nongerminal center type. BCL2 was positive in all DLBCLs. Strong p53 immunopositivity was not seen in any of the cases analyzed.||||Histopathological evaluation supplemented by IHC is the gold standard for the diagnosis of PTL. Combined chemoradiotherapy appears to be the best treatment modality, irrespective of histological type. MIB-1 and MUM1 IHC may have a role in identifying DLBCL, particularly in small biopsies.

SCAF4 and SCAF8, mRNA Anti-Terminator Proteins.||||||||Accurate regulation of mRNA termination is required for correct gene expression. Here, we describe a role for SCAF4 and SCAF8 as anti-terminators, suppressing the use of early, alternative polyadenylation (polyA) sites. The SCAF4/8 proteins bind the hyper-phosphorylated RNAPII C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) phosphorylated on both Ser2 and Ser5 and are detected at early, alternative polyA sites. Concomitant knockout of human SCAF4 and SCAF8 results in altered polyA selection and subsequent early termination, leading to expression of truncated mRNAs and proteins lacking functional domains and is cell lethal. While SCAF4 and SCAF8 work redundantly to suppress early mRNA termination, they also have independent, non-essential functions. SCAF8 is an RNAPII elongation factor, whereas SCAF4 is required for correct termination at canonical, distal transcription termination sites in the presence of SCAF8. Together, SCAF4 and SCAF8 coordinate the transition between elongation and termination, ensuring correct polyA site selection and RNAPII transcriptional termination in human cells.

Obesity and childhood asthma in male schoolchildren in Saudi Arabia: Is there a role for leptin, interleukin-4, interleukin-5, and interleukin-21?||||||||Adiposity is associated with high serum levels of adipokines and chemokines which are possibly implicated in a co-existence of obesity and asthma.||||Elucidate the possible roles of leptin, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-21 in linking obesity with childhood asthma.||||Cross-sectional, analytical.||||Population of schoolchildren in a small Saudi city.||||The study included a representative sample of Saudi schoolchildren grouped as obese asthmatics, non-obese asthmatics, or obese nonasthmatics, with nonobese nonasthmatics as a control group.

Leptin levels were weakly but significantly correlated with the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-21.||||Leptin may contribute to a link between obesity and childhood asthma. Differences in IL-21 levels between nonobese and obese asthmatics suggest that the co-existence of asthma and obesity increased IL-21 levels. Leptin plus some proinflammatory cytokines especially IL-21 may be potential predictors for asthma control in children.||||Blood sampling at different stages of asthma might influence cytokine expression.||||None.

SPAG9 promotes prostate cancer proliferation and metastasis via MAPK signaling pathway.||||||||Prostate cancer (PCa) is a worldwide malignant tumor which seriously threats the reproductive health of middle-aged and senior male. Sperm-associated antigen 9 (SPAG9), which belongs to the cancer testis (CT) antigen, overexpressed in multiple human malignant tumors and promoted tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis. However, little attention has been focused on the relationship between SPAG9 and PCa. SPAG9 protein level was measured by immunohistochemical staining in the PCa tissues. SPAG9 mRNA and protein expression were investigated in various PCa cells by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Depletion and overexpression of SPAG9 were proceeded in PCa cells to evaluate their effects by various malignant approaches in vitro and in vivo. SPAG9 was significantly upregulated in the PCa tissues, mainly expressed in the cytoplasm and occasionally in the nucleus of some cells, while SPAG9 was not detected in normal prostate tissue. SPAG9 protein was detected in three PCa cells. Furthermore, these results revealed that upregulation of SPAG9 could promote cell proliferation, migration, motility and cycle of PC-3 cell line, vice versa, downregulation of SPAG9 resulted in the opposite effect. In vivo, knockout of SPAG9 expression induced suppression of tumor growth in athymic nude mice. In summary, the present study indicated that SPAG9 was closely related to the Gleason scores of PCa. SPAG9 could promote cell proliferation, migration, motility and cell cycle via MAPK signaling pathway, suggesting that SPAG9 may be a potential therapeutic target for PCa.

Long non-coding RNA RP11-468E2.5 curtails colorectal cancer cell proliferation and stimulates apoptosis via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by targeting STAT5 and STAT6.||||||||Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are tumor-associated biological molecules and have been found to be implicated in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aims to examine the effects of lncRNA RP11-468E2.5 and its target genes (STAT5 and STAT6) on the biological activities of CRC cells via the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway.||||We initially screened the GEO database for differentially expressed lncRNAs related to CRC and then made a prediction of the implicated target genes. Then we collected CRC tissues and adjacent normal tissues from 169 CRC patients. Human CRC HCT116 and SW480 cells were treated with small interference RNA (siRNA) against RP11-468E2.5, AG490 (an inhibitor of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway), or both in combination. Next, we measured the effects of RP11-468E2.5 treatment on cellular activities such as cell viability, cycle distribution and cell apoptosis, and studied interactions among RP11-468E2.5, STAT5/STAT6, and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Finally, an in vivo tumor formation assay was performed to observe the effect of RP11-468E2.5 on tumor growth.||||The CRC-related gene microarray data showed low expression of RP11-468E2.5 in CRC surgical specimens. However, RP11-468E2.5 was confirmed to target STAT5 and STAT6, which participate in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. CRC tissues showed lower expression of RP11-468E2.5, higher expression of STAT5, STAT6 and of the cell cycle marker Cyclin D1 (CCND1), compared to the findings in adjacent normal tissues. The treatment of siRNA against RP11-468E2.5 increased expression of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5, STAT6, CCND1 and Bcl-2 along with the extent of STAT3, STAT5 and STAT6 phosphorylation, while lowering expression of P21 and P27. Treatment with AG490 exhibited approximately opposite effects, whereas siRNA against RP11-468E2.5 treatment stimulated CRC cell proliferation and reduced cell apoptosis, while promoting cell cycle entry; AG490 treatment reversed these results.||||Altogether, we conclude that up-regulation of RP11-468E2.5 inhibits the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by targeting STAT5 and STAT6, thereby suppressing cell proliferation and promoting cell apoptosis in CRC.

Repurposing Penfluridol in Combination with Temozolomide for the Treatment of Glioblastoma.||||||||Despite the presence of aggressive treatment strategies, glioblastoma remains intractable, warranting a novel therapeutic modality. An oral antipsychotic agent, penflurido (PFD), used for schizophrenia treatment, has shown an antitumor effect on various types of cancer cells. As glioma sphere-forming cells (GSCs) are known to mediate drug resistance in glioblastoma, and considering that antipsychotics can easily penetrate the blood-brain barrier, we investigated the antitumor effect of PFD on patient-derived GSCs. Using five GSCs, we found that PFD exerts an antiproliferative effect in a time- and dose-dependent manner. At IC50, spheroid size and second-generation spheroid formation were significantly suppressed. Stemness factors, SOX2 and OCT4, were decreased. PFD treatment reduced cancer cell migration and invasion by reducing the Integrin α6 and uPAR levels and suppression of the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) factors, vimentin and Zeb1. GLI1 was found to be involved in PFD-induced EMT inhibition. Furthermore, combinatorial treatment of PFD with temozolomide (TMZ) significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival in vivo. Immunostaining revealed decreased expression of GLI1, SOX2, and vimentin in the PFD treatment group but not in the TMZ-only treatment group. Therefore, PFD can be effectively repurposed for the treatment of glioblastoma by combining it with TMZ.

Synthesis, crystal structures, Hirshfeld surface analysis and spectroscopic studies of two Schiff bases of anisaldehyde and their urease and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory and antioxidant properties.||||||||The growing demand of pharmaceutical industry for more effective drugs requires new molecules with promising medicinal activities. In the present work, a natural product anisaldehyde was treated with hydrazine and 3,5-dichloroaniline to synthesize their Schiff bases, ASB1 and ASB2, which were assessed for various bioactivities. ASB1 was synthesized by conventional reflux method while ASB2 was synthesized by reflux as well as by mechanochemical grinding method which gave higher yield. The bases were recrystalised, and their structures were elucidated based on XRD and spectroscopic studies. Hirshfeld surface analysis was also carried out. They showed considerable urease inhibitory activity, almost comparable with the standard thiourea. The activity of ASB1 was much higher than ASB2. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity of ASB1 was also higher than that of ASB2. The antioxidant activities were determined using DPPH, ABTS radical scavenging and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) assays. The bases were very poor scavengers of DPPH radical. However, they showed considerable anti-radical activity against ABTS radical, ASB2 being more active than ASB1, while ASB1 showed higher TAC than ASB2. In conclusion, the bases appeared to have good drugability as inhibitors of urease and acetylcholinesterase enzymes. They can be easily synthesized for possible large-scale applications. The grinding method proved to be more efficient than the reflux method.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of the stable overexpression of Arr2 on the proliferation and apoptosis of human EC heterotransplants and the expression of associated molecules, including Toll-like receptor 2(TLR2), serine-threonine kinase Akt (Akt), glycogen synthase kinase-3β(GSK3β) and some typical inflammatory cytokines such as NF-κB p56, TNF-α and IL-6 & IL-8.||||Human EC cell line Ishikawa, stably transfected with Arr2 full-length plasmid, was injected subcutaneously into nude mice. They were treated with 0, 10, 20 mg/kg paclitaxel and the volume and weight of the tumor tissue were measured and calculated. The necrotic index were assessed by H&E staining and microscopic observation. The levels of caspase-3, caspase-9, TLR2, NF-κB p56, Akt, GSK3β were measured by western blot, and the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8 were measured by real-time PCR.||||We found that Arr2 overexpression promoted the growth of human EC heterotransplants. Arr2 attenuated the promotion of caspase-3 and caspase-9 by paclitaxel and mediated the increase of TLR2 and several inflammatory cytokines. The levels of Akt and GSK3β were not affected.||||Arr2 overexpression was associated with the increase of TLR2 and several inflammatory factors, meanwhile inhibited paclitaxel-induced anti-tumor effect on human EC heterotransplants.

Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) induces stem/progenitor cell growth in middle ear mucosa.||||||||The middle ear epithelium is derived from the neural crest and endoderm, which line distinct regions of the middle ear cavity. In this study, we investigated the localization of stem/progenitor cells in the middle ear mucosa of adult mice and the effects of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) on the cell kinetics of stem/progenitor cells in vivo.||||In this study, after KGF-expression vector was transfected in the ear, two kinds of thymidine analogues, BrdU and EdU, were transferred at different time points. BrdU was detected by immunohistochemistry and EdU was detected by click chemistry. We also performed immunohistochemistry using anti-Keratin14 (K14) antibody (an undifferentiated epithelial cell marker), anti-p63 antibody (a stem/progenitor cell marker) and anti-acetylated α-tubulin antibody (a ciliated epithelial cell marker).||||A large number of EdU-positive cells were detected in the thickened mucosal epithelium of the pars flaccida and attic region at Day 1 after KGF transfection. Interestingly, in the mucosal epithelium overlying the promontory of the cochlea, many EdU-positive cells were detected. These cells were also positive for K14 and p63. The acetylated α-tubulin positive cells were reduced in the attic region at Day 1 after KGF transfection.||||These findings indicate that KGF over-expression may increase stem/progenitor cell proliferation in the mucosal epithelium not only within the attic which is typical in middle ear cholesteatoma, but also overlying the promontory of the cochlea.

Targeted lipid nanoparticle delivery of calcitriol to human monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro and in vivo: investigation of the anti-inflammatory effects of calcitriol.|||||||| possesses anti-inflammatory and modulatory properties in addition to its role in calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Upon activation, macrophages (M) can initiate and sustain pro-inflammatory cytokine production in inflammatory disorders and play a pathogenic role in certain cancers.||||The main purpose of this study was to encapsulate and specifically target calcitriol to macrophages and investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of calcitriol in vitro and in vivo.||||In this study we have designed and developed near-infrared calcitriol PEGylated nanoparticles (PEG-LNP(Cal)) using a microfluidic mixing technique and modified lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to target the M specific endocytic receptor CD163. We have investigated LNP cellular uptake and anti-inflammatory effect in LPS-induced M in vitro by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and gene expression analyses. LNP pharmacodynamics, bio-distribution and organ specific LNP accumulation was also investigated in mice in vivo.||||In vitro, we observed the specific uptake of PEG-LNP(Cal)-hCD163 in human M, which was significantly higher than the non-specific uptake of control PEG-LNP(Cal)-IgG(h) in M. Pretreatment with encapsulated calcitriol was able to attenuate intracellular TNF-expression, and M surface marker HLA-DR expression more efficiently than free calcitriol in LPS-induced M in vitro. Encapsulated calcitriol diminished mRNA gene levels of TNF-, NF-B, MCP-1 and IL-6, while upregulating IL-10. TNF- and IL-6 protein secretion also decreased. In mice, an in vivo pharmacodynamic study of PEG-LNP(Cal) showed a rapid clearance of IgG and CD163 modified LNPs compared to PEG-LNP(Cal). Antibody modified PEG-LNP(Cal) accumulated in the liver, spleen and kidney, whereas unmodified PEG-LNP(Cal) accumulation was only observed in the liver.||||Our results show that calcitriol can be effectively targeted to M. Our data confirms the anti-inflammatory properties of calcitriol and this may be a potential way to deliver high dose bioactive calcitriol to M during inflammation in vivo.

Phosphorylated Heat Shock Protein 27 Inhibits Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammation in Thp1 Cells by Promoting TLR4 Endocytosis, Ubiquitination, and Degradation.||||||||The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of Hsp27 on LPS-induced inflammation and identify the precise mechanisms about how Hsp27 regulates LPS-induced TLR4 signaling in Thp1 cells. Thp1 cells were transfected with Flag-Hsp27 or pcDNA3.1, and then treated with LPS for indicated time. TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were determined by ELISA. The protein levels of Hsp27, p-Hsp27 (Ser15, Ser78, and Ser82), and TLR4 were measured by Western blotting. In vitro study showed that over-expression of Hsp27 downregulated the release of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and suppressed the activation of TLR4 signals after stimulated by LPS. The location of TLR4 and RAB5 was detected by confocal microscopy. Immunoprecipitation was used to determine the ubiquitination and degradation of TLR4 and interaction between Hsp27 and TLR4. Results showed that Hsp27 could promote TLR4 endocytosis and ubiquitination and degradation. Further research revealed that Hsp27 was phosphorylated after LPS, only phosphorylated Hsp27 can interact with TLR4 and inhibit the activation of TLR4 signaling, which was demonstrated by inhibition of Hsp27 phosphorylation with inhibitors or transfection of Hsp27 mutants into Thp1 cells. Phosphorylated Hsp27 reduced the release of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, and suppressed the activation of TLR4 signaling by promoting TLR4 endocytosis, ubiquitination, and degradation.

Trimming PolyQ proteins with engineered PML.||||||||Protein abnormalities are the major cause of neurodegenerative diseases such as spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). Protein misfolding and impaired degradation leads to the build-up of protein aggregates inside the cell, which may further cause cellular degeneration. Reducing levels of either the soluble misfolded form of the protein or its precipitated aggregate, even marginally, could significantly improve cellular health. Despite numerous pre-existing strategies to target these protein aggregates, there is considerable room to improve their specificity and efficiency. In this study, we demonstrated the enhanced intracellular degradation of both monomers and aggregates of mutant ataxin1 (Atxn1 82Q) by engineering an E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme, promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). Specifically, we showed enhanced degradation of both soluble and aggregated Atxn1 82Q in mammalian cells by targeting this protein using PML fused to single chain variable fragments (scFvs) specific for monomers and aggregates of the target protein. The ability to solubilize Atxn1 82Q aggregates was due to the PML-mediated enhanced SUMOylation of the target protein. This ability to reduce the intracellular levels of both misfolded forms of Atxn1 82Q may not only be useful for treating SCA, but also applicable for the treatment of other PolyQ disorders.

Insulin and adipokine signaling and their cross-regulation in postmortem human brain.||||||||Aberrant insulin and adipokine signaling has been implicated in cognitive decline associated with both type 2 diabetes mellitus and neurodegenerative diseases. We established methods that reliably measure insulin, adiponectin and leptin signaling, and their crosstalk, in thawed postmortem mid-frontal cortical tissue from cognitively normal older subjects with a short postmortem interval. Insulin-evoked insulin receptor (IR) activation increases activated, tyrosine-phosphorylated IRβ on tyrosine residues 960, 1150, and 1151, insulin receptor substrate-1 recruitment to IRβ and phosphorylated RAC-α-serine/threonine-protein kinase. Adiponectin augments, but leptin inhibits, insulin signaling. Adiponectin activates adiponectin receptors to induce APPL1 binding to adiponectin receptor 1 and 2 and T-cadherin and downstream adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation. Insulin inhibited adiponectin-induced signaling. In addition, leptin-induced leptin receptor (OB-R) signaling promotes Janus kinase 2 recruitment to OB-R and Janus kinase 2 and downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation. Insulin enhanced leptin signaling. These data demonstrate insulin and adipokine signaling interactions in human brain. Future studies can use these methods to examine insulin, adiponectin, and leptin metabolic dysregulation in aging and disease states, such as type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias.

In order to fulfill the demand from preclinical and clinical studies, we developed an automated one-pot two-step synthesis of this potent tau imaging agent and studied its stability, and dosimetry in mice and monkeys. We also conducted a preliminary study of this imaging agent in humans. Using this one-pot two-step method, the radiochemical yield (RCY) of [18F]T807 was 20.5 ± 6.1% (n = 15) at the end of bombardment (EOB) in a synthesis time of 70±5 min. The chemical and radiochemical purities were >90% and the specific activities were 151 ± 52 GBq/μmol. The quality of [18F]T807 synthesized by this method met the U.S. Pharmacopoeia (USP) criteria. The stability test showed that the [18F]T807 injection was stable at room temperature for up to 4 h after the end of synthesis (EOS). The estimated effective dose of the [18F]T807 injection extrapolated from monkeys was 19 μSv/MBq (n = 2), while the estimated effective doses of the [18F]T807 injection extrapolated from fasted and non-fasted mice were 123 ± 27 (n = 3) and 94 ± 19 (n = 4) μSv/MBq, respectively. This one-pot two-step automated method produced the [18F]T807 injection with high reproducibility and high quality. PET imaging and radiation dosimetry evaluation in mice and Formosan rock monkeys suggested that the [18F]T807 injection synthesized by this method is suitable for use in human PET imaging studies. Thus, this method could fulfill the demand for the [18F]T807 injection in both preclinical and clinical studies of tauopathies, especially for nearby study sites without cyclotrons.

C1q/TNF-related protein-3 or CTRP3 is a novel adipokine that is expressed and released by most types of human tissues including adipose tissue. This adipokine, considered as an adiponectin, can normalize blood glucose by several mechanisms. In addition, it can modulate the expression/secretion of other cytokine and adipokines leading to lower insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Beneficial effects of CTRP3 against hyperglycemia-induced complications in the kidney and eye have been reported. In this review, we have presented the latest findings on the in vitro and in vivo hypoglycemic effects of CTRP3, followed by the findings on the preventive/therapeutic effects of CTRP3 adipokines against diabetes related complications.

Ginger-Degraded Collagen Hydrolysate Exhibits Antidepressant Activity in Mice.||||||||Collagen is the most abundant protein in animals. Collagen hydrolysate has been found to have multiple functions in the skin, bones, joints, muscles, and blood vessels. Recently, it has been reported that the low molecular weight fraction of collagen hydrolysate exhibited anxiolytic activity, suggesting that collagen peptides affect brain functions. In the present study, we found that oral administration of ginger-degraded collagen hydrolysate (GDCH) significantly decreased depression-like behavior in a forced swim test, suggesting that GDCH exhibited antidepressant activity in mice. The antidepressant activity of GDCH was abolished by pre-treatment with an antagonist of the dopamine receptor, but not treatment with a serotonin receptor antagonist. GDCH significantly increased gene expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) in the hippocampus, molecules that affect the differentiation and survival of neurons, relative to that in the control condition. Meanwhile, there were no changes in the gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, and neurotrophin-3, major factors related to depression-like behavior. We also found that GDCH exhibited antidepressant activity in corticosterone-administered mice in a model of stress. In addition, GDCH increased GDNF and CNTF expression in the stressed condition, suggesting that mechanisms of the antidepressant activity of GDCH were the same in unstressed and stressed conditions. These results imply that GDCH exhibits antidepressant activity in unstressed and stressed conditions in mice. The upregulation of neurotrophic genes in the hippocampus may contribute to the reduction of depression-like behavior via a dopamine signal pathway modulated by GDCH.

Evaluation of the association of Wnt signaling with coronary artery calcification in patients on dialysis with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism.||||||||Patients with end-stage renal disease have a higher risk of death from cardiovascular events, which can be mainly attributed to coronary artery calcification (CAC). Wnt signaling is involved in vascular development and may play a role in vascular calcification. This study aimed to evaluate CAC prevalence in patients on dialysis with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) and identify CAC risk factors.||||The study is a retrospective analysis of the severe hyperparathyroidism registration study that prospectively recruited patients on dialysis with severe SHPT who were candidates for parathyroidectomy, from October 2013 to May 2015. CAC and bone mineral density (BMD) were measured. Demographic and clinical data including calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, intact parathyroid hormone, Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1), and sclerostin levels were analyzed. CAC scores were reported in Agatston units (AU).||||A total of 61 patients were included in this study. No CAC, mild CAC (<100 AU), moderate CAC (>100 AU), and severe CAC (>400 AU) were observed in 4.9%, 11.4%, 14.8%, and 68.9% of patients, respectively. DKK1 and sclerostin were not associated with CAC. In univariate analysis, CAC was significantly correlated with age, sex (male), total cholesterol, and intravenous pulse calcitriol (p<0.05). CAC was not inversely correlated with the BMD, T scores, or Z scores of the femoral neck (p>0.05). In multivariate analysis, the stepwise forward multiple linear regression revealed that CAC was associated with age, male sex and intravenous pulse calcitriol (p<0.05). Furthermore, serum sclerostin was positively correlated with the BMD of the femoral neck but negatively associated with intact parathyroid hormone (p<0.05). Serum sclerostin was significantly associated with severely low bone mass with Z-scores<-2.5 of the femoral neck, even when adjusted for serum intact parathyroid hormone, vitamin D status, dialysis pattern, sex, and DKK-1 (p<0.05).||||The patients on dialysis with severe SHPT have a high prevalence of vascular calcification. Although the Wnt signaling pathway could play a role in hyperparathyroid bone disease, CAC may be mainly due to the treatment modality rather than the Wnt signaling pathway associated bone metabolism in patients on dialysis with severe SHPT.

Roles of organic anion transporter 2 and equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 in hepatic disposition and antiviral activity of entecavir during non-pregnancy and pregnancy.||||||||Entecavir (ETV), a first-line antiviral drug against hepatitis B virus (HBV), has the possibility to be used to prevent mother-to-child transmission. The aim of present study was to clarify the mechanism of ETV uptake into hepatocytes and evaluate the alteration of ETV's hepatic distribution during pregnancy.||||The roles of equilibrative nucleotide transporter (ENT) 1 and organic anion transporter (OAT) 2 in ETV accumulation and anti-HBV efficacy were studied in human ENT1 or OAT2 overexpressed cell models and HepG2.2.15 cells, respectively; meanwhile, the liver-to-plasma ETV concentration ratios in non-pregnant and pregnant mice were measured to evaluate the effect of pregnancy on ETV hepatic distribution.||||ETV was shown to be a substrate of ENT1 and OAT2. An ENT1 inhibitor significantly decreased the efficacy of ETV in HepG2.2.15 cells, while overexpression of OAT2 increased susceptibility of HBV to ETV. The liver-to-plasma ETV concentration ratios in pregnant mice were sharply reduced; whereas, the absolute concentration of ETV in the liver did not obviously alter in pregnancy. Although oestradiol and progesterone showed a concentration-dependent inhibition on ETV accumulation both in hepatic cell lines and in primary human hepatocytes, a physiologically relevant concentration of oestradiol and progesterone did not affect antiviral activity of ETV.||||OAT2 and ENT1 are the main transporters involved in the hepatic uptake and anti-HBV efficacy of ETV. The concentration of ETV in the liver was not obviously altered during pregnancy, which indicates that dosage adjustment in pregnancy is not necessary.

High dose rosuvastatin increases ABCA1 transporter in human atherosclerotic plaques in a cholesterol-independent fashion.||||||||ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) and G1 (ABCG1) mediate cholesterol efflux from lipid-laden macrophages, thus promoting anti-atherosclerotic outcomes. The mechanism(s) linking treatment with statins and ABCA1/ABCG1 in human atherosclerosis are not fully understood and require further investigation. Therefore, we studied whether short-term treatment with low- or high-dose rosuvastatin may affect ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression in human atherosclerotic plaques.||||Seventy patients with severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery were randomized to receive low (10 mg/day) or high (40 mg/day) dose rosuvastatin for 12 weeks before elective endarterectomy. As controls, we analyzed a reference group of 10 plaques from subjects with hypercholesterolemia but not receiving statin treatment and an additional set of 11 plaques collected from normocholesterolemic patients. On atherosclerotic plaques, ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression was evaluated at RNA level by qPCR and at protein level by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry.||||Both rosuvastatin doses were associated with lower plaque ABCA1 mRNA levels and with a trend toward reduction for ABCG1. However, ABCA1 protein was paradoxically higher in patients treated with high-dose rosuvastatin and was associated with lower levels of miR-33b-5p, a microRNA known as a regulator of ABCA1. Multivariate analyses showed that the effect is cholesterol-independent. Finally, no effects were found for ABCG1 protein.||||High-dose rosuvastatin increases macrophage ABCA1 protein levels in human atherosclerotic plaque despite mRNA reduction in a mechanism unrelated to plasma cholesterol reduction and potentially involving miR-33b-5p. This pathway may reflect an additional feature contributing to the anti-atherosclerotic effect for high-dose rosuvastatin.||||ISRCTN16590640.

Probucol promotes high glucose-induced proliferation and inhibits apoptosis by reducing reactive oxygen species generation in Müller cells.||||||||To explore the protective effect of probucol on human retinal Müller cells cultured in high glucose.||||Primary Müller cells from human retinas were cultured in complete DMEM. Third-generation Müller cells were identified using glutamine synthetase (GS) antibody and randomly divided into three groups: normoglycemia (NG, 5.5 mmol/L); hyperglycemia (HG, 30 mmol/L); and hyperglycemia (30 mmol/L) with probucol (10 μmol/L; HGPB). After a 24-h intervention, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured with a CCK-8 kit, flow cytometry, and DCFH-DA probe, respectively. Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) protein expression were detected by immunofluorescence staining.||||For NG, HG, and HGPB, optical density (OD) values for cell proliferation were 0.98 ± 0.23, 0.58 ± 0.11, and 0.73 ± 0.11; apoptotic rates were 2.79 ± 0.52%, 7.70 ± 0.44%, and 4.00 ± 0.95%; and intracellular ROS were 20.89 ± 5.14, 55.17 ± 14.07, and 26.28 ± 4.73, respectively. Compared to NG, OD was markedly decreased (P < 0.01), apoptosis was increased (P < 0.001), and intracellular ROS level was significantly higher than in HG (P < 0.01).

CDK5-dependent phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TRIM59 promotes macroH2A1 ubiquitination and tumorigenicity.||||||||Despite the development of adjuvant therapies, glioblastoma (GBM) patients remain incurable, thus justifying the urgent need of new therapies. CDK5 plays a critical role in GBM and is a potential target for GBM. However, the mechanism by which CDK5 promotes GBM tumorigenicity remains largely unknown. Here, we identify TRIM59 as a substrate of CDK5. EGFR-activated CDK5 directly binds to and phosphorylates TRIM59, a ubiquitin ligase at serine 308, which recruits PIN1 for cis-trans isomerization of TRIM59, leading to TRIM59 binding to importin α5 and nuclear translocation. Nuclear TRIM59 induces ubiquitination and degradation of the tumor suppressive histone variant macroH2A1, leading to enhanced STAT3 signaling activation and tumorigenicity. These findings are confirmed by inhibition of CDK5-activated TRIM59 activity that results in suppression of intracranial tumor growth. Correlative expressions of the components of this pathway are clinically prognostic. Our findings suggest targeting CDK5/TRIM59 signaling axis as a putative strategy for treating GBM.

Expressions of C/EBPα and PPAR-γ were both negatively related with FOXC1 in human HCC tissue. Confocal displayed that C/EBPα was co-located with FOXC1 in HepG2 cells. C/EBPα could bind to FOXC1 promoter by ChIP. Luciferase activity detection exhibited that C/EBPα could inhibit FOXC1 promoter activity, especially FOXC1 promoter from -600 to -300 was the critical binding site. Only PPAR-γ couldn't influence luciferase activity but strengthen inhibited effect of C/EBPα. Further, the Co-IP displayed that PPAR-γ could bind to C/EBPα. When C/EBPα and PPAR-γ was both high expressed, cell proliferation, migration, invasion and colony information were inhibited enormously. C/EBPα plasmid combined with or without PPAR-γ agonist MDG548 treatment exhibited a strong tumor inhibition and FOXC1 suppression in mice.||||Our data establish C/EBPα targeting FOXC1 as potential determinant in the HCC, which supplies a new pathway to treat HCC. However, PPAR-γ has no effect on FOXC1 expression.

For a literature review, published clinical data derived from 74 patients with congenital i-TSHD resulting from single-gene mutations were retrieved and analyzed.||||Genetic screening of the 13 study subjects revealed six mutation-carrying patients (46%), including five hemizygous IGSF1 mutation carriers and one hemizygous TBL1X mutation carrier. Among the six mutation carriers, one had intellectual disability and the other one had obesity, but the remaining four did not show nonendocrine phenotypes. Loss of function of the TBL1X mutation (p.Asn382del) was confirmed in vitro. The literature review demonstrated etiology-specific relationship between serum prolactin (PRL) levels and TRH-stimulated TSH levels with some degree of overlap.||||The mutation screening study covering the five causative genes of congenital i-TSHD was performed, showing that the IGSF1 defect was the leading genetic cause of the disease. Assessing relationships between serum PRL levels and TRH-stimulated TSH levels would contribute to predict the etiologies of congenital i-TSHD.

LABAs and p38MAPK Inhibitors Reverse the Corticosteroid-Insensitivity of IL-8 in Airway Smooth Muscle Cells of COPD.||||||||Airway inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is partially insensitive/resistant to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). ICS plus bronchodilator therapy has been discussed for COPD phenotypes with frequent exacerbations and participation of corticosteroid-sensitive type 2/eosinophilic inflammation. Neutralization of non-type 2/IL-8-associated airway inflammation by reversion of its corticosteroid-resistance might be a future strategy for other phenotypes. Human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) produce corticosteroid-insensitive IL-8 in response to TNFα or LPS in stable disease stages or bacteria-induced exacerbations, respectively. p38-mitogen-activated-protein-kinases (p38MAPKs) are alternative therapeutic targets. Hypothesis: long-acting-β2-agonists (LABAs) reverse the corticosteroid-insensitivity of IL-8 by p38MAPK inhibition in HASMCs. Cultivated HASMCs from COPD subjects were pre-incubated with formoterol, salmeterol, fluticasone-propionate, BIRB796 (p38MAPKα, -γ, -δ inhibitor), and/or SB203580 (p38MAPKα and -β inhibitor) before stimulation with TNFα or LPS. IL-8 and MAPK-activities were measured by ELISA. Formoterol, salmeterol, and fluticasone did not or hardly reduced TNFα- or LPS-induced IL-8. BIRB796 and SB203580 reduced TNFα-induced IL-8. SB203580 reduced LPS-induced IL-8. Fluticasone/formoterol, fluticasone/salmeterol, and fluticasone/BIRB796, but not fluticasone/SB203580 combinations, reduced TNFα-induced IL-8 stronger than single treatments. All combinations including fluticasone/SB203580 reduced LPS-induced IL-8 stronger than single treatments. TNFα induced p38MAPKα and -γ activity. LPS induced p38MAPKα activity. Formoterol reduced TNFα-induced p38MAPKγ and LPS-induced p38MAPKα activity. LABAs reverse the corticosteroid-insensitivity of IL-8 in airway smooth muscles via p38MAPKγ in stable disease and via p38MAPKα in exacerbations. Our pre-clinical data indicate a utility for also adding ICS in non-type 2 inflammatory COPD phenotypes to bronchodilator therapy. Depending on phenotype and disease stage, isoform-specific p38MAPK blockers might also reverse corticosteroid-resistance in COPD.

CAMTA-1 Expression in 24 Cases of Hepatic Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma in a Single Institute: Diagnostic Utility for Differential Diagnosis from Hepatic Angiosarcoma.||||||||Epithelioid hemangio-endothelioma (EHE) of the liver is an uncommon vascular tumor with variable clinical courses ranging from stable disease to fatal outcome. EHE can mimic epithelioid angiosarcoma, which has a more aggressive behavior, especially in a small biopsy sample. EHEs are known to have the WWTR1-CAMTA1 fusion gene, and nuclear expression of CAMTA1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been reported in about 90% of EHEs in multiple organs. Our study aimed to validate the diagnostic utility of CAMTA1 expression in EHEs, especially in the liver.||||IHC was performed using anti-CAMTA1 antibody in 34 tumors (24 hepatic EHEs and 10 angiosarcomas). In CAMTA1-negative EHEs, TFE3 IHC was performed.||||Of the 24 hepatic EHEs, 22 (91.6%) showed nuclear staining for CAMTA1. One of two CAMTA1-negative cases showed TFE3 positivity. The other case was negative for TFE3. Meanwhile, all 10 angiosarcoma cases had no CAMTA1 expression.||||CAMTA1 is a highly sensitive and specific marker for diagnosis of hepatic EHE. It is helpful for differentiation of hepatic EHE and angiosarcoma, especially in small biopsy samples.

MiR-202-5p/MATN2 are associated with regulatory T-cells differentiation and function in allergic rhinitis.||||||||Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a crucial role in allergic rhinitis (AR). However, the mechanism of how Tregs are regulated in AR is poorly understood. Here, we aimed to explore the role of Tregs in AR and how Tregs were regulated by miR-202-5P, which was demonstrated to be important in AR. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from collected blood samples. Tregs were purified using Regulatory T Cell Isolation Kit, and differentiated from isolated CD4 T cells using recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). mRNA expression levels of miR-202-5p, matrilin-2 (MATN2), TGF-β1 and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were detected by real-time PCR. The concentrations of IL-4, interleukin-17 (IL-17), IL-10, interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and TGF-β1 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). MATN2 protein level was detected by Western blot. MiR-202-5p expression dramatically elevated in PBMCs, CD4+ T cells and Tregs of AR patients. In vitro, miR-202-5p promoted Tregs differentiation via targeting MATN2. MiR-202-5p/MATN2 axis mediated Tregs proliferation and functions. MiR-202-5p/MATN2 are associated with regulatory T-cells differentiation and function in allergic rhinitis.

Measuring TREX1 and TREX2 exonuclease activities.||||||||Three-prime Repair Exonuclease (TREX1) degrades ssDNA and dsDNA. TREX1 localizes to the perinuclear space in cells and degrades cytosolic DNA to prevent aberrant nucleic acid sensing and immune activation in humans and mice. Mutations in the TREX1 gene cause a spectrum of human autoimmune diseases including Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, familial chilblain lupus, retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy, and are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. More than 60 disease-causing TREX1 variants have been identified including dominant and recessive, missense, and frameshift mutations that map to the catalytic core region and to the C-terminal cell localization region. The TREX1-disease causing mutations affect exonuclease activity at varied levels. In this chapter, we describe methods to purify variant recombinant TREX1 enzymes and measure the exonuclease activity using ssDNA and dsDNA substrates. The relationships between TREX1 activities, types of TREX1 mutations, and TREX1-associated autoimmune diseases are considered.

NGAL, CEP-1 and IL-6 were measured and compared. IL-6 was tested by electrochemiluminescence assay kit on Roche E601 immunology analyzer, CEP-1 was assessed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, and NGAL was detected by latex immunoturbidimetric assay kit on Beckman Coulter AU2700.||||Compared with healthy controls, NGAL and IL-6 levels were significantly increased in the patients with LRTIs, the area under the curves (AUC) was 0.97 and 0.88 respectively (P < 0.01). The sensitivity and specificity of NGAL at a cut-off of 86 ng/ml were 93.0% and 96.0%, respectively, in which the sensitivity was consistent with IL-6 (P = 0.21) and the specificity was better than IL-6 (P < 0.01). CEP-1 slightly increases in the patient group, however the difference was not significant (P = 0.41). The levels of NGAL and IL-6 was no differences in different diseases, the P-value was 0.50 and 0.29, respectively. LRTIs with and without underlying diseases have similar NGAL and IL-6 values.||||NGAL, rather than CEP-1, may be appealing adjuncts for diagnosis of LRTIs.

Baseline adenosine receptor mRNA expression in blood as predictor of response to methotrexate therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.||||||||Methotrexate (MTX) reduces inflammation by increasing extracellular adenosine levels in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Adenosine acts via G-protein coupled receptors; ADORA1, ADORA2a, ADORA2b and ADORA3. We studied if baseline expression of whole blood adenosine receptors can predict response to MTX. RA patients [American College of Rheumatology/European-League-Against-Rheumatism (EULAR) 2010 criteria], Disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) naïve with active disease [Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) > 3.2] were enrolled. Blood samples were collected at baseline (n = 100) and at 4 months after therapy (n = 50). Patients were treated with MTX monotherapy. Based on EULAR response, patients were categorized into three groups i.e. good, moderate and non-responders. Adenosine receptors gene expression (ADORA1, ADORA2a, ADORA2b and ADORA3) in whole-blood RNA was measured using real-time PCR. HPRT1 was used as housekeeping gene. Receptor expression at baseline was correlated with response to MTX. All values are expressed as median (interquartile range). Hundred patients [87% females; age 40 (18) years]; duration of disease 24 (24.75) months; DAS28 4.7 (1.25) were enrolled. Fifty-one were classified as good, 28 moderate and 21 as non-responders. No expression of ADORA1 and ADORA2b was detected. Significant difference was observed in the expression levels of ADORA3 between good vs non-responder (P = 0.03) and moderate vs non-responder (P = 0.002). On ROC curve analysis, ADORA3 with cut-off value of less than - 0.60 (ΔCt) predicted non-response to MTX treatment (AUC: 0.7, P = 0.006). ADORA3 mRNA levels in whole blood may serve as a biomarker of response to MTX.

[Structural-functional diversity of p53 proteoforms].||||||||Protein p53 is one of the most studied proteins. This attention is primarily due to its key role in the cellular mechanisms associated with carcinogenesis. Protein p53 is a transcription factor involved in a wide variety of processes: cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, signaling inside the cell, DNA repair, coordination of metabolic processes, regulation of cell interactions, etc. This multifunctionality is apparently determined by the fact that p53 is a vivid example of how the same protein can be represented by numerous proteoforms bearing completely different functional loads. By alternative splicing, using different promoters and translation initiation sites, the TP53 gene gives rise to at least 12 isoforms, which can additionally undergo numerous (>200) post-translational modifications. Proteoforms generated due to numerous point mutations in the TP53 gene are adding more complexity to this picture. The proteoforms produced are involved in various processes, such as the regulation of p53 transcriptional activity in response to various factors. This review is devoted to the description of the currently known p53 proteoforms, as well as their possible functionality.

In this study, we investigated the effect of IGF2, a growth factor in stem cells from apical papilla (SCAPs) niche, on differentiation and proliferation potentials of SCAPs.||||Recombinant human IGF2 protein (rhIGF2) was used. Cell counting kit-8 assay, Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester assay, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, Alizarin Red staining, quantitative calcium analysis, immunofluorescence staining and real-time RT-PCR were performed to investigate the cell proliferation and differentiation potentials of SCAPs. And proteomic analysis was used to identify the differential secreted proteins.||||By ALP activity assay, we found that 5 ng/mL rhIGF2 might be the optimal concentration for treatment. Then, Alizarin Red staining, quantitative calcium analysis and osteogenesis-related gene expression results showed that 5 ng/mL rhIGF2 could enhance the osteo-/dentinogenic differentiation potentials in SCAPs. Immunofluorescence staining and real-time RT-PCR results showed that neurogenic markers were significantly induced by 5 ng/mL rhIGF2 in SCAPs. Then, CCK-8 assay and CFSE assay results showed that 5 ng/mL rhIGF2 could enhance the cell proliferation in SCAPs. Furthermore, proteomic analysis showed that IGF2 could induce some secreted proteins which function related to the osteogenesis, neurogenesis and cell proliferation.||||Our results identified that IGF2 might be the potential mediator in niche to promote SCAP function and dental tissue regeneration.

We also sought to investigate the relation of resistin and CAP1 to carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), CD36 gene expression, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) circulating levels in ESRD patients and healthy controls.||||This study included 33 patients with ESRD and 27 healthy controls. Resistin and MMP-9 levels were measured by ELISA. Resistin, CAP1, and CD36 PBMC mRNA were measured by quantitative PCR.||||Our study showed that ESRD patients have significantly higher levels of circulatory resistin compared to healthy controls (p < 0.001), while there was no significant difference in resistin mRNA. A significant upregulation of CAP1 and CD36 was observed in the ESRD group (p < 0.001; p < 0.001).

Comparison of gingiva-derived and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells for osteogenesis.||||||||Presently, bone marrow is considered as a prime source of mesenchymal stem cells; however, there are some drawbacks and limitations. Compared with other mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) sources, gingiva-derived mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs) are abundant and easy to obtain through minimally invasive cell isolation techniques. In this study, MSCs derived from gingiva and bone marrow were isolated and cultured from mice. GMSCs were characterized by osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation, and flow cytometry. Compared with bone marrow MSCs (BMSCs), the proliferation capacity was judged by CCK-8 proliferation assay. Osteogenic differentiation was assessed by ALP staining, ALP assay and Alizarin red staining. RT-qPCR was performed for ALP, OCN, OSX and Runx2. The results indicated that GMSCs showed higher proliferative capacity than BMSCs. GMSCs turned more positive for ALP and formed a more number of mineralized nodules than BMSCs after osteogenic induction. RT-qPCR revealed that the expression of ALP, OCN, OSX and Runx2 was significantly increased in the GMSCs compared with that in BMSCs. Moreover, it was found that the number of CD90-positive cells in GMSCs elevated more than that of BMSCs during osteogenic induction. Taking these results together, it was indicated that GMSCs might be a promising source in the future bone tissue engineering.

Apocynin Attenuates Acute Kidney Injury and Inflammation in Rats with Acute Hypertriglyceridemic Pancreatitis.||||||||Acute hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis (HTGP) is more likely to be severe and complicated with extrapancreatic organ injury. NOX may be involved in the occurrence and development of high fat acute pancreatitis, but the specific mechanism is not clear.||||To investigate the protective effects of apocynin, an inhibitor of NOX, on kidney injury associated with the HTGP and its potential mechanisms in a rat model.||||In this study, HTGP rat model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of P-407 and L-Arg in combination. Apocynin was given by subcutaneously injection 30 min before the model was induced. The pancreatic and renal histopathology changes were analyzed. Serum AMY, BUN, Cr levels were measured by the Automatic Biochemistry Analyzer. The expression levels of protein associated with NOX/Akt pathway in the kidney were detected. ROS level in kidney and serum was measured by DHE staining and MDA, SOD kits, respectively. Serum TNF-α and IL-6 were detected by ELISA kits.||||In HTGP group, the levels of serum AMY, BUN, Cr, TNF- α, and IL-6 were significantly increased, and the injury of pancreas and kidney was aggravated. The levels of NOX4, NOX2, ROS, p-Akt, GSK-3β, NF-κB, and TNF-α in the kidney were detected, suggesting that NOX may regulate the activity of downstream p-Akt and GSK-3β by regulating ROS levels, thereby affecting the release of inflammatory mediators and regulating HTGP-related kidney injury. After application of apocynin, the expression of NOX4 and NOX2 and the level of ROS in the kidney were reduced, the release of inflammatory mediators decreased, and the histopathology injury of pancreas and kidney was improved obviously.||||NOX may play an important role in HTGP-associated kidney injury through Akt/GSK-3β pathway. Apocynin can significantly downregulate the level of NOX and play a protective role in HTGP-related kidney injury through Akt/GSK-3β pathway.

Long non-coding RNA RP11-468E2.5 curtails colorectal cancer cell proliferation and stimulates apoptosis via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by targeting STAT5 and STAT6.||||||||Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are tumor-associated biological molecules and have been found to be implicated in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aims to examine the effects of lncRNA RP11-468E2.5 and its target genes (STAT5 and STAT6) on the biological activities of CRC cells via the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway.||||We initially screened the GEO database for differentially expressed lncRNAs related to CRC and then made a prediction of the implicated target genes. Then we collected CRC tissues and adjacent normal tissues from 169 CRC patients. Human CRC HCT116 and SW480 cells were treated with small interference RNA (siRNA) against RP11-468E2.5, AG490 (an inhibitor of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway), or both in combination. Next, we measured the effects of RP11-468E2.5 treatment on cellular activities such as cell viability, cycle distribution and cell apoptosis, and studied interactions among RP11-468E2.5, STAT5/STAT6, and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Finally, an in vivo tumor formation assay was performed to observe the effect of RP11-468E2.5 on tumor growth.||||The CRC-related gene microarray data showed low expression of RP11-468E2.5 in CRC surgical specimens. However, RP11-468E2.5 was confirmed to target STAT5 and STAT6, which participate in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. CRC tissues showed lower expression of RP11-468E2.5, higher expression of STAT5, STAT6 and of the cell cycle marker Cyclin D1 (CCND1), compared to the findings in adjacent normal tissues. The treatment of siRNA against RP11-468E2.5 increased expression of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5, STAT6, CCND1 and Bcl-2 along with the extent of STAT3, STAT5 and STAT6 phosphorylation, while lowering expression of P21 and P27. Treatment with AG490 exhibited approximately opposite effects, whereas siRNA against RP11-468E2.5 treatment stimulated CRC cell proliferation and reduced cell apoptosis, while promoting cell cycle entry; AG490 treatment reversed these results.||||Altogether, we conclude that up-regulation of RP11-468E2.5 inhibits the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by targeting STAT5 and STAT6, thereby suppressing cell proliferation and promoting cell apoptosis in CRC.

Repurposing Penfluridol in Combination with Temozolomide for the Treatment of Glioblastoma.||||||||Despite the presence of aggressive treatment strategies, glioblastoma remains intractable, warranting a novel therapeutic modality. An oral antipsychotic agent, penflurido (PFD), used for schizophrenia treatment, has shown an antitumor effect on various types of cancer cells. As glioma sphere-forming cells (GSCs) are known to mediate drug resistance in glioblastoma, and considering that antipsychotics can easily penetrate the blood-brain barrier, we investigated the antitumor effect of PFD on patient-derived GSCs. Using five GSCs, we found that PFD exerts an antiproliferative effect in a time- and dose-dependent manner. At IC50, spheroid size and second-generation spheroid formation were significantly suppressed. Stemness factors, SOX2 and OCT4, were decreased. PFD treatment reduced cancer cell migration and invasion by reducing the Integrin α6 and uPAR levels and suppression of the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) factors, vimentin and Zeb1. GLI1 was found to be involved in PFD-induced EMT inhibition. Furthermore, combinatorial treatment of PFD with temozolomide (TMZ) significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival in vivo. Immunostaining revealed decreased expression of GLI1, SOX2, and vimentin in the PFD treatment group but not in the TMZ-only treatment group. Therefore, PFD can be effectively repurposed for the treatment of glioblastoma by combining it with TMZ.

Epitope Mapping of Anti-Bear Podoplanin Monoclonal Antibody PMab-247.||||||||Podoplanin (PDPN)/T1alpha is a type I transmembrane sialoglycoprotein, which is expressed on podocytes of the kidneys and type I alveolar cells of the lungs. PDPN is also known as Aggrus, a platelet aggregation-inducing factor, which comprises three platelet aggregation-stimulating (PLAG) domains (PLAG1, PLAG2, and PLAG3) in the N-terminus and PLAG-like domains (PLDs) in the middle of the PDPN protein. We have previously established a mouse anti-bear PDPN (bPDPN) monoclonal antibody (mAb) clone, PMab-247 using the Cell-Based Immunization and Screening (CBIS) method. PMab-247 is very useful in flow cytometry, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses; however, the binding epitope of PMab-247 has not been elucidated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the epitope of PMab-247 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and IHC analyses. The results revealed that the critical epitopes of PMab-247 are Asp76, Arg78, Glu80, and Arg82 of bPDPN. The Glu80 and Arg82 are included in PLD of bPDPN. The findings of our study can be applied to the production of more functional anti-bPDPN mAbs.

Mismatch Repair Deficiency in Endometrial Cancer: Immunohistochemistry Staining and Clinical Implications.||||||||DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency is associated with increased risk of developing several types of cancer and is the most common cause of hereditary endometrial cancer. Identification of the microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype in endometrial carcinoma is important given that such tumors are frequent.||||The objective of this study was to assess the utility of immunohistochemistry (IHC), a simple and fast technique, in detecting MSI status in endometrial carcinoma and evaluate the correlation between the MSI phenotype and the various anatomo-clinical parameters.||||IHC expression of 4 markers (MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, and MSH6) was studied. For all IHC markers, a combined score based on the intensity of nuclear labeling and the percentage of labeled cells was defined to establish a score. Correlation between MSI phenotype and different clinicopathologic parameters was evaluated using statistical analysis (software STATA and the Fisher exact test).||||The mean age of the patients was 58.6 years. Positive staining was highly extended (score 3) with 79% to 100% of marked cells. Less than 10% of positive tumor cells were seen in 3% of cases for MSH6 and PMS2. Abnormal MMR IHC was detected in 10 cases (22.22%). Seven tumors showed loss of MLH1/PMS2. The loss of MSH2/MSH6 was observed in 1 case. The loss of MLH1 or PMS2 was seen only in 2 cases. The number of MSI positive status was 10 cases (22.7%). Correlation between clinicopathologic parameters showed MMR deficiency was significantly associated with low-grade tumor and localized stage. There was no positive correlation between age, histologic subtype, or myometrium invasion.||||In summary, detection of DNA MMR deficiencies by IHC can effectively diagnose the MSI phenotype in endometrial carcinoma. Correlation between clinicopathologic parameters showed MMR deficiency was significantly associated with low-grade tumor and localized stage.

NADPH oxidase 1 mediates caerulein-induced pancreatic fibrosis in chronic pancreatitis.||||||||Inflammatory disorders of the pancreas are divided into acute (AP) and chronic (CP) forms. Both states of pancreatitis are a result of pro-inflammatory mediators, including reactive oxygen species (ROS). One of the sources of ROS is NADPH oxidase (Nox). The rodent genome encodes Nox1-4, Duox1 and Duox2. Our purpose was to assess the extent to which Nox enzymes contribute to the pathogenesis of both AP and CP using Nox-deficient mice. Using RT-PCR, Nox1 was found in both isolated mouse pancreatic acini and pancreatic stellate cells (PaSCs). Subsequently, mice with genetically deleted Nox1 were further studied and showed that the histo-morphologic characteristics of caerulein-induced CP, but not caerulein-induced AP, was ameliorated in Nox1 KO mice. We also found that the lack of Nox1 impaired caerulein-induced ROS generation in PaSCs. Using Western blotting, we found that AKT mediates the fibrotic effect of Nox1 in a mouse model of CP. We also found a decrease in phospho-ERK and p38MAPK levels in Nox1 KO mice with CP, but not with AP. Both CP-induced TGF-β up-regulation and NF-ĸB activation were impaired in pancreas from Nox1 KO mice. Western blotting indicated increases in proteins involved in fibrosis and acinar-to-ductal metaplasia in WT mice with CP. No change in those proteins were observed in Nox1 KO mice. The lack of Nox1 lowered mRNA levels of CP-induced matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9 and E-cadherin repressor Twist in PaSCs. CONCLUSION: Nox1-derived ROS in PaSCs mediate the fibrotic process of CP by activating the downstream redox-sensitive signaling pathways AKT and NF-ĸB, up-regulating MMP-9 and Twist, and producing α-smooth muscle actin and collagen I and III.

PPAR γ agonist, pioglitazone, suppresses melanoma cancer in mice by inhibiting TLR4 signaling.|||||||| Although previous studies demonstrated an anticancer effect for the ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) through activation of its anti-inflammatory responses, nevertheless the anti-tumor mechanism of PPARγ has not been intensively investigated. One of the molecules involved in cancer progression is toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4).||||B16F10 melanoma cells were cultured with or without LPS for 24 hr. The cells were subcutaneously injected to two groups of C57BL/6 mice. After the development of palpable tumors each group of animals were divide to four sub-groups and received pioglitazone in different dose ranges (0,10,50,100 mg/kg/day) for 10 days. At the end of the study, the expression of Tlr4, Myd-88, Nf-kb1 genes was evaluated by qRT-PCR in different groups in mice tumor. The TLR-4 protein expression was evaluated by IHC. TNF-α level in mice tumor and serum were measured by ELISA kits. Tumor volume was measured with Vernier calipers.||||We observed that activation of PPARγ by its agonist, pioglitazone, reduces tumor volume, Tlr-4, Myd-88, Nf-kb1 mRNA expression, TLR4 protein expression and TNF-α production in melanoma tumor especially in groups that were injected with LPS -stimulated cells. Moreover, treatment of melanoma cells with pioglitazone showed that the inhibitory effects of pioglitazone on LPS-induced inflammatory responses were TLR4 dependent.||||The results indicate that pioglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, has a beneficial protective effect against melanoma via interfering with the TLR4-dependent signaling pathways.

Nitric oxide regulates the expression of heme carrier protein-1 via hypoxia inducible factor-1α stabilization.||||||||Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer therapy that capitalizes on cancer-specific porphyrin accumulation. We have investigated this phenomenon to propose the following three conclusions: 1) the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is closely related to both nitric oxide (NO) and heme carrier protein-1 (HCP-1), 2) NO inactivates ferrochelatase, and thus, the intracellular porphyrin levels in the cells are increased by the administration of an NO donor after 5-aminolevulinic acid treatment, 3) HCP-1 transports not only heme but also other porphyrins. Since NO stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, resulting in the upregulation of heme biosynthesis, HCP-1 expression can be increased by HIF-1α stabilization. In this study, we determined whether NO regulates HCP-1 expression by stabilizing HIF-1α expression. For this purpose, rat gastric cancer cell line RGK36 was treated with L-arginine or N6-(1-iminoethyl)-L-lysine (L-NIL). L-arginine treatment increased the intracellular NO concentration, and both HCP-1 and HIF-1α expression, while L-NIL treatment decreased them. Cytotoxicity of PDT was enhanced by L-arginine, following intracellular hemato-porphyrin dihydrochloride (HpD) accumulation. Both Cytotoxicity of PDT and HpD accumulation were decreased by L-NIL. The HCP-1 and HIF-1α expression, intracellular HpD accumulation and PDT cytotoxicity were decreased by 2-methoxyestradiol, which is a HIF-1α inhibitor. Moreover, these phenomena were not increased by a combination of both L-arginine and 2-Me. Thus, HCP-1 can be a downstream target of HIF-1α. These effects were also induced in the human gastric cancer cell line MKN45. Taken together, we conclude that HCP-1 expression is regulated by NO via HIF-1α stabilization.

Phosphorylated Heat Shock Protein 27 Inhibits Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammation in Thp1 Cells by Promoting TLR4 Endocytosis, Ubiquitination, and Degradation.||||||||The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of Hsp27 on LPS-induced inflammation and identify the precise mechanisms about how Hsp27 regulates LPS-induced TLR4 signaling in Thp1 cells. Thp1 cells were transfected with Flag-Hsp27 or pcDNA3.1, and then treated with LPS for indicated time. TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were determined by ELISA. The protein levels of Hsp27, p-Hsp27 (Ser15, Ser78, and Ser82), and TLR4 were measured by Western blotting. In vitro study showed that over-expression of Hsp27 downregulated the release of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and suppressed the activation of TLR4 signals after stimulated by LPS. The location of TLR4 and RAB5 was detected by confocal microscopy. Immunoprecipitation was used to determine the ubiquitination and degradation of TLR4 and interaction between Hsp27 and TLR4. Results showed that Hsp27 could promote TLR4 endocytosis and ubiquitination and degradation. Further research revealed that Hsp27 was phosphorylated after LPS, only phosphorylated Hsp27 can interact with TLR4 and inhibit the activation of TLR4 signaling, which was demonstrated by inhibition of Hsp27 phosphorylation with inhibitors or transfection of Hsp27 mutants into Thp1 cells. Phosphorylated Hsp27 reduced the release of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, and suppressed the activation of TLR4 signaling by promoting TLR4 endocytosis, ubiquitination, and degradation.

The immunofluorometric assay (IFMA) specific for aMMP-8 was used as the reference method.||||Fourteen saliva samples out of a total of 47 showed positivity for aMMP-8 PoC test. Both the TREM-1 and the aMMP-8 (IFMA) levels were significantly elevated among the aMMP-8 PoC test positives compared with the PoC test negatives (P < 0.05). Moreover, aMMP-8 levels assessed by IFMA showed a strong positive correlation with TREM-1 levels in saliva (r = 0.777, P < 0.001). The number of sites with a probing depth of ≥4 mm was significantly lower among the adolescents that had a negative aMMP-8 PoC test result, and TREM-1 levels < 75 pg/mL (P < 0.05).

TRPM6 N-Terminal CaM- and S100A1-Binding Domains.||||||||Transient receptor potential (TRPs) channels are crucial downstream targets of calcium signalling cascades. They can be modulated either by calcium itself and/or by calcium-binding proteins (CBPs). Intracellular messengers usually interact with binding domains present at the most variable TRP regions-N- and C-cytoplasmic termini. Calmodulin (CaM) is a calcium-dependent cytosolic protein serving as a modulator of most transmembrane receptors. Although CaM-binding domains are widespread within intracellular parts of TRPs, no such binding domain has been characterised at the TRP melastatin member-the transient receptor potential melastatin 6 (TRPM6) channel. Another CBP, the S100 calcium-binding protein A1 (S100A1), is also known for its modulatory activities towards receptors. S100A1 commonly shares a CaM-binding domain. Here, we present the first identified CaM and S100A1 binding sites at the N-terminal of TRPM6. We have confirmed the L520-R535 N-terminal TRPM6 domain as a shared binding site for CaM and S100A1 using biophysical and molecular modelling methods. A specific domain of basic amino acid residues (R526/R531/K532/R535) present at this TRPM6 domain has been identified as crucial to maintain non-covalent interactions with the ligands. Our data unambiguously confirm that CaM and S100A1 share the same binding domain at the TRPM6 N-terminus although the ligand-binding mechanism is different.

B7-H3 is a transmembrane protein expressed on the surface of tumor cells, antigen presenting cells, natural killer cells, tumor endothelial cells, but can also be present in intra- and extracellular vesicles. Additionally, B7-H3 may be present as circulating soluble isoforms in serum and other body fluids. B7-H3 is overexpressed in a variety of tumor types, in correlation with poor prognosis. B7-H3 is a promising new immunotherapy target for anti-cancer immune response, as well as being a potential biomarker. Besides its immunoregulatory role, B7-H3 has intrinsic pro-tumorigenic activities related to enhanced cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, metastatic capacity and anti-cancer drug resistance. B7-H3 has also been found to regulate key metabolic enzymes, promoting the high glycolytic capacity of cancer cells. B7-H3 receptors are still not identified, and little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying B7-H3 functions.

We identified 268 genes differentially expressed (DEGs) in Drosophila Kc cells treated with DM, including up-regulated 180 genes and down-regulated 88 genes compared with the control group (fold-change≥2, qValue≤0.001) by RNA-seq, they are mainly linked to metabolic process, stimulation response, immune system process. When the cells are treated with DM in the case of overexpression of the Keap1 gene, the cytochrome P450 family genes were significantly down-regulated, and some diseases-related genes and non-coding genes also changed. Our data shown that Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway may play an important role in DM stress, which will provide a new direction for studying the mechanism of insect resistance.

The Interaction between NKAP and HDAC3 Is Critical for T Cell Maturation.||||||||NKAP and HDAC3 are critical for T cell maturation. NKAP and HDAC3 physically associate, and a point mutation in NKAP, NKAP(Y352A), abrogates this interaction. To evaluate the significance of NKAP and HDAC3 association in T cell maturation, transgenic mice were engineered for cre-mediated endogenous NKAP gene deletion coupled to induction of NKAP(Y352A) or a wild type (WT) control transgene, NKAP(WT), in double positive thymocytes or regulatory T cells (Tregs). T cell maturation was normal in mice with endogenous NKAP deletion coupled to NKAP(WT) induction. However, severe defects occurred in T cell and Treg maturation and in iNKT cell development when NKAP(Y352A) was induced, recapitulating NKAP deficiency. Conventional T cells expressing NKAP(Y352A) failed to enter the long-term T cell pool, did not produce cytokines, and remained complement susceptible, whereas Tregs expressing NKAP(Y352A) were eliminated as recent thymic emigrants leading to lethal autoimmunity. Overall, these results demonstrate the significance of NKAP-HDAC3 association in T cells.

SBP2 deficiency in adipose tissue macrophages drives insulin resistance in obesity.||||||||Proinflammatory activation and accumulation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are associated with increased risk of insulin resistance in obesity. Here, we described the previously unidentified role of selenocysteine insertion sequence-binding protein 2 (SBP2) in maintaining insulin sensitivity in obesity. SBP2 was suppressed in ATMs of diet-induced obese mice and was correlated with adipose tissue inflammation. Loss of SBP2 initiated metabolic activation of ATMs, inducing intracellular reactive oxygen species content and inflammasome, which subsequently promoted IL-1β-associated local proliferation and infiltration of proinflammatory macrophages. ATM-specific knockdown of SBP2 in obese mice promoted insulin resistance by increasing fat tissue inflammation and expansion. Reexpression of SBP2 improved insulin sensitivity. Last, an herbal formula that specifically induced SBP2 expression in ATMs can experimentally improve insulin sensitivity. Clinical observation revealed that it improved hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes. This study identified SBP2 in ATMs as a potential target in rescuing insulin resistance in obesity.

The effects of extended nitric oxide release on responses of the human non-pregnant myometrium to endothelin-1 or vasopressin.||||||||Uterotonic mediators: endothelin-1 (ET-1), arginine vasopressin (AVP), and nitric oxide (NO) play important roles in the regulation of uterine contractility. We hypothesize that NO affects both ET-1 or AVP. Therefore, this study investigated the involvement of extended exogenous NO release in the regulation of responses of the human non-pregnant myometrium to ET-1 and AVP.||||-nitroarginine (L-NNA) was added to the organ bath.||||ET-1 enhanced the spontaneous contractile activity of the myometrium more powerfully (p < 0.01) than AVP. Preincubation with exogenous NO weakened ET-1- or AVP-induced increases in this contractile activity (p < 0.05). However, unexpected results were obtained after preincubation with L-NNA and with DETA/NO then added. Both ET-1 and AVP induced augmented contractile effects in almost all concentrations compared with the responses to these peptides alone or after NOS synthase inhibition (both p < 0.01).||||This study demonstrated for the first time that extended incubation with a NO donor influences the uterine muscle response evoked by ET-1 and AVP. Both endogenous and exogenous NO is involved in the control of the uterine responses to ET-1 or AVP of non-pregnant myometrium. Furthermore, both peptides stimulate increased uterine contractility when the local imbalance between the constrictive and relaxing mediators takes place.

Comparison between conventional and comprehensive sequencing approaches for genetic diagnosis of Alport syndrome.||||||||Alport syndrome (AS) is a hereditary disease caused by mutations in COL4A3-5 genes. Recently, comprehensive genetic analysis has become the first-line diagnostic tool for AS. However, no reports comparing mutation identification rates between conventional sequencing and comprehensive screening have been published.||||In this study, 441 patients clinically suspected of having AS were divided into two groups and compared. The initial mutational analysis method involved targeted exome sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) (n = 147, NGS group) or Sanger sequencing for COL4A3/COL4A4/COL4A5 (n = 294, Sanger group).||||In the NGS group, 126 patients (86%) were diagnosed with AS by NGS, while two had pathogenic mutations in other genes, NPHS1 and EYA1. Further, 239 patients (81%) were diagnosed with AS by initial analysis in the Sanger group. Thirteen patients who were negative for mutation detection in the Sanger group were analyzed by NGS; three were diagnosed with AS. Two had mutations in CLCN5 or LAMB2. The final variant detection rate was 90%.||||Our results reveal that Sanger sequencing and targeted exome sequencing have high diagnostic ability. NGS also has the advantage of detecting other inherited kidney diseases and pathogenic mutations missed by Sanger sequencing.

PPARγ and RhoBTB1 in hypertension.||||||||This review provides an up-to-date understanding of how peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) exerts its cardioprotective effect in the vasculature through its activation of novel PPARγ target genes in endothelium and vascular smooth muscle.||||In vascular endothelial cells, PPARγ plays a protective role by increasing nitric oxide bioavailability and preventing oxidative stress. RBP7 is a PPARγ target gene enriched in vascular endothelial cells, which is likely to form a positive feedback loop with PPARγ. In vascular smooth muscle cells, PPARγ antagonizes the renin-angiotensin system, maintains vascular integrity, suppresses vasoconstriction, and promotes vasodilation through distinct pathways. Rho-related BTB domain containing protein 1 (RhoBTB1) is a novel PPARγ gene target in vascular smooth muscle cells that mediates the protective effect of PPARγ by serving as a substrate adaptor between the Cullin-3 RING ubiquitin ligase and phosphodiesterase 5, thus restraining its activity through ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.||||In the vasculature, PPARγ exerts its cardioprotective effect through its transcriptional activity in endothelium and vascular smooth muscle. From the understanding of PPARγ's transcription targets in those pathways, novel hypertension therapy target(s) will emerge.

Multiomics Prediction of Response Rates to Therapies to Inhibit Programmed Cell Death 1 and Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 1.||||||||Therapies to inhibit programmed cell death 1 and its ligand (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) provide significant survival benefits in many cancers, but the efficacy of these treatments varies considerably across different cancer types. Identifying the underlying variables associated with this cancer type-specific response remains an important open research challenge.||||To evaluate systematically a multitude of neoantigen-, checkpoint-, and immune response-related variables to determine the key variables that accurately predict the response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy across different cancer types.||||This analysis of a broad range of data used whole-exome and RNA sequencing of 7187 patients from the publicly available Cancer Genome Atlas and the objective response rate (ORR) data of 21 cancer types obtained from a collection of clinical trials. Thirty-six variables of 3 distinct classes considered were associated with (1) tumor neoantigens, (2) tumor microenvironment and inflammation, and (3) the checkpoint targets. The performance of each class of variables and their combinations in predicting the ORR to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy was evaluated. Accuracy of predictions was quantified with Spearman correlation measured using a standard leave-one-out cross-validation, a statistical method of evaluating a statistical model by dividing data into 2 segments: one to train the model and the other to validate the model. Data were collected from October 19 through 31, 2018, and were analyzed from November 1 through December 14, 2018.||||Response to anti-PD-1/PD-1 therapy.||||Among the 36 variables, estimated CD8+ T-cell abundance was the most predictive of the response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy across cancer types (Spearman R = 0.72; P < 2.3 × 10-4), followed by the tumor mutational burden (Spearman R = 0.68; P < 6.2 × 10-4), and the fraction of samples with high PD1 gene expression (Spearman R = 0.68; P < 6.9 × 10-4). Notably these top 3 variables cover the 3 classes considered, and their combination is highly correlated with response (Spearman R = 0.90; P < 4.1 × 10-8), explaining more than 80% of the ORR variance observed across different tumor types.||||That we know of, this is the first systematic evaluation of the different variables associated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy response across different tumor types. The findings suggest that the 3 key variables can explain most of the observed cross-cancer response variability, but their relative explanatory roles may vary in specific cancer types.

There were two major groups of ICRs based on agro-morphological clustering. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers identified allelic variants with an average of 2.48 alleles per locus and the gene diversity (GD) ranged from 0.02 to 0.62 at different loci. ICR lines showed a genetic structure involving two sub-populations, POP1 and POP2. Both the subpopulations had the presence of admixture lines. Nearest ancestry-based grouping of ICRs by neighbour-joining (NJ) method showed near similar grouping as that of sub-population division. The POP2 was the largest group but with fewer admixed lines. POP1 was more distinct than POP2. Since the hybrid parents of the ICRs had limited diversity on maternal lineage, paternal lineage was concluded as the major contributor to the observed divergence and population differentiation. ICRs developed from certain hybrids were more genetically distinct than other hybrids. Even with the moderate variability, ICRs could be considered as a potential source of fertility restoration in hybrid development because of their distinct population structure and the full complement of restorer genes they contained. ICR lines with high per se performance can be utilized in hybrid rice development by estimating their combining ability.

Five cases of complete HM, diploid with 2 paternal genome sets (CHM;PP), 5 cases of partial HM, triploid with 2 paternal and 1 maternal genome sets (PHM;PPM), and 5 cases of non-HM, with diploid biparental genomes (non-HM;PM) were stained with p57 Abs: 57P06, EP183, KP10, and KP39. Assessment of the fraction of nuclei stained, and the intensity of staining of the nuclei and cytoplasm was performed. For evaluation of the Abs, the observations in cytotrophoblasts, villous stromal cells, maternal decidual cells, and intermediate trophoblasts were scored. The fraction of stained nuclei in cytotrophoblasts and villous stromal cells and the staining of cytoplasm showed to be important parameters in the evaluation of the Abs. 57P06 was evaluated as optimal. KP10 showed moderate cytoplasmatic staining in maternal decidual cells and intermediate trophoblasts, and was evaluated as good. EP183 was evaluated as poor, primarily due to nuclear staining in ≥10% of the villous stromal cells in CHM;PP. KP39 was evaluated as poor, primarily due to strong cytoplasmatic staining in some cytotrophoblasts and villous stromal cells. A structured testing of p57 for diagnosing HM is recommended. No nuclear staining was observed in syncytiotrophoblasts of CHM;PP, indicating that in syncytiotrophoblasts also, CDKN1C is paternally imprinted.

Circular RNA screening from EIF3a in lung cancer.||||||||Eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (EIF3) is one of the largest and most complex translation initiation factors, which consists of 13 subunits named eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit A (EIF3a) to EIF3m. EIF3a is the largest subunit of EIF3. Previous studies suggested that EIF3a is a housekeeping gene, recent results have found that EIF3a is closely related to the tumorigenesis and drug resistance. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) derived from biologically important gene can play an important role in gene regulation. However, the mechanism underlying circRNAs' biological functions is not well understood yet. In this work, we screened 31 EIF3a-derived circRNAs, in which two circEIF3as were identified to be correlated with cisplatin drug sensitivity in lung cancer. Two circEIF3as were found involved in RNA-binding proteins-mediated biological processes and may be related to translational regulation according to bioinformatics analyses. CircEIF3as, the transcriptional initiation factor EIF3a transcribed circRNAs, are associated with both drug sensitivity and translation regulation. These findings mean that they may have a functional synergy effect with EIF3a or be valuable therapeutic targets for treatment like EIF3a. This is the first study that exploits circRNAs screening from EIF3a in lung cancer, our findings provide a novel perspective on the function of EIF3a and circEIF3as in lung cancer.

Tau tubulin kinases in proteinopathy.||||||||A number of neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by deposition of abnormally phosphorylated tau or TDP-43 in disease-affected neurons. These diseases include Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. No disease-modifying therapeutics is available to treat these disorders, and we have a limited understanding of the cellular and molecular factors integral to disease initiation or progression. Phosphorylated tau and TDP-43 are important markers of pathology in dementia disorders and directly contribute to tau- and TDP-43-related neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. Here, we review the scope of tau and TDP-43 phosphorylation in neurodegenerative disease and discuss recent work demonstrating the kinases TTBK1 and TTBK2 phosphorylate both tau and TDP-43, promoting neurodegeneration.

LYAR potentiates rRNA synthesis by recruiting BRD2/4 and the MYST-type acetyltransferase KAT7 to rDNA.||||||||Activation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis is pivotal during cell growth and proliferation, but its aberrant upregulation may promote tumorigenesis. Here, we demonstrate that the candidate oncoprotein, LYAR, enhances ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription. Our data reveal that LYAR binds the histone-associated protein BRD2 without involvement of acetyl-lysine-binding bromodomains and recruits BRD2 to the rDNA promoter and transcribed regions via association with upstream binding factor. We show that BRD2 is required for the recruitment of the MYST-type acetyltransferase KAT7 to rDNA loci, resulting in enhanced local acetylation of histone H4. In addition, LYAR binds a complex of BRD4 and KAT7, which is then recruited to rDNA independently of the BRD2-KAT7 complex to accelerate the local acetylation of both H4 and H3. BRD2 also helps recruit BRD4 to rDNA. By contrast, LYAR has no effect on rDNA methylation or the binding of RNA polymerase I subunits to rDNA. These data suggest that LYAR promotes the association of the BRD2-KAT7 and BRD4-KAT7 complexes with transcription-competent rDNA loci but not to transcriptionally silent rDNA loci, thereby increasing rRNA synthesis by altering the local acetylation status of histone H3 and H4.

Insulin and adipokine signaling and their cross-regulation in postmortem human brain.||||||||Aberrant insulin and adipokine signaling has been implicated in cognitive decline associated with both type 2 diabetes mellitus and neurodegenerative diseases. We established methods that reliably measure insulin, adiponectin and leptin signaling, and their crosstalk, in thawed postmortem mid-frontal cortical tissue from cognitively normal older subjects with a short postmortem interval. Insulin-evoked insulin receptor (IR) activation increases activated, tyrosine-phosphorylated IRβ on tyrosine residues 960, 1150, and 1151, insulin receptor substrate-1 recruitment to IRβ and phosphorylated RAC-α-serine/threonine-protein kinase. Adiponectin augments, but leptin inhibits, insulin signaling. Adiponectin activates adiponectin receptors to induce APPL1 binding to adiponectin receptor 1 and 2 and T-cadherin and downstream adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation. Insulin inhibited adiponectin-induced signaling. In addition, leptin-induced leptin receptor (OB-R) signaling promotes Janus kinase 2 recruitment to OB-R and Janus kinase 2 and downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation. Insulin enhanced leptin signaling. These data demonstrate insulin and adipokine signaling interactions in human brain. Future studies can use these methods to examine insulin, adiponectin, and leptin metabolic dysregulation in aging and disease states, such as type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias.

The current study assessed the differential effect of TSPs on protein expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).

Statistical analysis was performed by t-test and p< 0.05 was considered significant. All TSPs increased their own expression. TSP-1 and TSP-2 increased production of ANGPTL-4 and PDGF-BB. TSP-1 increased exclusively TGF-BETA1 and CD44 production. TSP-2 increased TSP-1 expression. All TSPs decreased IL-8. The findings suggest that TSP-1 and TSP-2 may promote vascular remodeling, in part, by increasing ANGPTL-4, PDGF-BB and their own expression. TSP-5 did not upregulate the inflammatory mediators TSP-1, PDGF-BB or TGF-BETA1, but upregulated its own expression, which could be a protective mechanism against the response to vascular injury.
