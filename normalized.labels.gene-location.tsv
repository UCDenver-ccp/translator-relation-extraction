Effectiveness of 1, 2, AND 3 Human Papillomavirus Vaccine doses against HPV-16/18 positive High-grade Cervical Lesions.||||||||Before 2016, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination was recommended in a three-dose schedule; however, many vaccine-eligible U.S. females received <3 doses, providing an opportunity to evaluate real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 1, 2, and 3 doses. We analyzed data on cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2-3 and adenocarcinoma in situ (CIN2+) from the HPV Vaccine Impact Monitoring Project (HPV-IMPACT), 2008-2014. Archived tissue from CIN2+ lesions was tested for 37 HPV types. Women were classified by number of doses received ≥24 months before CIN2+ detection. Using a test-negative design, VE was estimated as 1-adjusted odds ratio from a logistic regression model that compared vaccination history for women whose lesions tested positive for HPV-16/18 (vaccine-type cases) with all other CIN2+ (controls). Among 3,300 women with CIN2+, typing results, and vaccine history available, 1,561 (47%) were HPV-16/18 positive, 136 received (4%) 1 dose, 108 (3%) 2 doses, and 325 (10%) 3 doses. Adjusted odds ratios for vaccination with 1, 2, and 3 doses were 0.53 (95% confidence interval: 0.37, 0.76; VE=47%), 0.45 (95% confidence interval: 0.30, 0.69; VE=55%), and 0.26 (95% confidence interval 0.20, 0.35; VE=74%). We found significant VE against vaccine-type CIN2+ after 3 doses of HPV vaccine and lower but significant VE with 1 or 2 doses.

Long Non-Coding RNA (LncRNA) UFC1/miR-34a Contributes to Proliferation and Migration in Breast Cancer.||||||||BACKGROUND At present, a number of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been realized as the critical regulators of breast cancers. Current evidence indicates that dysregulation of UFC1 contributes to the tumorigenesis and progression of various types of human cancer. However, the roles of UFC1 in breast cancer are still unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS Firstly, we measured the expression of UFC1 in breast cancer tissues and cells lines compared with corresponding controls. Then, cell functional assays were performed to determine the roles of UFC1 in breast cancer progression in vitro. Moreover, the correlation between UFC1 and miR-34a was determined by luciferase reporter assays. Further, the role of miR-34a in regulating biological function of breast cancer and its downstream target CXCL10 was applied by a series of functional assays. RESULTS In present study, we found that UFC1 was highly expressed in breast tissue and cells lines compared with normal tissues and cell lines. Silenced UFC1 suppressed multiple biological activities of breast cancer cells, which also functioned as a miR-34a sponge in breast cancer. Furthermore, over-expressing miR-34a could prominently suppress cell growth, invasion, migration and inducing apoptosis in breast cancer cells. In addition, we verified that miR-34a was a target of CXCL10 by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay. CONCLUSIONS LncRNA UFC1 regulated biological activity of breast cancer via miR-34a/CXCL10 axis, providing a novel diagnosis biomarker and potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.

Roles of HIFs and VEGF in angiogenesis in the retina and brain.||||||||Vascular development in the mammalian retina is a paradigm for CNS vascular development in general, and its study is revealing fundamental mechanisms that explain the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapies in retinal vascular disease. During development of the mammalian retina, hypoxic astrocytes are hypothesized to secrete VEGF, which attracts growing endothelial cells as they migrate radially from the optic disc. However, published tests of this model using astrocyte-specific deletion of Vegf in the developing mouse retina appear to contradict this theory. Here, we report that selectively eliminating Vegf in neonatal retinal astrocytes with a Gfap-Cre line that recombines with approximately 100% efficiency had no effect on proliferation or radial migration of astrocytes, but completely blocked radial migration of endothelial cells, strongly supporting the hypoxic astrocyte model. Using additional Cre driver lines, we found evidence for essential and partially redundant actions of retina-derived (paracrine) and astrocyte-derived (autocrine) VEGF in controlling astrocyte proliferation and migration. We also extended previous studies by showing that HIF-1α in retinal neurons and HIF-2α in Müller glia play distinct roles in retinal vascular development and disease, adding to a growing body of data that point to the specialization of these 2 hypoxia-sensing transcription factors.

Androgen receptor in breast cancer: A wolf in sheep's clothing? A lesson from prostate cancer.||||||||The possibility that a receptor for androgen is expressed in Breast Cancer (BC) is fascinating given that the tumor is predominantly estrogen-dependent. The androgen receptor (AR) is emerging as a new marker and a potential new therapeutic target in the treatment of BC patients. The recent availability of selective AR inhibitors (e.g. bicalutamide, enzalutamide, apalutamide) approved for the treatment of prostate cancer has opened up the possibility to use them in BC patients whose tumors express AR. However, AR appears to have various functions according to the BC subtype, e.g. ER-positive or triple negative BC and the patient prognosis is different on the basis of the presence or absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors. Moreover, a different AR expression was seen according to the various ethnicities. Of note, in population at low economical income, the availability of anti-AR compounds at low cost could open the possibility to treat AR-positive triple negative BC that are highly present in these populations. Up to now, AR detection is not routinely performed in BC. The standardization of AR detection methods could render AR an easily detectable marker in primary BC and metastatic samples. Nevertheless, the overall concordance of 60% of AR expression in primary tumor and metastasis implies that a clinician who need the AR value to give anti-AR therapy should have the data on both the tumor materials. Following the comprehensive studies on prostate cancer the possibility to test AR on liquid biopsies suggest the use of this biomarker for a real-time disease monitoring. Finally, considering the possibility to treat patients with immune checkpoint inhibitors there is the need to know the relation between microenvironment and AR in BC.

P-Coumaric acid alleviates experimental diabetic nephropathy through modulation of Toll like receptor-4 in rats.||||||||Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is responsible for the occurrence of 30-47% of the incident cases of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide. DN is a chronic inflammatory disorder, which results from hyperglycemia-induced alterations and leads to renal fibrosis and ESRD. Toll like receptor-4 (TLR-4) participates in regulation of inflammatory response through controlling of innate immune system. P-Coumaric Acid (P-CA) is a natural hydroxycinnamic acid derivative and is widely present in vegetables, fruits, mushrooms and cereals. This study aimed to explore the renoprotective effect of P-CA, as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant natural compound, against experimental DN.||||DN was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (45 mg/kg) in rats. In kidney homogenate, levels of TLR-4, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) were measured using ELISA technique. Also, kidney collagen content was determined colorimetrically.||||Oral administration of P-CA (100 mg/kg) for 8 weeks significantly alleviated the DN. P-CA significantly reduced serum concentrations of glucose, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and reduced protein content in urine. Also, P-CA significantly increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and significantly reduced kidney contents of malondialdehyde (MDA), TLR-4, IL-6, TGFβ1 and collagen when compared with DN group. Moreover, P-CA significantly improved DN-induced histopathological abnormalities.||||P-CA confers protection against the progression of DN. This renoprotective effect can be attributed to its ability to decrease the generation of inflammatory and fibrotic cytokines in addition to restoring oxidant/antioxidant balance through its ability to down-regulate TLR-4 activation.

Characteristic response of striatal astrocytes to dopamine depletion.||||||||Astrocytes and astrocyte-related proteins play important roles in maintaining normal brain function, and also regulate pathological processes in brain diseases and injury. However, the role of astrocytes in the dopamine-depleted striatum remains unclear. A rat model of Parkinson's disease was therefore established by injecting 10 μL 6-hydroxydopamine (2.5 μg/μL) into the right medial forebrain bundle. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the immunoreactivity of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), calcium-binding protein B (S100B), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in the striatum, and to investigate the co-expression of GFAP with S100B and STAT3. Western blot assay was used to measure the protein expression of GFAP, S100B, and STAT3 in the striatum. Results demonstrated that striatal GFAP-immunoreactive cells had an astrocytic appearance under normal conditions, but that dopamine depletion induced a reactive phenotype with obvious morphological changes. The normal striatum also contained S100B and STAT3 expression. S100B-immunoreactive cells were uniform in the striatum, with round bodies and sparse, thin processes. STAT3-immunoreactive cells presented round cell bodies with sparse processes, or were darkly stained with a large cell body. Dopamine deprivation induced by 6-hydroxydopamine significantly enhanced the immunohistochemical positive reaction of S100B and STAT3. Normal striatal astrocytes expressed both S100B and STAT3. Striatal dopamine deprivation increased the number of GFAP/S100B and GFAP/STAT3 double-labeled cells, and increased the protein levels of GFAP, S100B, and STAT3. The present results suggest that morphological changes in astrocytes and changes in expression levels of astrocyte-related proteins are involved in the pathological process of striatal dopamine depletion. The study was approved by Animal Care and Use Committee of Sun Yat-sen University, China (Zhongshan Medical Ethics 2014 No. 23) on September 22, 2014.

Myc/Max dependent intronic long antisense noncoding RNA, EVA1A-AS, suppresses the expression of Myc/Max dependent anti-proliferating gene EVA1A in a U2 dependent manner.||||||||The Myc gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of most types of human cancerous tumors. Myc/Max activates large numbers of pro-tumor genes; however it also induces anti-proliferation genes. When anti-proliferation genes are activated by Myc, cancer cells can only survive if they are downregulated. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specific intronic long noncoding antisense (lnc-AS) RNA, the EVA1A-AS gene, is located within the second intron (I2) of the EVA1A gene (EVA-1 homolog A) that encodes an anti-proliferation factor. Indeed, EVA1A, but not EVA1A-AS, is expressed in normal liver. Depletion of EVA1A-AS suppressed cell proliferation of HepG2 cells by upregulation of EVA1A. Overexpression of EVA1A caused cell death at the G2/M phase via microtubule catastrophe. Furthermore, suppressed EVA1A expression levels are negatively correlated with differentiation grade in 365 primary HCCs, while EVA1A-AS expression levels are positively correlated with patient survival. Notably, both EVA1A and EVA1A-AS were activated by the Myc/Max complex. Eva1A-AS is transcribed in the opposite direction near the 3'splice site of EVA1A I2. The second intron did not splice out in a U2 dependent manner and EVA1A mRNA is not exported. Thus, the Myc/Max dependent anti-proliferating gene, EVA1A, is controlled by Myc/Max dependent anti-sense noncoding RNA for HCC survival.

Protective effects of vortioxetine in predator scent stress model of post-traumatic stress disorder in rats: role on neuroplasticity and apoptosis.||||||||Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be observed after a traumatic event. The effect of an antidepressant vortioxetine (Vrx) against PTSD is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible protective effect of Vrx in the predator scent-induced PTSD rat model. The rats were exposed to dirty cat litter for 10 min and the protocol was repeated 1 week later with clean cat litter as a trauma reminder. The rats received Vrx (10 mg/kg/p.o.) or saline (1 ml/kg/p.o.) during 7 days between two exposure sessions. Novel object recognition test, hole board test, and elevated plus maze were performed. The b-cell lymphoma (bcl-2)/bcl-2-associated X protein (bax) ratio, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), caspase-3 and -9 expressions were detected using Western blotting in the amygdaloid complex, hippocampus, and frontal cortex. Our results indicate that increased freezing time and anxiety index in the stress-induced group is decreased with Vrx application. Vrx treatment improved deteriorated recognition memory in the stress-induced group. Decreased bcl-2/bax ratio and BDNF level and increased caspase-3 and -9 expressions in the stress group, improved with Vrx in the amygdala, and hippocampus. Decreased bcl-2/bax ratio and increased casp-3 and -9 expressions in the stress group are ameliorated with Vrx in frontal cortex. The level of BDNF was increased with Vrx in the frontal cortex. Increased damage scores in the amygdaloid complex, hippocampal CA3, and frontal cortex in the stress group ameliorated with Vrx treatment. Our results show that if vortioxetine is administered immediately after trauma, it reduces anxiety, cognitive and neuronal impairment and may be protective against the development of PTSD.

Leptin promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration and invasion in epithelial breast cells, leading to tumor progression. Although, the molecular mechanisms that underlie these events are not fully understood, the activation of different signaling pathways appears to be essential. In this sense, the effects of leptin on the activation of kinases like Src and FAK, which regulate signaling pathways that activate the EMT program, are not completely described. Therefore, we investigated the involvement of these kinases using an in vitro model for leptin-induced EMT process in the non-tumorigenic MCF10A cell line. To this end, MCF10A cells were stimulated with leptin, and Src and FAK activation was assessed. Specific events occurring during EMT were also evaluated in the presence or absence of the kinases' chemical inhibitors PP2 and PF-573228. For instance, we tested the expression and subcellular localization of the EMT-related transcription factors Twist and β-catenin, by western blot and immunofluorescence. We also evaluated the secretion and activation of matrix metalloproteases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) by gelatin zymography. Invasiveness properties of leptin-stimulated cells were determined by invadopodia formation assays, and by the Transwell chamber method. Our results showed that leptin promotes EMT through Src and FAK activation, which leads to the secretion and activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9, invadopodia formation and cell invasion in MCF10A cells. In conclusion, our data suggest that leptin promotes an increase in the expression levels of Twist and β-catenin, the secretion of MMP-2, MMP-9, the invadopodia formation and invasion in MCF10A cells in a Src and FAK-dependent manner.

PMID:31394426	SMAD3	PR:000000365	[[15..20]]	muscle	UBERON:0002385	[[56..62]]	null	63	Y	Smad3 mRNA and SMAD3 protein are increased in the mouse muscle.	Transforming growth factor beta 1 signaling is altered in the spinal cord and muscle of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mice and patients.||||||||Gender differences characterize amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Because ALS patients have increased circulating levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1), here we analyzed gender and disease progression-related modification of TGFB1 and its related signaling molecules in the spinal cord and skeletal muscle of ALS mice and in muscle biopsies from sporadic ALS patients. At presymptomatic stage, Tgfb1 mRNA expression is reduced in the mouse spinal cord but is increased selectively in the male skeletal muscle. At symptomatic stage, it is induced both in the mouse spinal cord and muscle, as well as in the muscle of ALS patients. Tgfbr2 levels are induced only in the mouse spinal cord. Smad2 and Smad4 mRNAs are decreased in the mouse spinal cord and muscle, but SMAD2 protein levels are augmented selectively in the male mouse muscle. Smad3 mRNA and SMAD3 protein are increased in the mouse muscle. The expression of genes controlled by TGFB1 in the muscle (Pax7, Collagen1a1, and Fibronectin) are reduced both in male and female ALS mice at symptomatic stage. Thus, TGFB1 modulation may serve as a novel therapeutic target for ALS.

Fn14 overcomes cisplatin resistance of high-grade serous ovarian cancer by promoting Mdm2-mediated p53-R248Q ubiquitination and degradation.||||||||High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most lethal of all gynecological malignancies. Patients often suffer from chemoresistance. Several studies have reported that Fn14 could regulate migration, invasion, and angiogenesis in cancer cells. However, its functional role in chemoresistance of HGSOC is still unknown.||||The expression of Fn14 in tissue specimens was detected by IHC. CCK-8 assay was performed to determine changes in cell viability. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. The potential molecular mechanism of Fn14-regulated cisplatin resistance in HGSOC was investigated using qRT-PCR, western blotting, and Co-IP assays. The role of Fn14 in HGSOC was also investigated in a xenograft mouse model.||||In this study, we found that Fn14 was significantly downregulated in patients with cisplatin resistance. Patients with low Fn14 expression were associated with shorter progression-free survival and overall survival. Overexpression of Fn14 suppressed cisplatin resistance in OVCAR-3 cells, whereas knockdown of Fn14 did not affect cisplatin resistance in SKOV-3 cells. Interestingly, Fn14 could exert anti-chemoresistance effect only in OVCAR-3 cells harboring a p53-R248Q mutation, but not in SKOV-3 cells with a p53-null mutation. We isolated and identified primary cells from two patients with the p53-R248Q mutation from HGSOC patients and the anti-chemoresistance effect of Fn14 was observed in both primary cells. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that overexpression of Fn14 could reduce the formation of a Mdm2-p53-R248Q-Hsp90 complex by downregulating Hsp90 expression, indicating that degradation of p53-R248Q was accelerated via Mdm2-mediated ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway.||||Our findings demonstrate for the first time that Fn14 overcomes cisplatin resistance through modulation of the degradation of p53-R248Q and restoration of Fn14 expression might be a novel strategy for the treatment of HGSOC.

Effects of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation on skeletal muscle in healthy and cirrhotic rats.||||||||Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a leucine metabolite with protein anabolic effects. We examined the effects of an HMB-enriched diet in healthy rats and rats with liver cirrhosis induced by multiple doses of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). HMB increased branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs; valine, leucine and isoleucine) in blood and BCAA and ATP in muscles of healthy animals. The effect on muscle mass and protein content was insignificant. In CCl4-treated animals alterations characteristic of liver cirrhosis were found with decreased ratio of the BCAA to aromatic amino acids in blood and lower muscle mass and ATP content when compared with controls. In CCl4-treated animals consuming HMB, we observed higher mortality, lower body weight, higher BCAA levels in blood plasma, higher ATP content in muscles, and lower ATP content and higher cathepsin B and L activities in the liver when compared with CCl4-treated animals without HMB. We conclude that (1) HMB supplementation has a positive effect on muscle mitochondrial function and enhances BCAA concentrations in healthy animals and (2) the effects of HMB on the course of liver cirrhosis in CCl4-treated rats are detrimental. Further studies examining the effects of HMB in other models of hepatic injury are needed to determine pros and cons of HMB in the treatment of subjects with liver cirrhosis.

A Giant Parathyroid Tumor during Pregnancy: Adenoma versus Carcinoma.||||||||Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP) is one of the most common endocrine diseases. However, it is rare during pregnancy. 85% cases of the PHP are due to parathyroid adenoma (PA) and less than 1% because of parathyroid carcinoma (PC). Here we report a case of giant parathyroid adenoma (GPA) in a patient with first trimester pregnancy. Her calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were very high. The tumor measured 5 cm in greatest dimension, weighed 37 grams, and was adherent to the surrounding tissues. Grossly, the tumor was encapsulated and composed of solid and cystic components. Cut surface was reddish brown and soft. Microscopically, the tumor had a thick irregular capsule with entrapped parathyroid cells and extensive foreign body type reactions. The tumor was composed of multiple cell types with areas of pleomorphism. The mitotic index was nonetheless low. Even though the tumor was large and adherent with the surrounding strap muscles, the gross appearance and the histological morphology favored benign parathyroid adenoma. In this paper, we have discussed some important differential aspects of GPA, PA, and PC.

Decoding the link between WWOX and p53 in aggressive breast cancer.||||||||Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are aggressive forms of human breast cancer with poor prognosis and limited treatment response. Molecular understanding of BLBC and TNBC biology is instrumental to improve detection and management of these deadly diseases. Tumor suppressors WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) and TP53 are altered in BLBC and in TNBC. Nevertheless, the functional interplay between WWOX and p53 is poorly understood. In a recent study by Abdeen and colleagues, it has been demonstrated that WWOX loss drives BLBC formation via deregulating p53 functions. In this review, we highlight important signaling pathways regulated by WWOX and p53 that are related to estrogen receptor signaling, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and genomic instability and how they impact BLBC and TNBC development.

Coix seed oil ameliorates cancer cachexia by counteracting muscle loss and fat lipolysis.||||||||Cancer cachexia is a cancer-induced multifactorial debilitating syndrome directly accounting for 20% of cancer deaths without effective therapeutic approaches. It is extremely urgent to explore effective anti-cachexia drugs to ameliorate muscle and fat loss in cachexia patients.||||Lewis lung carcinoma bearing C57BL/6 mice were applied as the animal model to examine the therapeutic effect of Coix seed oil (CSO) on cancer cachexia. The food intake and body weight change were monitored every 3 days throughout the experiment. The IL-6 and TNF-α levels in serum were detected by ELISA assay. Several key proteins involved in muscle wasting and fat lipolysis were tested by Western blot to identify the potential mechanism of CSO.||||Administration of CSO through gavage significantly prevented body weight loss and ameliorated systemic inflammation without affecting food intake and tumor size. The weight and histological morphology of gastrocnemius muscle and epididymal adipose tissue in CSO-treated mice were also improved. In mechanism, we found that CSO decreased the expression of MuRF1 and the ratio of phospho-p65 (Ser536) to p65 in muscle tissue. Meanwhile, cancer-induced activation of HSL and AMPK was also inhibited by CSO administration.||||Coix seed oil exerts an anti-cachexia pharmaceutical effect by counteracting muscle and adipose tissue loss most likely through regulating NF-κB-MuRF1 and AMPK-HSL pathway.

Syndromic immune disorder caused by a viable hypomorphic allele of spliceosome component Snrnp40.||||||||We report a new immunodeficiency disorder in mice caused by a viable hypomorphic mutation of Snrnp40, an essential gene encoding a subunit of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex of the spliceosome. Snrnp40 is ubiquitous but strongly expressed in lymphoid tissue. Homozygous mutant mice showed hypersusceptibility to infection by murine cytomegalovirus and multiple defects of lymphoid development, stability and function. Cell-intrinsic defects of hematopoietic stem cell differentiation also affected homozygous mutants. SNRNP40 deficiency in primary hematopoietic stem cells or T cells or the EL4 cell line increased the frequency of splicing errors, mostly intron retention, in several hundred messenger RNAs. Altered expression of proteins associated with immune cell function was also observed in Snrnp40-mutant cells. The immunological consequences of SNRNP40 deficiency presumably result from cumulative, moderate effects on processing of many different mRNA molecules and secondary reductions in the expression of critical immune proteins, yielding a syndromic immune disorder.

Inhibition of EZH2 ameliorates cartilage endplate degeneration and attenuates the progression of intervertebral disc degeneration via demethylation of Sox-9.||||||||Cartilaginous endplate (CEP) degeneration is considered as one of the major causes of intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) which causes low back pain. Recent studies have proved that epigenetic alteration is involved in a variety of diseases. This work explored the role of histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) in CEP degeneration, as well as its underlying epigenetic mechanisms, and confirmed the effect of EZH2 knockdown on delaying IVDD development.||||Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and ChIP assay were applied to demonstrate the molecular mechanism of EZH2 in CEP tissue. The therapeutic potential of EZH2 was investigated using puncture-induced rat models.||||The EZH2 expression was upregulated in human and rat CEP tissue. It was also found that the overexpression of EZH2 suppressed the expression of Collagen II, aggrecan and Sox-9, and promoted the expression of ADTAMTS5 and MMP13 in rat endplate chondrocytes (EPCs), which could be reversed by EZH2 silencing. The correlation between EZH2 and Sox-9 was further explored, while overexpression of Sox-9 could reverse the effect of EZH2 in rat EPCs. Moreover, inhibition of EZH2 upregulated the level of Sox-9 by demethylating H3K27me3 at Sox-9 promoter sites, revealing the regulatory mechanism of EZH2 on Sox-9. Meanwhile, puncture-induced rat models showed that EZH2 knockdown exerted a protective effect on CEP and disc degeneration.||||This study reveals that EZH2 inhibition is a promising strategy for mitigating the symptoms and progression of IVDD.||||This study was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (Y16H060034).

However, the role of miR-34a/SIRT1 in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammatory pain remains unclear. In the present study, we examined miR-34a and SIRT1 in CFA mice. MiR-34a levels increased, while SIRT1 decreased in the spinal cord. Inhibiting miR-34a by intrathecal injection of miR-34a antagomir attenuated CFA-induced pain behavior. Moreover, miR-34a antagomir inhibited the CFA-induced SIRT1 decrease in the spinal cord. Furthermore, the analgesic effect of miR-34a antagomir was abrogated by the SIRT1 inhibitor EX-527. Our data provide support that the underlying mechanisms of miR-34a in promoting inflammatory pain may involve negative regulation of SIRT1.

Programmed Cell Death 1 and Programmed Cell Death Ligands in Extranodal Natural Killer/T Cell Lymphoma: Expression Pattern and Potential Prognostic Relevance.||||||||The programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death ligands (PD-1/PD-Ls) axis is a potential immune escape mechanism of cancers. However, data on the PD-1/PD-Ls pathway in EBV-associated extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL) and its clinical implication are limited. Herein, we characterized PD-1/PD-L expression and its prognosis relevance in 49 ENKTL patients in Thailand. PD-L1 was expressed frequently on both lymphoma cells (61.2%) and stroma (77.5%), whereas PD-L2 expression was more common on lymphoma (63.2%) than stromal cells. PD-1 was positive in 20.5% of stroma, but undetectable on lymphoma cells. There was no association between baseline clinical characteristics and the expression PD-1/PD-Ls. The survival of patients with PD-Ls on tumor cells was poor. For PD-L1-positive versus negative cases, the 2-year event-free survival (EFS) was 42.2 versus 71.8% (p = 0.03) and 2-year overall survival (OS) was 45.4 versus 78.9% (p = 0.02), respectively. Comparing between patients with PD-L2-positive and PD-L2-negative lymphoma, the 2-year EFS was 37.1 versus 82.4% (p = 0.02) and 2-year OS was 45.2 versus 82.4% (p = 0.03), respectively. Neither PD-1 nor PD-Ls expression in the stroma predicted outcomes. In conclusion, PD-Ls were frequently expressed on ENKTL cells and associated with inferior outcomes. Therefore, PD-Ls are potential prognostic biomarkers and the roles of immune checkpoint blockade therapy in ENKTL deserve further investigation.

Dichotomy of Local Th1- and Systemic Th2/Th3-Dependent Types of Immune Response in Rheumatoid Arthritis.||||||||Biomarkers of activity of rheumatoid arthritis were analyzed in the blood serum and synovial fluid of affected joints in 84 patients. Significant differences between the serum and synovial fluid levels were revealed for 10 of 17 analyzed biomarkers; the levels of IgM and proinflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-1β, IFNγ, and IL-6 were higher in the synovial fluid. The concentration of IL-10 in the synovial fluid was also elevated. In the peripheral blood, the content of antinuclear antibodies, circulating immune complexes, and cytokines IL-4 and TGF-β was elevated. These findings attest to the development of local Th1 type immune response in affected joints paralleled by compensatory elevation of immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 and systemic Th2/Th3 type immune response (judging from peripheral blood parameters) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Function and regulation of transforming growth factor β1 signalling in antler chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.||||||||Chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation are crucial for endochondral ossification, but their regulatory mechanism remains unclear. The present study aimed to determine the physiological function of TGFβ1 signalling in the proliferation and differentiation of antler chondrocytes and explore its relationship with Notch, Shh signalling and Foxa.||||Immunofluorescence, Western blot, MTS assay, flow cytometry, RNA interference and real-time PCR were used to analyse the function and regulatory mechanisms of TGFβ1 signalling in antler chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.||||TGFβ1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 were highly expressed in antler cartilage. TGFβ1 promoted chondrocyte proliferation, increased the proportion of S-phase cells and induced the expression of hypertrophic chondrocyte markers Col X, Runx2 and Alpl. However, this induction was weakened by TGFβ receptor inhibitor SB431542 and Smad3 inhibitor SIS3. Simultaneously, TGFβ1 activated Notch and Shh signalling whose blockage attenuated the above effects of rTGFβ1, whereas addition of rShh rescued the defects in chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation elicited by SB431542 and SIS3. Further analysis revealed that inhibition of Notch signalling impeded TGFβ1 activation of the Shh pathway. Knockdown of Foxa1, Foxa2 and Foxa3 abrogated the effects of TGFβ1 on chondrocyte differentiation. Notch and Shh signalling mediated the regulation of Foxa transcription factors by TGFβ1.||||TGFβ1 signalling could induce the proliferation and differentiation of antler chondrocytes through Notch-Shh-Foxa pathway.

Growth hormone upregulates the pro-tumorigenic galectin 1 in mouse liver.||||||||Transgenic mice overexpressing growth hormone (GH) spontaneously develop liver tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), within a year. The preneoplastic liver pathology in these mice recapitulates that observed in humans at high risk of developing hepatic cancer. Although increased expression of galectin 1 (GAL1) in liver tissue is associated with HCC aggressiveness, a link between this glycan-binding protein and hormone-related tumor development has not yet been explored. In this study, we investigated GAL1 expression during liver tumor progression in mice continuously exposed to high levels of GH. GAL1 expression was determined by Western blotting, RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry in the liver of transgenic mice overexpressing GH. Animals of representative ages at different stages of liver pathology were studied. GAL1 expression was upregulated in the liver of GH-transgenic mice. This effect was observed at early ages, when animals displayed no signs of liver disease or minimal histopathological alterations and was also detected in young adults with preneoplastic liver pathology. Remarkably, GAL1 upregulation was sustained during aging and its expression was particularly enhanced in liver tumors. GH also induced hepatic GAL1 expression in mice that were treated with this hormone for a short period. Moreover, GH triggered a rapid increment in GAL1 protein expression in human HCC cells, denoting a direct effect of the hormone on hepatocytes. Therefore, our results indicate that GH upregulates GAL1 expression in mouse liver, which may have critical implications in tumorigenesis. These findings suggest that this lectin could be implicated in hormone-driven liver carcinogenesis.

Macrophages on the Peritoneum are involved in Gastric Cancer Peritoneal Metastasis.||||||||Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) have been shown to support tumor growth and progression by various mechanisms. However, the roles of TAM in gastric cancer (GC) peritoneal metastasis remain elusive. To explore the roles of macrophages in the process of GC peritoneal metastasis, we performed the present study. Samples from the primary GC tumor beds, surgical margins, peritoneal metastatic lesions and surrounding tissue, and the Pouch of Douglas, were collected, fixed by formalin, and embedded with paraffin. Immunohistochemistry staining for macrophages markers was performed. The peritoneal lavage was obtained from a fraction of patients to analyze the ratios of epidermal growth factor (EGF)- and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-secreting macrophages in the peritoneal cavity. GC patients with peritoneal metastasis had increased levels of macrophages and alternatively activated macrophages in the peritoneum compared to those without dissemination. Patients bearing more macrophages in the peritoneum had a poorer prognosis. GC patients bearing peritoneal metastasis harbored an increased level of angiogenesis. Macrophages in the peritoneal cavity were a source of EGF and VEGF. Macrophages in the peritoneum of GC patients play a supportive role for peritoneal metastasis by producing EGF and VEGF. Macrophages in the peritoneum might be a therapeutic target in the future.

Tissues were further processed to evaluate cytokines levels through cytometric bead array. The treatment with BEZ (5 mg/kg) reduced social memory impairment in T41 mice. However, BEZ did not have any effect on altered Aβ levels, NeuN, or GFAP staining. The drug reduced the CD68/Iba-1 ratio in CA3 region of hippocampus. Finally, BEZ diminished IL-10 levels in T41 mice.

Paving the way for more precise diagnosis of EcPV2-associated equine penile lesions.||||||||There is growing evidence that equine papillomavirus type 2 (EcPV2) infection is causally associated with the development of equine genital squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Early stages of disease present clinically as plaques or wart-like lesions which can gradually progress to tumoural lesions. Histologically these lesions are inconsistently described as benign hyperplasia, papilloma, penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), carcinoma in situ (CIS) or SCC. Guidelines for histological classification of early SCC precursor lesions are not precisely defined, leading to potential misdiagnosis. The aim of this study was to identify histologic criteria and diagnostic markers allowing for a more accurate diagnosis of EcPV2-associated equine penile lesions.||||A total of 61 archived equine penile lesions were histologically re-assessed and classified as benign hyperplasia, papilloma, CIS or SCC. From these, 19 representative lesions and adjacent normal skin were comparatively analysed for the presence of EcPV2 DNA and transcripts using PCR and RNA in situ hybridisation (RISH). All lesional samples were positive by EcPV2 PCR and RISH, while adjacent normal skin was negative. RISH analysis yielded signal distribution patterns that allowed distinction of early (hyperplasia, papilloma) from late stage lesions (CIS, SCC). Subsequently, the 19 lesions were further assessed for expression of p53, Ki67, MCM7 and MMP1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC). All four proteins were expressed in both normal and lesional tissue. However, p53 expression was up-regulated in basal keratinocyte layers of papillomas, CIS and SCCs, as well as in upper keratinocyte layers of CIS and SCCs. MCM7 expression was only up-regulated in upper proliferating keratinocyte layers of papillomas, CIS and SCCs.||||This study proposes combining a refined histological protocol for analysis of equine penile lesions with PCR- and/or RISH based EcPV2-screening and p53/MCM7 IHC to more accurately determine the type of lesion. This may help to guide the choice of optimum treatment strategy, especially at early stages of disease.

Association of hepcidin and anemia in early chronic kidney disease.||||||||Hepcidin is being extensively studied for anemia and inflammation in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Hepcidin is thought to regulate iron metabolism by iron blockade through various mechanisms. Patients with CKD have early cardiac mortality due to anemia and subclinical inflammation; hence, we studied hepcidin as a biomarker in patients with early stage of CKD in relation to anemia and inflammation. In our cross-sectional study, a total of 80 patients were enrolled of whom, there were 25, 26, and 29 patients in CKD stages 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Patients were divided into normal iron level (39), functional iron deficiency (FID) (18), and absolute iron deficiency (AID) (23) based on transferrin saturation and ferritin. We found significantly high level of hepcidin (P <0.05) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (P <0.05) in FID as compared to AID as well as normal iron level. We also found other inflammatory markers such as albumin, transferrin, and ferritin to be significantly associated with FID. In univariate analysis, hemoglobin (Hb) varied significantly with serum total iron-binding capacity (r = 0.40, P <0.001), log hsCRP (r = -0.32, P <0.01), and log ferritin (r = -0.23, P <0.05); however, Hb was not affected significantly with log hepcidin (r = -0.07, P >0.05). The study indicates that among early CKD patients with FID, there was high level of hepcidin along with other inflammatory parameters, which may be associated with poor cardiovascular disease outcome due to increased inflammation.

Cancer-bone microenvironmental interactions promotes STAT3 signaling.||||||||Prostate cancer (PCa) patients' mortality is mainly attributed to complications caused by metastasis of the tumor cells to organs critical for survival, such as bone. We hypothesized that PCa cell-bone interactions would promote paracrine signaling. A panel of PCa cell lines were cocultured with hydroxyapatite ([HA]; inorganic component of bone) of different densities. Conditioned media (CM) was collected and analyzed for calcium levels and effect on paracrine signaling, cell migration, and viability in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that calcium levels were elevated in CM from cancer cell-bone cocultures, compared to media or cancer cells alone, and this could be antagonized by ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a calcium chelator, or knockdown of Snail protein. We also observed increased signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation and paracrine cell proliferation and migration in LNCaP cells incubated with CM from various cell lines; this phosphorylation and cell migration could be antagonized by Snail knockdown or various inhibitors including EGTA, STAT3 inhibitor (WP1066) or cathepsin L inhibitor (Z-FY-CHO). In vivo, higher HA bone density increased tumorigenicity and migration of tumor cells to HA implant. Our study shows that cancer-bone microenvironment interactions lead to calcium-STAT3 signaling, which may present an area for therapeutic targeting of metastatic PCa.

Trim the fat: the role of omega-3 fatty acids in psychopharmacology.||||||||The American Psychiatric Association (APA) currently recommends the use of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for depressive disorders, impulse-control disorders, and psychotic disorders in treatment guidelines. This review examines the evidence for efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and psychosis. Meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials of omega-3 fatty acids for depression are inconclusive, with strong evidence of publication bias, sizable heterogeneity between included studies, and substantial methodological shortcomings in included trials. The large amount of heterogeneity in findings of RCTs of omega-3 fatty acids for unipolar depression is likely attributable to highly heterogeneous sample populations that are given different omega-3 supplements [which differ widely in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) content, ratio, and dosage] as either adjunctive or monotherapy of other existing treatments, and then measure several different outcomes of depression symptomatology with likely incomplete blinding. Evidence of efficacy of omega-3 supplementation in treating psychosis, PTSD, anxiety, and bipolar mania is minimal. The current guidelines recommending the use of omega-3 fatty acids in adulthood psychiatric conditions should be revisited, especially given several recent negative studies examining the effects of omega-3 fatty acids for cardiovascular disease. Recommending likely ineffective treatment to patients, no matter how benign the side-effect profile, has opportunity cost (e.g. other more effective medications or therapies not being utilized) and likely affects patient compliance with other evidence-based treatments.

Intermittent rolling is a defect of the extravasation cascade caused by Myosin1e-deficiency in neutrophils.||||||||Neutrophil extravasation is a migratory event in response to inflammation that depends on cytoskeletal dynamics regulated by myosins. Myosin-1e (Myo1e) is a long-tailed class-I myosin that has not yet been studied in the context of neutrophil-endothelial interactions and neutrophil extravasation. Intravital microscopy of TNFα-inflamed cremaster muscles in Myo1e-deficient mice revealed that Myo1e is required for efficient neutrophil extravasation. Specifically, Myo1e deficiency caused increased rolling velocity, decreased firm adhesion, aberrant crawling, and strongly reduced transmigration. Interestingly, we observed a striking discontinuous rolling behavior termed "intermittent rolling," during which Myo1e-deficient neutrophils showed alternating rolling and jumping movements. Surprisingly, chimeric mice revealed that these effects were due to Myo1e deficiency in leukocytes. Vascular permeability was not significantly altered in Myo1e KO mice. Myo1e-deficient neutrophils showed diminished arrest, spreading, uropod formation, and chemotaxis due to defective actin polymerization and integrin activation. In conclusion, Myo1e critically regulates adhesive interactions of neutrophils with the vascular endothelium and neutrophil extravasation. Myo1e may therefore be an interesting target in chronic inflammatory diseases characterized by excessive neutrophil recruitment.

Visfatin Plays a Significant Role in Alleviating Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Apoptosis and Autophagy Through PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway During Acute Lung Injury in Mice.||||||||Visfatin is involved in the body's inflammation and immune response. Inflammation could promote, while visfatin may directly or indirectly mitigate the effects of apoptosis and autophagy. Whether visfatin lessens the detrimental effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse acute lung injury (ALI) is poorly understood yet. Therefore, in the current study, the regulation mechanism of visfatin on apoptosis and autophagy was explored in Kunming mice by replicating LPS-induced inflammatory ALI model. Based on the mouse model of ALI, HE staining, TUNEL, transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemical staining, real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR and western blot were used and the results showed that the alveolar septum was thinner than that of the LPS group, slight lung interstitial and alveolar exudation appeared, and a small number of inflammatory cell infiltration was found in the visfatin intervention group, indicating reduced tissue damage in lungs. After visfatin treatment, the expression of pro-apoptotic genes Bax, Bik, and p53 decreased and the expression of anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl increased, and expression of autophagy factors LC3 and Beclin1 decreased, indicating that visfatin inhibits apoptosis and reduces autophagy. The expression of PI3K and p-AKT was upregulated in the visfatin intervention group, the expression of AKT was downregulated, and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was activated. Hence, visfatin could activate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, reduce the apoptotic rate in alveolar epithelial cells and the level of autophagy in ALI by regulating the expression of autophagy factors, ultimately causing a protective effect on lung tissue.

Acute exercise and brain BACE1 protein content: a time course study.||||||||Obesity and insulin resistance are risk factors in the development of neurodegenerative disorders. Previous work suggests that one acute bout of exercise may have beneficial neuro-protective effects in obese mice. The rate limiting enzyme in the production of amyloid-beta peptides, BACE1, was reduced in the prefrontal cortex 2 h post-exercise, however if these effects remain over time is unknown. We aimed to determine how long exercise-induced alterations persist in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus following a single exercise bout. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed either a low (LFD, 10% kcals from lard) or a high fat diet (HFD, 60% kcals from lard) for 7 weeks. HFD mice then underwent an acute bout of treadmill running (15 m/min, 5% incline, 120 min) followed by 2-, 8-, or 24-h of recovery. The HFD increased body mass (LFD 27.8 ± 1.05 vs. HFD 41.7 ± 0.60 g; P < 0.05) and glucose intolerance (AUC LFD 63.27 ± 4.5 vs. HFD 128.9 ± 4.6; P < 0.05). Prefrontal cortex BACE1 content was reduced 2- and 8-h post-exercise compared to sedentary HFD mice, however BACE1 protein content at 24 h was not different. Hippocampal BACE1 content was reduced 8- and 24-h post-exercise. Compared to the LFD, the HFD had higher prefrontal cortex phosphorylation of p38, JNK, and AMPK, indicative of increased neuronal stress. Post-exercise prefrontal cortex p38 and JNK phosphorylation were no different between the HFD or LFD groups, while ERK phosphorylation was significantly reduced by 24 h. The HFD increased JNK phosphorylation in the hippocampus. These results demonstrate the direct and potent effects of exercise on reducing BACE1 prefrontal cortex and hippocampal content. However the reduction in prefrontal cortex BACE1 content is short lived.

Cullin 3 overexpression inhibits lung cancer metastasis and is associated with survival of lung adenocarcinoma.||||||||Cullin 3 (CUL3), a molecular scaffold of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase, plays an important role in regulating biological processes through modulating the ubiquitylation and degradation of various protein substrates. Dysfunction of CUL3 is implicated in the development of several human diseases. However, the clinical significance and prognostic value of CUL3 in lung cancer have not been investigated. This study investigated the CUL3-modulating potential of non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, H1299, H358, H2170 and H520, by using immunoblotting, MTT, migration, invasion, colony formation and in vivo tumorigenicity assays. The prognostic significance of CUL3 was measured by public KM plotter database ( http://kmplot.com/analysis/index.php?p=service&cancer=breast ) and tissue immunohistochemistry analysis. The public online database analysis revealed that elevated mRNA expression of CUL3 was associated with better prognosis for non-small cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma. In vitro experiments showed that ectopic overexpression of CUL3 significantly inhibited lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation and migration, and the tumor-suppressive effect of CUL3 was dependent on the Nrf2/RhoA axis. In vivo mice model demonstrated that overexpression of CUL3 lead to a significant reduction of lung adenocarcinoma growth and metastasis. Importantly, tissue immunohistochemistry analysis showed that about 47% of non-small cell lung cancer tissues were expressed of CUL3 at high levels. Overexpression of CUL3 predicted favorable overall survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients, especially in lung adenocarcinoma, but not in lung squamous cell carcinoma patients. CUL3 could serve as a prognostic biomarker for lung adenocarcinoma. Loss of CUL3 might be driving tumorigenesis by activating the Nrf2/RhoA pathway.

Decoding the link between WWOX and p53 in aggressive breast cancer.||||||||Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are aggressive forms of human breast cancer with poor prognosis and limited treatment response. Molecular understanding of BLBC and TNBC biology is instrumental to improve detection and management of these deadly diseases. Tumor suppressors WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) and TP53 are altered in BLBC and in TNBC. Nevertheless, the functional interplay between WWOX and p53 is poorly understood. In a recent study by Abdeen and colleagues, it has been demonstrated that WWOX loss drives BLBC formation via deregulating p53 functions. In this review, we highlight important signaling pathways regulated by WWOX and p53 that are related to estrogen receptor signaling, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and genomic instability and how they impact BLBC and TNBC development.

Expression of p63 in tooth germ, dentigerous cyst and ameloblastoma.||||||||To assess the role of p63, a p53 homolog, in the cytodifferentiation (odontogenesis) and oncogenesis of odontogenic epithelium.||||The present study aimed to compare the expression pattern of p63 in the epithelium of tooth germ, dentigerous cyst (DC) and ameloblastoma (AB).||||Tissue specimens of thirty tooth germs, thirty ABs and thirty DCs were examined by immunohistochemistry for the expression of p63. Results: p63 labeling index (LI) was observed in descending order in epithelial cells of ABs, tooth germs and DCs. p63 LI was statistically nonsignificant among all the three groups. ABs revealed the highest p63 expression, but, surprisingly, tooth germs showed higher expression than DCs.||||p63 plays a role in the cytodifferentiation and proliferation of odontogenic epithelial cells irrespective of the tissue (normal developing or lesional tissue). This implies that p63 cannot be used as a diagnostic marker. However, our results indicate p63 overexpression as a mark of increased proliferation. Thus, it can be stipulated that p63 can be used as a prognostic marker in odontogenic lesions with more aggressive and invasive phenotype. Our results also suggest the differential function of p63 in both developing and lesional odontogenic tissues, which, however, depends on p63 isoform predominantly being expressed. Therefore, identification of p63-predominant isoform in a particular lesion is more important than the presence or absence of p63. Consequently, we suggest the performance of polymerase chain reaction analysis along with immunohistochemical evaluation in further studies.

At thermoneutrality, acute thyroxine-induced thermogenesis and pyrexia are independent of UCP1.||||||||Hyperthyroidism is associated with increased metabolism ("thyroid thermogenesis") and elevated body temperature, often referred to as hyperthermia. Uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) is the protein responsible for nonshivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. We here examine whether UCP1 is essential for thyroid thermogenesis.||||We investigated the significance of UCP1 for thyroid thermogenesis by using UCP1-ablated (UCP1 KO) mice. To avoid confounding factors from cold-induced thermogenesis and to approach human conditions, the experiments were conducted at thermoneutrality, and to resemble conditions of endogenous release, thyroid hormone (thyroxine, T4) was injected peripherally.||||Both short-term and chronic thyroxine treatment led to a marked increase in metabolism that was largely UCP1-independent. Chronic thyroxine treatment led to a 1-2 °C increase in body temperature. This increase was also UCP1-independent and was maintained even at lower ambient temperatures. Thus, it was pyrexia, i.e. a defended increase in body temperature, not hyperthermia. In wildtype mice, chronic thyroxine treatment induced a large relative increase in the total amounts of UCP1 in the brown adipose tissue (practically no UCP1 in brite/beige adipose tissue), corresponding to an enhanced thermogenic response to norepinephrine injection. The increased UCP1 amount had minimal effects on thyroxine-induced thermogenesis and pyrexia.||||These results establish that thyroid thermogenesis is a UCP1-independent process. The fact that the increased metabolism coincides with elevated body temperature and thus with accelerated kinetics accentuates the unsolved issue of the molecular background for thyroid thermogenesis.

Wnt5a promotes differentiation and development of adult-born neurons in the hippocampus by noncanonical Wnt signaling.||||||||In the adult hippocampus, new neurons are generated in the dentate gyrus. The Wnt signaling pathway regulates this process, but little is known about the endogenous Wnt ligands involved. We investigated the role of Wnt5a on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Wnt5a regulates neuronal morphogenesis during embryonic development, and maintains dendritic architecture of pyramidal neurons in the adult hippocampus. Here, we determined that Wnt5a knockdown in the mouse dentate gyrus by lentivirus-mediated shRNA impaired neuronal differentiation of progenitor cells, and reduced dendritic development of adult-born neurons. In cultured adult hippocampal progenitors (AHPs), Wnt5a knockdown reduced neuronal differentiation and morphological development of AHP-derived neurons, whereas treatment with Wnt5a had the opposite effect. Interestingly, no changes in astrocytic differentiation were observed in vivo or in vitro, suggesting that Wnt5a does not affect fate-commitment. By using specific inhibitors, we determined that Wnt5a signals through CaMKII to induce neurogenesis, and promotes dendritic development of newborn neurons through activating Wnt/JNK and Wnt/CaMKII signaling. Our results indicate Wnt5a as a niche factor in the adult hippocampus that promotes neuronal differentiation and development through activation of noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways.

The spleen in obese patients is associated with the cardiovascular system. Enlargement of the spleen is suggestive of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Patients with NASH present an increase in growth factor (HGF) as well as those with advanced heart failure. Interleukin-16 and interleukin-12p40 levels were found to correlate significantly with BMI, and waist circumference.||||We tried to find a relationship between BMR, spleen length and HGF.||||We analysed retrospective data from 80 obese patients with NAFLD. We evaluated indices of indirect calorimetry by the bioimpendance analysis; carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), spleen length (SLD) and HS by ultrasonography; serum HGF, IL-16, IL-12p40 and IL-6 concentrations by a magnetic bead-based multiplex immunoassays and the severity of NAFLD by BARD score > 2.|||| < 0.001). IL-6 concentrations, but not BMR were influential in the prediction of HS by SLD.||||These data reinforce the concept that the immune system is a sensor of the metabolic state, showing a link between HGF levels and BMR, which is mediated by IL-16 (cytokine inducing a cascade of inflammatory factors), and ascertaining the influential effect of the spleen, as main immune organ.

Efficacy of a Bispecific Antibody Co-Targeting VEGFA and Ang-2 in Combination with Chemotherapy in a Chemoresistant Colorectal Carcinoma Xenograft Model.||||||||Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition by the addition of bevacizumab to the chemotherapy regimen of metastatic colorectal cancer leads to an improved outcome. However, anti-angiogenic tumor therapy targeting a single factor may be limited by complementary mechanisms. Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2, ANGPT2) is another important factor that cooperates with VEGF to drive tumor angiogenesis. It was shown that high Ang-2 levels are associated with a poor clinical outcome of colorectal cancer patients treated with bevacizumab-containing therapy. Therefore, combined inhibition of VEGF and Ang-2 was supposed to improve anti-angiogenic therapy. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of a bispecific antibody (CrossMab) co-targeting VEGF and Ang-2 in combination with chemotherapy in a chemoresistant colorectal carcinoma model. Antitumor activity was evaluated in athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous DLD1 xenograft tumors and treated with anti-VEGF (B20), anti-Ang-2 (LC06) and anti-VEGF/Ang-2 (CrossMab) antibodies. Chemotherapy consisted of 5-FU and irinotecan. Resected tumors were analyzed immunohistochemically. First, an impact of targeting each single factor but also a clear advantage of co-targeting both factors could be demonstrated. Accordingly, tumor tissue showed strong staining for VEGF and Ang-2. Chemotherapy alone was less effective. Efficient tumor growth inhibition could be achieved by treatment with anti-VEGF/chemotherapy, single CrossMab and CrossMab/chemotherapy, which resulted in 3 out of 10, 6 out of 10 and 10 out of 10 complete responses, respectively, during seven weeks. Complete retarded tumors were characterized by massive intratumoral necrosis surrounded by layers of vital tumor cells and connective tissue with CD31-positive vessels at the periphery. In some cases, a distinct feature known as vessel co-option could be observed. In conclusion, the data from this model clearly support the strategy of co-targeting VEGF and Ang-2 and further demonstrate the beneficial impact of co-treatment with chemotherapy. The clear superiority of the CrossMab-containing regimen compared to clinical standard anti-VEGF/chemotherapy warrants further analyses in other models.

Apolipoprotein E genotypes were detected in oral mucosa of subjects. Serum lipids before and after 12 weeks high intensity interval training were measured to analysis the effect of high intensity interval training on serum lipids.||||Five genotypes were detected in 88 cases of dyslipidemia. The distributions were ApoE3/3＞ApoE3/4＞ApoE2/3＞ApoE2/2＞ApoE2/4,and allele ε3＞ε2=ε4. Before exercise intervention, the level of total cholesterol in patients with ε4 allele was significant higher than those in patients with ε2 and ε3 (P＜0.01), low density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with ε4 was significant higher than that of patients with ε2 (P＜0.05), and the other indexes had no significant difference among the groups (P＞ 0.05). After 12 weeks high intensity interval training, the levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride and low density lipoprotein cholesterol were decreased significantly ,while the level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol was increased in those patients with ε3 genotype. For those individuals with ε4 genotype , their serum levels of total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol were reduced after 12 weeks high intensity interval training , but there was no changes in serum levels of triglyceride and high density lipoprotein cholesterol. For those individuals with ε2 genotype, there was no significant improvement in serum lipids after 12 weeks high intensity interval training interventions.||||The polymorphisms of apolipoprotein E gene resulted in different effects of exercise interventions on serum lipids of dyslipidemia. Twelve weeks high intensity interval training can be used as an intervention method to regulate serum lipids of dyslipidemia with ε3 and ε4 alleles.

Circadian regulation and molecular role of the Bsx homeobox gene in the adult pineal gland.||||||||The pineal gland is a neuroendocrine organ responsible for production of the nocturnal hormone melatonin. A specific set of homeobox gene-encoded transcription factors govern pineal development, and some are expressed in adulthood. The brain-specific homeobox gene (Bsx) falls into both categories. We here examined regulation and function of Bsx in the mature pineal gland of the rat. We report that Bsx is expressed from prenatal stages into adulthood, where Bsx transcripts are localized in the melatonin-synthesizing pinealocytes, as revealed by RNAscope in situ hybridization. Bsx transcripts were also detected in the adult human pineal gland. In the rat pineal gland, Bsx was found to exhibit a 10-fold circadian rhythm with a peak at night. By combining in vivo adrenergic stimulation and surgical denervation of the gland in the rat with in vitro stimulation and transcriptional inhibition in cultured pinealocytes, we show that rhythmic expression of Bsx is controlled at the transcriptional level by the sympathetic neural input to the gland acting via adrenergic stimulation with cyclic AMP as a second messenger. siRNA-mediated knockdown (>80% reduction) in pinealocyte cultures revealed Bsx to be a negative regulator of other pineal homeobox genes, including paired box 4 (Pax4), but no effect on genes encoding melatonin-synthesizing enzymes was detected. RNA sequencing analysis performed on siRNA-treated pinealocytes further revealed that downstream target genes of Bsx are mainly involved in developmental processes. Thus, rhythmic Bsx expression seems to govern other developmental regulators in the mature pineal gland.

Cardiac troponin I in cats with compromised renal function.||||||||Cardiac troponins are sensitive and specific markers of myocardial injury. However, their reliability in renal disease has been questioned owing to possible renal involvement in troponin elimination. The primary objective of the present study was to examine whether serum cardiac troponin I is elevated in cats with compromised renal function and no clinically relevant structural cardiac disease. A secondary objective was to examine whether cardiac troponin I is measurable in the urine of cats with normal and compromised renal function.||||This prospective case-control study included 52 cats (19 with compromised renal function, 19 with primary cardiac disease and 14 healthy controls). For all cats, clinical examination, echocardiography, electrocardiography, blood pressure, complete blood count, biochemistry, serum thyroxine and urinalysis were performed. Cardiac troponin I was measured in the serum and urine of each cat.||||Median (range) serum cardiac troponin I concentrations were 0.052 ng/ml (0.015-0.78 ng/ml) for the renal group, 0.083 ng/ml (0.003-3.27 ng/ml) for the cardiac group and 0.012 ng/ml (0.003-0.14 ng/ml) for the control group. The renal and cardiac groups both had significantly higher serum cardiac troponin I concentrations than the control group, whereas no difference could be detected between the renal and cardiac groups. In the renal group 7/19 cats had measurable urine cardiac troponin I, whereas cardiac troponin I was measurable in the urine of one cat in the cardiac group and two healthy controls. There was no significant correlation between serum and urine cardiac troponin I.||||Elevated serum cardiac troponin I in cats with compromised renal function may occur without evidence of clinically relevant structural cardiac disease. Moreover, detecting cardiac troponin I in urine is most likely in cats with compromised renal function.

In this work, the localization of Mel1b receptor was studied in pigeon retina using double immunohistochemistry staining and confocal scanning microscopy. Our results showed that Mel1b receptor widely existed in the outer segment of photoreceptors and in the somata of dopaminergic amacrine cells, cholinergic amacrine cells, glycinergic AII amacrine cells, conventional ganglion cells and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, while horizontal cells, bipolar cells and Müller glial cells seemed to lack immunoreactivity of Mel1b receptor. That multiple types of retinal cells expressing Mel1b receptor suggests melatonin may directly modulate the activities of retina via activating Mel1b receptor.

CUL3 Deficiency Causes Social Deficits and Anxiety-like Behaviors by Impairing Excitation-Inhibition Balance through the Promotion of Cap-Dependent Translation.||||||||Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders with symptoms including social deficits, anxiety, and communication difficulties. However, ASD pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood. Mutations of CUL3, which encodes Cullin 3 (CUL3), a component of an E3 ligase complex, are thought of as risk factors for ASD and schizophrenia (SCZ). CUL3 is abundant in the brain, yet little is known of its function. Here, we show that CUL3 is critical for neurodevelopment. CUL3-deficient mice exhibited social deficits and anxiety-like behaviors with enhanced glutamatergic transmission and neuronal excitability. Proteomic analysis revealed eIF4G1, a protein for Cap-dependent translation, as a potential target of CUL3. ASD-associated cellular and behavioral deficits could be rescued by pharmacological inhibition of the eIF4G1 function and chemogenetic inhibition of neuronal activity. Thus, CUL3 is critical to neural development, neurotransmission, and excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance. Our study provides novel insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of ASD and SCZ.

Diosgenin inhibits the expression of NEDD4 in prostate cancer cells.||||||||Prostate cancer is the second most common malignancy among men and causes a myriad of health problem for males that are diagnosed with the cancer. Although the 5-year relative survival rate of prostate cancer patients has been significantly increased due to prostate-specific antigen testing and treatment advances, patients that develop metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer continue to have poor survival rates. Thus, it is critical to discover new therapeutics to treat prostate cancer. Diosgenin is a steroidal saponin from Trigonella foenum graecum, which has been previously identified to exert anti-tumor properties. Neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4 (NEDD4) is an E3 ligase that degrades multiple different proteins, and plays an oncogenic role in human cancer. In this study, we explore the molecular mechanism by which diosgenin mediates anti-tumor effects in prostate cancer cells. We found that diosgenin treatment led to cell growth inhibition, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Notably, we found that diosgenin inhibited the expression of NEDD4 in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, overexpression of NEDD4 overcame the diosgenin-mediated anti-tumor activity, while downregulation of NEDD4 promoted the diosgenin-induced anti-cancer function in prostate cancer cells. Our findings indicate that diosgenin is a potential new inhibitor of NEDD4 in prostate cancer cells.

Docking protein-1 promotes inflammatory macrophage signaling in gastric cancer.|||||||| mRNA and DOK1 protein expression were downregulated in tumor cells of gastric cancer patients (n = 249). Conversely, its expression was up-regulated in cases positive for Epstein Barr Virus (EBV+) together with genes related to macrophage biology and targets of clinical immunotherapy such as programmed-cell-death-ligand-1 (PD-L1). Notably, high DOK1 positivity in stroma cells conferred poor prognosis in patients and correlated with high levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase in CD68+ tumor-associated macrophages. In macrophages derived from human monocytic leukemia cell lines, DOK1 (i) was inducible by agonists of the anti-diabetic transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ), (ii) increased polarization towards an inflammatory phenotype, (iii) augmented nuclear factor-κB-dependent transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and (iv) reduced PD-L1 expression. These properties empowered DOK1+ macrophages to decrease the viability of human gastric cancer cells in contact-dependent co-cultures. DOK1 also reduced PD-L1 expression in human primary blood monocytes. Our data propose that the drugability of DOK1 may be exploited to reprogram myeloid cells and enforce the innate immune response against EBV+ human gastric cancer.

Association between serum transaminase levels and insulin resistance in euthyroid and non-diabetic adults.||||||||To evaluate the association between elevated serum transaminase levels and insulin resistance (IR) in a population of healthy individuals.||||We define IR with a cut-off point of homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) ≥ 3.8. For aspartate aminotransferase (AST), we consider elevated values >30 U/L in women and values >36 U/L in men. For alanine aminotransferase (ALT), we consider elevated values >30 U/L in women and values >40 U/L in men. We performed a crude and adjusted generalized linear model from Poisson family with robust variance, in order to evaluate the association between elevated serum transaminase levels and IR. The associations were presented as prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).||||We included 261 participants in the study. The median age was 39 years (31-45) and 23.7% of the participants were men. The prevalence of elevated serum transaminase for AST and ALT were, 13.8% and 26.1%, respectively. The prevalence of IR was 34.1%. In the crude analysis we found statistical significance between elevated AST and ALT with IR (PR = 3.18; 95% CI: 2.33-4.34 and PR = 2.44; 95% CI: 1.88-3.30; respectively). However, in the multivariate analysis, the association only remained statistically significance with ALT, but lost its significance with AST, PR = 1.90; CI 95%: 1.31-2.77 and a PR = 1.23; CI 95%: 0.93-1.61; respectively.||||Elevated serum levels of ALT were associated with insulin resistance. ALT could be used in clinical practice as an additional tool to assess IR in apparently healthy people.

Function and regulation of transforming growth factor β1 signalling in antler chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.||||||||Chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation are crucial for endochondral ossification, but their regulatory mechanism remains unclear. The present study aimed to determine the physiological function of TGFβ1 signalling in the proliferation and differentiation of antler chondrocytes and explore its relationship with Notch, Shh signalling and Foxa.||||Immunofluorescence, Western blot, MTS assay, flow cytometry, RNA interference and real-time PCR were used to analyse the function and regulatory mechanisms of TGFβ1 signalling in antler chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.||||TGFβ1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 were highly expressed in antler cartilage. TGFβ1 promoted chondrocyte proliferation, increased the proportion of S-phase cells and induced the expression of hypertrophic chondrocyte markers Col X, Runx2 and Alpl. However, this induction was weakened by TGFβ receptor inhibitor SB431542 and Smad3 inhibitor SIS3. Simultaneously, TGFβ1 activated Notch and Shh signalling whose blockage attenuated the above effects of rTGFβ1, whereas addition of rShh rescued the defects in chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation elicited by SB431542 and SIS3. Further analysis revealed that inhibition of Notch signalling impeded TGFβ1 activation of the Shh pathway. Knockdown of Foxa1, Foxa2 and Foxa3 abrogated the effects of TGFβ1 on chondrocyte differentiation. Notch and Shh signalling mediated the regulation of Foxa transcription factors by TGFβ1.||||TGFβ1 signalling could induce the proliferation and differentiation of antler chondrocytes through Notch-Shh-Foxa pathway.

Transformation of the dermal collagen framework under laser heating.||||||||The aim of this study was to compare between the changes undergone by the dermal collagen framework when heated by IR laser radiation and by traditional means and to reveal the specific features of the dermal matrix modification under moderate IR laser irradiation. Rabbit skin specimens were heated to 50°C, 55°C, 60°C and 65°C in a calorimeter furnace and with a 1.68-μm fiber Raman laser. The proportion of the degraded collagen macromolecules was determined by differential scanning calorimetry. Changes in the architectonics of the collagen framework were revealed by using standard, phase-contrast, polarization optical and scanning electron microscopy techniques. The collagen denaturation and dermal matrix amorphization temperature in the case of laser heating proved to be lower by 10°C than that for heating in the calorimeter furnace. The IR laser treatment of the skin was found to cause a specific low-temperature (45°C-50°C) transformation of its collagen framework, with some collagen macromolecules remaining intact. The transformation reduces to the splitting of collagen bundles and distortion of the course of collagen fibers. The denaturation of collagen macromolecules in the case of traditional heating takes its course in a threshold manner, so that their pre-denaturation morphological changes are insignificant.

TG3 is important for proper development of the skin and hair shaft, and knock-out mice for the Tgm3 gene are sensitive to UVB-induced photodamage due to aberrations in cornified envelope formation. Loss of TG3 is reported in head and neck and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, yet, its expression in skin cancer has not been studied. The aim of the present study was to analyse the expression pattern of TG3 in skin cancer. TG3 expression was investigated based on immunohistochemical staining of a tissue micro-array of different types of skin cancer, as well as meta-analysis of public gene array data. Our findings demonstrated that TG3 is normally expressed in spinous/granular layers of the epidermis, but is absent in melanocytes as well as melanoma samples. As expected, its expression was absent in poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Surprisingly, we show that samples of basal cell carcinoma demonstrated strong staining for TG3 both in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, at the mRNA level, the expression pattern of TGM3 was crucially altered in BCC, but not other types of skin cancer. These findings lead to new questions regarding TG3 involvement in basal cell carcinoma tumourigenesis. Moreover, the expression pattern of TG3 renders it a potential specific marker for basal cell carcinoma diagnosis.

Evaluation of VEGF, FGF and PDGF and Serum Levels of Inflammatory Cytokines in Patients with Glioma and Meningioma in Southern Iran.||||||||Meningioma and glioma are common central nervous system tumors. Hypoxic tumor cells secrete angiogenic cytokines, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) that stimulate neovascular formation and inflammatory cytokine, such as TNF-α and IL-1β. We measured these serum levels in patients with glial cell tumors and meningioma.||||This was a case-control study in 2014-2015 on patients diagnosed with meningioma/glioma. All demographic and clinical data were registered. The tumor volume and intraoperative bleeding were recorded. Serum levels of VEGF, PDGF, FGF, TNF-α and IL-1β were measured by ELISA methods.||||Ninety-six patients were enrolled in this study, 32 in each group. Patients VEGF level with cranial tumor, glioma/meningioma had increased. VEGF level was highest among grade IV tumors, larger tumors, and in glioblastoma multiform. There was an upsurge in VEGF serum level as glioma grade increased. The highest VEGF levels were seen in parasagittal meningioma. In contrast to VEGF, PDGF was slightly elevated in glial cell tumors, which was significantly elevated in meningioma. Higher PDGF correlated with increased intraoperative bleeding, especially in meningioma cases. Oligodendroglial tumors expressed higher PDGF levels in contrast to other glial tumors. FGF level was not statistically significant. TNF-α and IL-1β expressions were significantly higher in the meningioma and glioma group in comparison to control group.||||We found increased VEGF and PDGF serum levels in CNS patient's tumor. A different role for PDGF was found in the pathogenesis of neovascularization of meningioma, as well as oligodendroglioma. No significant result was found for FGF. TNF-α and IL-1β can serve as key prognostic biomarker in high-grade glioma and meningioma patients.

KLF9 aggravates ischemic injury in cardiomyocytes through augmenting oxidative stress.||||||||Cardiomyocyte injury caused by excessive oxidative stress underlies the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction (MI), a devastating disease leading to heart failure and death. The Krüppel-like factor 9 (KLF9) is a transcriptional factor that has recently been reported to regulate oxidative stress, however, whether it is associated with cardiomyocyte injury and MI is unknown. We found that KLF9 was upregulated in the heart from a rat MI model. In addition, KLF9 was also upregulated in cardiomyocytes exposed to ischemia in vitro, suggesting that KLF9 responds to MI-relevant stimuli. Moreover, KLF9 knockdown protected cardiomyocytes against ischemic injury. Mechanistically, KLF9 knockdown reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in ischemic cardiomyocytes through upregulating the antioxidant thioredoxin reductase 2 (Txnrd2), and more important, Txnrd2 silencing abrogated KLF9 knockdown-mediated cardioprotection in ischemic cardiomyocytes. Altogether, these results suggest that KLF9 aggravates ischemic injury in cardiomyocytes through undermining Txnrd2-mediated ROS clearance, which might offer KLF9 as a possible target in alleviating MI.

Diverse transcription factors control monoterpene synthase expression in lavender (Lavandula).||||||||We cloned eight transcription factors that activate lavender monoterpene synthase promoters. In this study, we employed the Yeast One-Hybrid (Y1H) assay system to identify transcription factors that control promoters for two Lavandula × intermedia monoterpene synthase genes, linalool synthase (LiLINS) and 1,8-cineole synthase (LiCINS). The bait sequences used in the assay were either a 768-bp LiLINS, or a 1087-bp LiCINS promoter. The prey included proteins expressed in L. × intermedia floral tissue. The assay identified 96 sequences encoding proteins that interacted with one or both promoters. To explore the nature of this interaction, the LiLINS and LiCINS promoter fragments were each fused to the E. coli gusA (GUS) reporter gene. The constructs were separately transformed into tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves co-expressing individually a subset of ten representative transcription factors (TFs) predicted to control these promoters. Six TFs induced expression from both promoters, two activated LiCINS promoter alone, and two did not induce expression from either promoter. The TFs identified in this study belong to various groups including those containing conserved domains typical of MYB, bZIP, NAC, GeBP and SBP-related proteins.

Silver Nanoparticle-Based Assay for the Detection of Immunoglobulin Free Light Chains.||||||||There is a wide spectrum of malignant diseases that are connected with the clonal proliferation of plasma cells, which cause the production of complete immunoglobulins or their fragments (heavy or light immunoglobulin chains). These proteins may accumulate in tissues, leading to end organ damage. The quantitative determination of immunoglobulin free light chains (FLCs) is considered to be the gold standard in the detection and treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) and amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis. In this study, a silver nanoparticle-based diagnostic tool for the quantitation of FLCs is presented. The optimal test conditions were achieved when a metal nanoparticle (MNP) was covered with 10 particles of an antibody and conjugated by 5-50 protein antigen particles (FLCs). The formation of the second antigen protein corona was accompanied by noticeable changes in the surface plasmon resonance spectra of the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), which coincided with an increase of the hydrodynamic diameter and increase in the zeta potential, as demonstrated by dynamic light scattering (DLS). A decrease of repulsion forces and the formation of antigen-antibody bridges resulted in the agglutination of AgNPs, as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy and the direct formation of AgNP aggregates. Antigen-conjugated AgNPs clusters were also found by direct observation using green laser light scattering. The parameters of the specific immunochemical aggregation process consistent with the sizes of AgNPs and the protein particles that coat them were confirmed by four physical methods, yielding complementary data concerning a clinically useful AgNPs aggregation test.

STYK1/NOK correlates with ferroptosis in non-small cell lung carcinoma.||||||||Serine Threonine Tyrosine Kinase 1 (STYK1) presents oncogenic properties in many studies, and emerging evidence suggests that ferroptosis serve as a novel tumor suppressor. However, the interplay between STYK1 and ferroptosis in NSCLC remains unclear. Our aim is to illustrate the expression of ferroptotic regulator Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) in NSCLC and the relationship between STYK1 and ferroptosis. Herein, results based on ONCOMINE database, clinical specimens, and cellular manipulation revealed GPX4 was upregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines, and high GPX4 expression predicted worse prognosis. High STYK1 expression predicted worse OS and was related to high GPX4 in NSCLC tissues; overexpression of STYK1 in lung cancer cell line SW900 upregulated the expression of GPX4, promoted proliferation, and attenuated diverse mitochondrial abnormalities specific to ferroptosis, whereas knockdown of GPX4 exacerbated such attenuations without affecting cell proliferation. Taken together, ferroptosis as an anti-tumor factor is inhibited in NSCLC, and targeting ferroptosis could be a novel therapeutic strategy for the management of NSCLC; furthermore, regulating ferroptosis could be another cancerous mechanism of STYK1.

Is there any potential anticancer effect of raloxifene and fluoxetine on DMBA-induced rat breast cancer?||||||||Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the world and the incidence is increasing alarmingly. It was aimed to determine the effect of raloxifene (RAL) and fluoxetine (FLX) on selected parameters in 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary carcinoma. Thirty-two female Wistar albino rats were assorted into four groups: DMBA (group I), DMBA+RAL (group II), DMBA+FLX (group III), and DMBA+RAL+FLX (group IV). Mammary tissue vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) levels were determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The tissue VEGF levels were lower in group IV compared with DMBA group. Decreased M-CSF levels were observed in all therapeutic groups rather than the DMBA group, but the most effective decrease was found in group IV. Compared with the DMBA group, MMP-9 levels were statistically significantly decreased in group II and group IV. However, TIMP-1 levels were higher in the whole therapeutic groups rather than the DMBA group and the most effective increase was observed in group IV. Results of the present study suggest that combined therapy of RAL with FLX might lead to a better outcome targeting breast tumor.

Transcriptome analysis of the distal small intestine of Cftr null mice.||||||||Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CFTR anion channel. Loss of CFTR function in pancreatic, biliary and intestinal epithelia, severely affects gastrointestinal function. Transcriptome analysis indicated the activation of an innate and adaptive immune response in the distal small intestine of Cftr null mice. Inflammation was associated with differential regulation of numerous genes involved in the transport and metabolism of nutrients and, particularly, lipids, that are targeted by ligand-dependent nuclear receptors and/or HNF4α. Among the most strongly down-regulated genes are the FXR targets Fgf15 and Nr0b2, the PPARα target Pdk4, and the PXR target Ces2a, whereas expression of the CF modifier gene Slc6a14 was strongly increased. Most changes in gene expression were reversed by bacterial containment. Our data suggest that the gut microbiota has a pervasive effect on gene expression in CF mice, affecting enterocyte maturation, lipid metabolism, and nutrient absorption in CF.

Intermittent rolling is a defect of the extravasation cascade caused by Myosin1e-deficiency in neutrophils.||||||||Neutrophil extravasation is a migratory event in response to inflammation that depends on cytoskeletal dynamics regulated by myosins. Myosin-1e (Myo1e) is a long-tailed class-I myosin that has not yet been studied in the context of neutrophil-endothelial interactions and neutrophil extravasation. Intravital microscopy of TNFα-inflamed cremaster muscles in Myo1e-deficient mice revealed that Myo1e is required for efficient neutrophil extravasation. Specifically, Myo1e deficiency caused increased rolling velocity, decreased firm adhesion, aberrant crawling, and strongly reduced transmigration. Interestingly, we observed a striking discontinuous rolling behavior termed "intermittent rolling," during which Myo1e-deficient neutrophils showed alternating rolling and jumping movements. Surprisingly, chimeric mice revealed that these effects were due to Myo1e deficiency in leukocytes. Vascular permeability was not significantly altered in Myo1e KO mice. Myo1e-deficient neutrophils showed diminished arrest, spreading, uropod formation, and chemotaxis due to defective actin polymerization and integrin activation. In conclusion, Myo1e critically regulates adhesive interactions of neutrophils with the vascular endothelium and neutrophil extravasation. Myo1e may therefore be an interesting target in chronic inflammatory diseases characterized by excessive neutrophil recruitment.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the association between EZH2 and EMT, and their prognostic significance.||||EZH2 and the EMT markers E-cadherin and Vimentin were examined by IHC in lung adenocarcinoma specimens that were resected from 2003-2012. Associations between EZH2 and EMT markers and their correlations with survival were analyzed.||||We enrolled 350 patients, approximately 70% of whom were diagnosed as pathological stage I. The rates of positive E-cadherin, Vimentin, and EZH2 expression were 60.3%, 21.4%, and 52.0%, respectively. There was a significant positive correlation between EZH2 and Vimentin expression (p = 0.008), and EZH2 scores were higher in the Mesenchymal group (p = 0.030). In multivariate analysis, EZH2 was an independent predictor of Vimentin expression, and vice versa. EMT and EZH2 overexpression were significantly correlated with poor disease-free and overall survival. Furthermore, the Epithelial group with high EZH2 expression had significantly worse disease-free and overall survival. Positive staining for EMT markers was unfavorable regarding disease-free survival among patients with low EZH2 expression.||||EMT and high EZH2 expression were associated with poor NSCLC prognoses.

Role of mTOR complex in IGF-1 induced neural differentiation of DPSCs.||||||||Recent studies have demonstrated that IGF-1 modulates the pluripotent differentiation of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). Although mTOR pathway activation has been showed as responsible for IGF-1 induced pluripotent differentiation, the mechanism that the IGF-1-mTOR pathway induces the neural differentiation of DPSCs is still unclear. In our research, we have demonstrated that 0-10 ng/mL IGF-1 had no obvious effect on the proliferation of DPSCs, but IGF-1 nonetheless enhances the neural differentiation of DPSCs in a dose-dependent manner. Simultaneously, we found that phosphorylated mTOR was up-regulated, which indicated the involvement of mTOR in the process. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR activity, can reverse the effect of DPSCs stimulated by IGF-1. Next, we studied the role of mTORC1 and mTORC2, two known mTOR complexes, in the neural differentiation of DPSCs. We found that inhibition of mTORC1 can severely restricts the neural differentiation of DPSCs. However, inhibition of mTORC2 has the opposite effect. This latter effect disappears when both rictor and mTOR are inhibited, showing that the mTORC2 effect is mTORC1 dependent. This study has expanded the role of mTOR in DPSCs neural differentiation regulated by IGF-1.

This work will elucidate the effect of miR-494 on EndMT and development of HCC. Therefore, the differential miRNA expression among non-tumorous, para-tumorous and tumorous tissues was analyzed. Moreover, luciferase activities of SIRT3 3'UTR treated with miR-494 were determined. Then human hepatoma cell lines were dealt with mimics or inhibitors of miR-494, migration and proliferation ability were assessed. The expression of SIRT3 and markers of mesenchymal cell were analyzed. The influences of miR-494 on development of HCC through inducing EndMT by targeting SIRT3 and TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathways in hepatoma cell lines were investigated. Xenograft mice were used to explore the potential roles of miR-494 on EndMT and development of HCC in vivo. Our results showed that, compared with non-tumorous tissues, 17 miRNAs were upregulated and 3 miRNAs were down-regulated in tumor tissues. In tumor tissues, the miR-494 expression level was much more than the expression of para-tumorous and non-tumorous tissues. MiR-494 suppressed SIRT3 expression, additionally enhanced expression of mesenchymal cell markers, while exerted effects on cell proliferation and migration of hepatoma cell lines. Moreover, the antagomir of miR-494 could protect against development process in xenogarft murine model. In conclusions, our work demonstrated that miR-494 targeted to SIRT3, and was a crucial mediator of EndMT and development of HCC through regulating SIRT3/TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway. It suggested that aim at SIRT3/TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway through suppressing the miR-494 expression level, was a feasible therapy strategy for HCC.

The impact of somatic SMAD4 mutations in colorectal liver metastases.||||||||Recent advances in cancer genomics have led to the identification of many molecular pathways involved in colorectal cancer (CRC) carcinogenesis. Pre-clinical and clinical data have shown that gene mutations involved in several of these pathways have an important prognostic impact, particularly on the outcomes of patients with metastatic CRC. Therefore, specific information on such gene mutational status can be potentially used as biomarkers to guide genome-oriented personalized treatment and ultimately improve patient outcomes. Drosophila protein, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4) has a critical intermediate role in the TGFβ signaling pathway. Loss of SMAD4 expression is associated with both metastatic development and worse response to chemotherapy for patients with CRC. Additionally, it has been reported that the loss of SMAD4 function is independently associated with decreased recurrencefree (RFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with CRC, especially for patients with advanced stages of disease. Furthermore, among patients who undergo hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), SMAD4 mutations are associated with a high likelihood of simultaneously carrying RAS mutations, which independently predict worse OS. Although recent evidence highlights the prognostic importance of somatic SMAD4 mutations in CRLM, ongoing research is necessary to untangle the specific molecular mechanisms involved in the complex SMAD4 regulatory network as well as the synergism with other mutations implicated in the pathogenesis of CRC. The detailed elucidation of such mechanisms may potentially aid the development of future trials in establishing novel, targeted therapeutic advances to further guide clinical decision-making for patients with CRC.

The aim of this study is to determine the association between circulating cathepsin D levels and clinical outcomes in patients with HF and to investigate the biological settings that induce the release of cathepsin D in HF.||||Cathepsin D levels were studied in 2174 patients with HF from the BIOSTAT-CHF index study. Results were validated in 1700 HF patients from the BIOSTAT-CHF validation cohort. The primary combined outcome was all-cause mortality and/or HF hospitalizations. Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes were subjected to hypoxic, pro-inflammatory signalling and stretch conditions. Additionally, cathepsin D expression was inhibited by targeted short hairpin RNAs (shRNA). Higher levels of cathepsin D were independently associated with diabetes mellitus, renal failure and higher levels of interleukin-6 and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (P < 0.001 for all). Cathepsin D levels were independently associated with the primary combined outcome [hazard ratio (HR) per standard deviation (SD): 1.12; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.23], which was validated in an independent cohort (HR per SD: 1.23, 95% CI 1.09-1.40). In vitro experiments demonstrated that human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes released cathepsin D and troponin T in response to mechanical stretch. ShRNA-mediated silencing of cathepsin D resulted in increased necrosis, abrogated autophagy, increased stress-induced metabolism, and increased release of troponin T from human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes under stress.||||Circulating cathepsin D levels are associated with HF severity and poorer outcome, and reduced levels of cathepsin D may have detrimental effects with therapeutic potential in HF.

The role of SIRT1 in skeletal muscle function and repair of older mice.||||||||Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a NAD+ sensitive deacetylase that has been linked to longevity and has been suggested to confer beneficial effects that counter aging-associated deterioration. Muscle repair is dependent upon satellite cell function, which is reported to be reduced with aging; however, it is not known if this is linked to an aging-suppression of SIRT1. This study tested the hypothesis that Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) overexpression would increase the extent of muscle repair and muscle function in older mice.||||We examined satellite cell dependent repair in tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles of 13 young wild-type mice (20-30 weeks) and 49 older (80+ weeks) mice that were controls (n = 13), overexpressed SIRT1 in skeletal muscle (n = 14), and had a skeletal muscle SIRT1 knockout (n = 12) or a satellite cell SIRT1 knockout (n = 10). Acute muscle injury was induced by injection of cardiotoxin (CTX), and phosphate-buffered saline was used as a vector control. Plantarflexor muscle force and fatigue were evaluated before or 21 days after CTX injection. Satellite cell proliferation and mitochondrial function were also evaluated in undamaged muscles.||||Maximal muscle force was significantly lower in control muscles of older satellite cell knockout SIRT1 mice compared to young adult wild-type (YWT) mice (P < 0.001). Mean contraction force at 40 Hz stimulation was significantly greater after recovery from CTX injury in older mice that overexpressed muscle SIRT1 than age-matched SIRT1 knockout mice (P < 0.05). SIRT1 muscle knockout models (P < 0.05) had greater levels of p53 (P < 0.05 MKO, P < 0.001 OE) in CTX-damaged tissues as compared to YWT CTX mice. SIRT1 overexpression with co-expression of p53 was associated with increased fatigue resistance and increased force potentiation during repeated contractions as compared to wild-type or SIRT1 knockout models (P < 0.001). Muscle structure and mitochondrial function were not different between the groups, but proliferation of satellite cells was significantly greater in older mice with SIRT1 muscle knockout (P < 0.05), but not older SIRT1 satellite cell knockout models, in vitro, although this effect was attenuated in vivo after 21 days of recovery.||||The data suggest skeletal muscle structure, function, and recovery after CTX-induced injury are not significantly influenced by gain or loss of SIRT1 abundance alone in skeletal muscle; however, muscle function is impaired by ablation of SIRT1 in satellite cells. SIRT1 appears to interact with p53 to improve muscle fatigue resistance after repair from muscle injury.

[Serine hydroxymethyl transferase 2 regulates the AMPK/mTOR pathway and induces autophagy to promote chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer cells].||||||||Objective To investigate the mechanism of serine hydroxymethyl transferase 2 (SHMT2) inducing autophagy and promoting chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer cells. Methods TCGA database and real-time quantitative PCR were used to analyze the level of SHMT2 mRNA in colon cancer tissues. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression and distribution of SHMT2 in colon cancer tissues. Western blot analysis was performed to detect the SHMT2 protein levels of SW480, SW620, HCT116, CACO2, RKO, HCT8, HT15 and HT29 cells. After over-expression of SHMT2 in CACO2 colon cancer cells, MTT assay was used to detect cell viability, and annexin V-FITC/PI double labeling was used to detect the apoptosis of colon cancer cells induced by 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu). The autophagosomes of colon cancer cells were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The protein levels of LC3 II/I, P62, cleaved PARP (c-PARP), and cleaved caspase-3 (c-caspase-3) were examined by Western blot analysis. Signaling Phospho-Antibody Array and Western blot analysis were applied to analyze the phosphorylation level of AMPK/mTOR. Results SHMT2 was highly expressed in colon cancer tissues and cells. Over-expression of SHMT2 significantly increased cell viability and the ratio of LC3 II/ LC3 I. It was found that the phosphorylation level of AMPK was raised and the phosphorylation level of mTOR was reduced after the over-expression of SHMT2. Conclusion SHMT2 may induce autophagy by promoting AMPK phosphorylation and directly or indirectly inhibiting mTOR activity, thus leading to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis tolerance and resistance to chemotherapeutics.

Bone-Forming and Antiresorptive Effects of Romosozumab in Postmenopausal Women With Osteoporosis: Bone Histomorphometry and Microcomputed Tomography Analysis After 2 and 12 Months of Treatment.||||||||Sclerostin, a protein produced by osteocytes, inhibits bone formation. Administration of sclerostin antibody results in increased bone formation in multiple animal models. Romosozumab, a humanized sclerostin antibody, has a dual effect on bone, transiently increasing serum biochemical markers of bone formation and decreasing serum markers of bone resorption, leading to increased BMD and reduction in fracture risk in humans. We aimed to evaluate the effects of romosozumab on bone tissue. In a subset of 107 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in the multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Fracture Study in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis (FRAME), transiliac bone biopsies were performed either after 2 (n = 34) or 12 (n = 73) months of treatment with 210 mg once monthly of romosozumab or placebo to evaluate histomorphometry and microcomputed tomography-based microarchitectural endpoints. After 2 months, compared with either baseline values assessed after a quadruple fluorochrome labeling or placebo, significant increases (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001) in dynamic parameters of formation (median MS/BS: romosozumab 1.51% and 5.64%; placebo 1.60% and 2.31% at baseline and month 2, respectively) were associated with a significant decrease compared with placebo in parameters of resorption in cancellous (median ES/BS: placebo 3.4%, romosozumab 1.8%; P = 0.022) and endocortical (median ES/BS: placebo 6.3%, romosozumab 1.6%; P = 0.003) bone. At 12 months, cancellous bone formation was significantly lower (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001) in romosozumab versus placebo and the lower values for resorption endpoints seen at month 2 persisted (P < 0.001), signaling a decrease in bone turnover (P = 0.006). No significant change was observed in periosteal and endocortical bone. This resulted in an increase in bone mass and trabecular thickness with improved trabecular connectivity, without significant modification of cortical porosity at month 12. In conclusion, romosozumab produced an early and transient increase in bone formation, but a persistent decrease in bone resorption. Antiresorptive action eventually resulted in decreased bone turnover. This effect resulted in significant increases in bone mass and improved microarchitecture. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Identification of Nogo-B as a new molecular target of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.||||||||Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a fast-growing chronic liver disease worldwide which can lead to liver cirrhosis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a ligand-activated transcription factor, plays an important role in lipogenesis. Increased Nogo-B expression can be determined in the liver of cirrhosis patients. However, the effect of PPARγ activation on hepatic Nogo-B expression remains unknown. In this study, we found PPARγ activation by rosiglitazone or dephosphorylation increased Nogo-B expression at mRNA and protein levels in HepG2 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, we identified a PPARγ response element (PPRE) in Nogo-B promoter and found PPARγ enhanced Nogo-B transcription in a PPRE-dependent manner. ChIP assay further confirms rosiglitazone enhanced the binding of PPARγ to Nogo-B promoter. Using a liver specific PPARγ deficient mice, we determined the critical role of PPARγ expression in regulating hepatic Nogo-B expression. Increased glucose and palmitate in culture medium activated Nogo-B and PPARγ expression in mouse primary hepatocytes, and corresponding, high-fat diet (HFD) induced fatty liver associated with increased hepatic Nogo-B and PPARγ expression in mice. Similarly, serum Nogo-B levels in patients with NAFLD were increased. However, rosiglitazone treatment reduced HFD-induced fatty liver and Nogo-B expression. In summary, our study identifies Nogo-B as a new molecular target of PPARγ, and suggests increased Nogo-B might be a potential indicator for NAFLD.

Gain of function in somatic TP53 mutations is associated with immune-rich breast tumors and changes in tumor-associated macrophages.||||||||Somatic mutations in TP53 are present in 20%-30% of all breast tumors. While there are numerous population-based analyses of TP53, yet none have examined the relationship between somatic mutations in TP53 and tumor invasive immune cells.||||Clinical and genetic data from 601 women drawn from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used to test the association between somatic TP53 mutation and immune-rich or immune-poor tumor status; determined using the CIBERSORT-based gene expression signature of 22 immune cell types. Our validation dataset, the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC), used a pathologist-determined measure of lymphocyte infiltration.||||Within TP53-mutated samples, a mutation at codon p.R175H was shown to be present at higher frequency in immune-rich tumors. In validation analysis, any somatic mutation in TP53 was associated with immune-rich status, and the mutation at p.R175H had a significant association with tumor-invasive lymphocytes. TCGA-only analysis of invasive immune cell type identified an increase in M0 macrophages associated with p.R175H.||||These findings suggest that TP53 somatic mutations, particularly at codon p.R175H, are enriched in tumors with infiltrating immune cells. Our results confirm recent research showing inflammation-related gain of function in specific TP53 mutations.

Effect of RNA splicing machinery gene mutations on prognosis of patients with MDS: A meta-analysis.||||||||Gene mutations with important prognostic role have been identified in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the effects of RNA splicing machinery gene mutations on prognosis of MDS patients.||||We searched English database including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library for literatures published within recent 10 years on the effect of RNA splicing machinery genes in MDS. Revman version 5.2 software was used for all the statistical processing. We calculated risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) of continuous variables, and find hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI of time-to-event data.||||We included 19 studies enrolling 4320 patients. There is a significant superior overall survival (OS) in splicing factor 3b, subunit 1 (SF3B1)-mutation group compared to unmutated group (HR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.5-0.67, P < .00001); OS decreased significantly in serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2/ U2 auxiliary factor protein 1 (SRSF2/U2AF1) mutation group compared to unmutated group, (HR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.34-1.97, P < .00001 and HR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.9, P < .00001, respectively). In terms of leukemia-free survival (LFS), the group with SF3B1 mutation had better outcome than unmutated group, HR = 0.63 (95% CI: 0.53-0.75, P < .00001). Other RNA splicing gene mutation group showed significant poor LFS than unmutated groups, (HR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.6-2.23, P < .00001; HR = 2.77, 95% CI: 2.24-3.44, P < .00001; HR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.08-2.03, P < .00001; for SRSF2, U2AF1, and zinc finger CCCH-type, RNA binding motif and serine/arginine rich 2 [ZRSR2], respectively). As for subgroup of low- or intermediate-1-IPSS risk MDS, SRSF2, and U2AF1 mutations were related to poor OS. (HR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.43-2.35, P < .00001; HR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.59-2.79, P < .00001 for SRSF2 and U2AF1, respectively). SRSF2 and U2AF1 mutations were strongly associated with male patients. SF3B1 mutation was strongly associated with disease staging.||||This meta-analysis indicates a positive effect of SF3B1 and an adverse prognostic effect of SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2 mutations in patients with MDS.

FENDRR expression in lung tissues from patients with IPF and mice with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Iron-responsive element-binding protein 1 (IRP1), a protein partner of FENDDR, was identified by RNA pulldown-coupled mass spectrometry analysis and confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation. The interaction region between FENDRR and IRP1 was determined by cross-linking immunoprecipitation. The in vivo role of FENDRR in pulmonary fibrosis was studied using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in mice.||||The expression of FENDRR was down-regulated in fibrotic human and mouse lungs as well as primary lung fibroblasts isolated from bleomycin-treated mice. TGFβ1-SMAD3 signaling inhibited FENDRR expression in lung fibroblasts. FENDRR was preferentially localized in the cytoplasm of adult lung fibroblasts and bound IRP1, suggesting its role in iron metabolism. FENDRR reduced pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting fibroblast activation by reducing iron level and acting as a competing endogenous RNA of the profibrotic miR-214. Adenovirus-mediated FENDRR gene transfer in the mouse lung attenuated bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and improved lung function.||||Our data suggest that FENDRR is an anti-fibrotic lncRNA and a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis.

Analysis in the thalamus revealed HCN4 mRNA in VGlut2-positive excitatory neurons that was always co-expressed with HCN2 mRNA. In contrast, HCN4 mRNA was undetectable in the nucleus reticularis. HCN4 mRNA expression was high in a subset of VGat-positive cells in the globus pallidus external. The majority of these neurons co-expressed HCN2 mRNA while a smaller subset also co-expressed HCN1 mRNA. In the striatum, a small subset of large cells which are likely to be giant cholinergic interneurons co-expressed high levels of HCN4 and HCN2 mRNA. The amygdala, cortex and hippocampus expressed low levels of HCN4 mRNA. This study highlights the heterogeneity of HCN4 mRNA expression in the brain and provides a morphological framework on which to better investigate the functional roles of HCN4 channels.

FGF21 was not released from scAT, neither before nor after weight loss in agreement with an undetectable gene expression of FGF21 in this tissue. Although scAT showed significant gene expression of FAP, no release of FAP from the tissue could be detected. The high fat meal increased postprandial circulating FGF21 but not FAP. Circulating levels of FAP but not FGF21 were significantly reduced after weight loss. On the other hand, FAP expression in scAT was increased.

Low-protein diet enhances adiponectin secretion in rats.||||||||Previous studies including ours have shown that a low-protein diet up-regulates insulin signaling in the liver and muscle and induces fatty liver in rats. Adiponectin is known as an insulin-sensitizing adipocytokine. We, therefore, examined the effect of a low-protein diet on the adiponectin levels in rats. The low-protein diet significantly increased serum adiponectin level. However, mRNA and protein levels of adiponectin in white adipose tissue (WAT) were not changed by the low-protein diet. Since it is known that oligomerization is important to control serum adiponectin level, we examined the population of adiponectin oligomeric forms in WAT and found that low-protein diet did not change it. Despite these events, the amount of its secretion was significantly increased in the adipocytes isolated from WAT of low-protein diet-fed rats. These results indicate that a low-protein diet enhances adiponectin secretion, which is not due to the increased intracellular amount and oligomerization of adiponectin.

Analysis of VEGF gene polymorphisms and serum VEGF protein levels contribution in polycystic ovary syndrome of patients.||||||||Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a well-known factor in reproductive function and contributes to the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Genetic variations in VEGFA gene were suggested to contribute alterations in VEGF secretion and PCOS. This study evaluated the association of VEGFA SNPs with altered VEGF secretion level and PCOS among ethnically-matched control women. This prospective case-control study was conducted from 2016 to 2018 and comprised of 55 women with PCOS and 52 control subjects. ELISA was used to measure VEGF levels; and various other related bio chemicals whereas the genotyping of VEGFA variants was performed through the analysis of nine SNPs of VEGF. PRL, E2, PRGE testosterone and glucose level were found to be insignificantly different. The levels of FSH, LH, LH/FSH, TT, insulin, SHBG and HOMA-IR were significantly higher in the study group. Among the nine tested variants of VEGF SNPs, two SNPs rs3025020 and rs833061, consisted of TT (Recessive and Dominant homozygous, respectively) which were marginally higher in test. The SNP rs1570360 had significantly higher GG allele (32.73%) which was recessive homozygous. There was no significant difference observed in genotype frequencies related to higher value of VEGF. The genotype frequencies for the studied SNPs were in alignment with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The mean serum VEGF levels got significantly increased in PCOS group. No significant association was found between VEGF genotypes and its serum levels. VEGF levels in rs699947 (AA-major homozygous), rs3025039 (CC-major homozygous) and rs833061 (TT & CC-major & minor homozygous) genotypes were significantly higher in PCOS. The study results evidently proved that the allelic variants in genes may be a factor for PCOS and VEGF serum levels with respect to few SNP variants only. These findings indicated that VEGF may be involved in PCOS status and confirmed the previous association between genetic variants in VEGF, serum level of VEGF protein and PCOS.

The rete testis harbors Sertoli-like cells capable of expressing Dmrt1.||||||||Sertoli cells (SCs), supporting cells in the mammalian testis, proliferate throughout fetal and postnatal development but exit the cell cycle and differentiate at puberty. In our previous study, we isolated a population of highly proliferative Sertoli-like cells (SLCs) from the region of the adult mouse testis containing the rete testis and adjacent seminiferous tubules. Here RNA-seq of the adult SLC culture as well as qPCR analysis and immunofluorescence of the adult and immature (6 dpp) SLC cultures were performed that allowed us to identify SLC-specific genes, including Pax8, Cdh1, and Krt8. Using these, we found that SLCs are mostly localized in the rete testis epithelium; however, some contribution of transitional zones of seminiferous tubules could not be excluded. The main feature of SLCs indicating their relationship to SCs is DMRT1 expression. More than 40% of both adult and immature SLCs expressed DMRT1 at different levels in culture. Only rare DMRT1+ cells were detected in the adult rete testis, whereas more than 40% of cells were positively stained for DMRT1 in the immature rete testis. One more SC protein, AMH, was found in some rete cells of the immature testis. It was also demonstrated that SLCs expressed such SC genes as Nr5a1, Dhh, Gdnf, and Kitl and interacted with germ cells in 3D co-culture with immature testicular cells. All these similarities between SLCs and rete cells on one hand and SCs on the other suggest that rete cells could share a common origin with SCs.

The CCR7 AUC for diagnosis of locally advanced NC was 0.837 and for prediction of mortality was 0.759. Univariate analysis revealed significant differences in smoking history, long-term consumption of pickled food, family history of NC, primary lesion staging, lymph node staging, distant metastasis, clinical pathological staging, and CCR7 between the two groups (P < 0.05).||||CCR7 was valuable in the diagnosis of locally advanced NC, and highly expressed CCR7 was predictive of poor prognosis.

Effects of oral monosodium glutamate administration on serum metabolomics of suckling piglets.|||||||| H NMR-based metabolomics' study found that the addition of monosodium glutamate (MSG) significantly reduced serum citrate content in 7-day-old piglets, while HMG significantly increased serum trimethylamine content and significantly reduced unsaturated fat content in 7-day-old piglets (p < .05). The content of glutamine, trimethylamine, albumin, choline and urea nitrogen was significantly increased and the creatinine content decreased significantly in the 21-day-old HMG (p < .05). Analysis of serum hormones revealed that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) content in the 21-day-old HMG was highest (p < .05). The cholecystokinin (CCK) content in the HMG of 7-day-old piglets was lower than that in the LMG (p < .05), and the CCK content in the serum of the 21-day-old MMG was highest (p < .05). The serum leptin levels in the 21-day-old HMG were the lowest (p < .05). The serum insulin content in the 7-day-old MMG was highest (p < .05). This study suggests that MSG plays an important role in the metabolism of sugar, fat and protein (amino acids). These results provide a theoretical basis for designing piglet feed formulations.

As such, it affects RBC morphology, membrane deformability, nanostructure, stiffness, and, ultimately, the rheological properties of blood. However, little is known about how temperature affects the spectrin matrix. In this study, the nanostructure of the spectrin network was recorded by atomic force microscopy. We describe how the nanostructure of the RBC spectrin matrix changes from a regular network to a chaotic pattern following an increase in temperature from 20 to 50°C. At 20-37°С, the spectrin network formed a regular structure with dimensions of typically 150 ± 60 nm. At 42-43°С, 83% of the spectrin network assumed an irregular structure. Finally, at 49-50°С the chaotic pattern was observed, and no quantitative estimates of the spectrin structure's parameters could be made. These results can be useful for biophysical studies on the destruction of the spectrin network under pathological conditions, as well as for investigating cell morphology and blood rheology in different diseases.

Osteoglycin and Bone-a Systematic Review.||||||||Bone turnover is a regulated process. Osteoglycin is suggested to have an important impact on bone function but may also affect cardiovascular and metabolic functions. This review investigates the action of osteoglycin in bone as well as its potential endocrine effects.||||Osteoglycin is expressed by several tissues including bone and muscle. Some studies suggest that osteoglycin increases osteoblast differentiation whereas others suggest that osteoglycin decreases osteoblast differentiation. Thus, findings on the influence of osteoglycin in bone are conflicting. A recent study found increased bone mass in osteoglycin deficient mice. Another study reported that osteoglycin is a marker of low bone mineral density and vertebral fractures in women with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, clinical studies link osteoglycin to insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. Osteoglycin may be a novel marker of a muscle, pancreatic, and bone axis. However, current evidence is limited and further research investigating osteoglycin in both a pre-clinical and a clinical setting is needed.

Transmembrane protease serine 5: a novel Schwann cell plasma marker for CMT1A.||||||||Development of biomarkers for Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is critical for implementing effective clinical trials. The most common form of CMT, type 1A, is caused by a genomic duplication surrounding the PMP22 gene. A recent report (Neurology 2018;90:e518-3524) showed elevation of neurofilament light (NfL) in plasma of CMT1A disease patients, which correlated with disease severity. However, no plasma/serum biomarker has been identified that is specific to Schwann cells, the most directly affected cells in CMT1A.||||We used the Olink immuno PCR platform to profile CMT1A patient (n = 47, 2 cohorts) and normal control plasma (n = 41, two cohorts) on five different Olink panels to screen 398 unique proteins.||||The TMPRSS5 protein (Transmembrane protease serine 5) was elevated 2.07-fold (P = <0.0001) in two independent cohorts of CMT1A samples relative to controls. TMPRSS5 is most highly expressed in Schwann cells of peripheral nerve. Consistent with early myelination deficits in CMT1A, TMPRSS5 was not significantly correlated with disease score (CMTES-R, CMTNS-R), nerve conduction velocities (Ulnar CMAP, Ulnar MNCV), or with age. TMPRSS5 was not significantly elevated in smaller sample sets from patients with CMT2A, CMT2E, CMT1B, or CMT1X. The Olink immuno PCR assays confirmed elevated levels of NfL (average 1.58-fold, P < 0.0001), which correlated with CMT1A patient disease score.||||These data identify the first Schwann cell-specific protein that is elevated in plasma of CMT1A patients, and may provide a disease marker and a potentially treatment-responsive biomarker with good disease specificity for clinical trials.

Identification of miRNAs from stem cell derived microparticles in umbilical cord blood.||||||||Umbilical cord blood CD34+ (UCB-CD34+) stem cells are clinically used in hematopoietic cell transplantation. However, there are limitations in the use of umbilical cord blood transplants because of the small number of cells and delayed engraftment. To gain a better understanding of functional components of UCB, we have detected and characterized CD34+ microparticles (CD34+MPs) from cord blood units. We collected cord blood units and assessed the numbers of CD34+MPs before and after red blood cell and plasma depletion by SEPAX processing using flow cytometry analysis. In parallel we identified MPs by electron microscopy. CD34+MPs and cells were isolated by MACs sorting. MicroRNAs (miR-106, miR-221, miR-517, miR-519, and miR-221) exhibited a characteristic microRNA profile that was further validated in isolated CD34+MPs. We found that in cord blood, there are CD34+MPs that carry microRNAs.

The impact of serum protein binding on bacterial killing of minocycline.||||||||Minocycline is increasingly used clinically for treating infections due to multidrug resistant bacteria. We previously reported that the serum protein binding of minocycline atypically correlated with total concentration using microdialysis, but the therapeutic implications of this finding remained unclear. The objective of this study was to ascertain the functional impact of serum protein binding on bacterial killing.||||Time-kill experiments using 4 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii were conducted comparing the activity of minocycline in mouse serum (50 mg/L) and 50% cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (CA-MHB) (4 mg/L). As a control, similar experiments were also conducted for a clinically achievable levofloxacin concentration (4 mg/L) in serum and 50% CA-MHB (2 mg/L). Serial samples were collected in duplicate over 6 hours, and bacterial burden was determined by quantitative culture.||||Minocycline exhibited concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against the reference strain in mouse and human serum. Despite using approximately 10× the peak concentration associated with clinical dosing, only moderate bacterial killing was observed. All the minocycline killing profiles in serum were inferior to those observed in CA-MHB. In contrast, the reduction in bactericidal activity seen with levofloxacin was less dramatic.||||Antimicrobial activity of minocycline was dramatically reduced in the presence of serum, which corroborated with our atypical serum protein binding findings. If validated, these results implied dose escalation might not the best approach to improve the clinical efficacy of minocycline for bacteremia. Future investigations will focus on the specificity and mechanism(s) of minocycline protein binding.

Statistical analysis was performed by t-test and p< 0.05 was considered significant. All TSPs increased their own expression. TSP-1 and TSP-2 increased production of ANGPTL-4 and PDGF-BB. TSP-1 increased exclusively TGF-BETA1 and CD44 production. TSP-2 increased TSP-1 expression. All TSPs decreased IL-8. The findings suggest that TSP-1 and TSP-2 may promote vascular remodeling, in part, by increasing ANGPTL-4, PDGF-BB and their own expression. TSP-5 did not upregulate the inflammatory mediators TSP-1, PDGF-BB or TGF-BETA1, but upregulated its own expression, which could be a protective mechanism against the response to vascular injury.

Functions of estrogen and estrogen receptor signaling on skeletal muscle.||||||||Activity of estrogen, a sex steroid hormone, is not only limited to the reproductive organs but also involves other organs and tissues, including skeletal muscle. In postmenopausal women, estrogen decline causes endocrine and metabolic dysfunction, leading to a predisposition to osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, and decreased muscle mass and strength. The decline in skeletal muscle mass often associates with sarcopenia, a popular condition observed in fragile elder people. In addition, varying estrogen levels associated with the menstrual phases may modulate exercise performance in women. Estrogen is thus considered to play a crucial role in skeletal muscle homeostasis and exercise capacity, although its precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this article, we review the role of estrogen in the skeletal muscle, outlining the proposed molecular mechanisms. We especially focus on the current understanding of estrogen actions on mitochondria metabolism in skeletal muscle.

Aiming at a more acceptable therapy, we developed lipid-core nanocapsules (LNCs) entrapping the potent antileishmanial chalcone (CH8) for topical application. Rhodamine-labeled LNC (Rho-LNC-CH8) was produced for imaging studies. LNC-CH8 and Rho-LNC-CH8 had narrow size distributions (polydispersity index <0.10), with similar mean sizes (~180 nm) by dynamic light scattering. In vitro, Rho-LNC-CH8 was rapidly internalized by extracellular Leishmania amazonensis parasites macrophages in less than 15 min. LNC-CH8 activated macrophage oxidative mechanisms more efficiently than CH8, and was more selectively toxic against the intracellular parasites. In vivo, topically applied Rho-LNC-CH8 efficiently permeated mouse skin. In L. amazonensis-infected mice, LNC-CH8 reduced the parasite load by 86% after three weeks of daily topical treatment, while free CH8 was ineffective. In conclusion, LNC-CH8 has strong potential as a novel topical formulation for CL treatment.

The role of connexin43 in neuropathic pain induced by spinal cord injury.||||||||Neuropathic pain is caused by the damage or dysfunction of the nervous system. In many neuropathic pain models, there is an increase in the number of gap junction (GJ) channels, especially the upregulation of the expression of connexin43 (Cx43), leading to the secretion of various types of cytokines and involvement in the formation of neuropathic pain. GJs are widely distributed in mammalian organs and tissues, and Cx43 is the most abundant connexin (Cx) in mammals. Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell type in the central nervous system (CNS), which mainly express Cx43. More importantly, GJs play an important role in regulating cell metabolism, signaling, and function. Many existing literatures showed that Cx43 plays an important role in the nervous system, especially in the CNS under normal and pathological conditions. However, many internal mechanisms have not yet been thoroughly explored. In this review, we summarized the current understanding of the role and association of Cx and pannexin channels in neuropathic pain, especially after spinal cord injury, as well as some of our own insights and thoughts which suggest that Cx43 may become an emerging therapeutic target for future neuropathic pain, bringing new hope to patients.

The Molecular Mechanism of EPO Regulates the Angiogenesis after Cerebral Ischemia through AMPK-KLF2 Signaling Pathway.||||||||In this study, the molecular mechanism by which EPO regulates the angiogenesis after cerebral ischemia through AMPK-KLF2 signaling pathway was investigated.||||Sixty healthy, male, C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups of 20 mice: a sham group, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group, and a MCAO+EPO treatment group. The MCAO model was established using a modified ZeaLonga method. Mice in the EPO treatment group were injected with EPO immediately after reperfusion (5000 IU/kg), and EPO was injected the following day. The number of mouse deaths and neurologic function scores were recorded during the experiment. On day 7 after cerebral ischemia, brain tissue proteins were extracted. The following proteins expressions were detected by western blot assay: EPO, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGE), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (KDR), adenosine activated protein kinase (AMPK), and alpha HIF-1α alpha (HIF-1α), KLF2 and nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).||||Compared with the MCAO group, the survival rate of mice in the EPO group was significantly improved and neurological function was significantly improved (P < 0.01). Western blot results showed that the content of EPO in brain tissue in MCAO group significantly increased compared with sham group. The content of EPO in the brain tissue of mice in the MCAO+EPO treatment group was significantly higher than in that of the MCAO group, which indicates that EPO increased the content of EPO in mouse brain tissue. Compared with the sham group, the protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGE) and its receptor (KDR) in brain tissue of the MCAO group significantly decreased. However, the protein expression of VEGE and its receptor KDR in brain tissue of rats treated with MCAO+EPO was significantly higher than in that of the MCAO group. Thus, in this study, EPO was associated with vascular endothelial differentiation after cerebral ischemia in mice. The results of AMPK and KLF2 showed that the expression levels of AMPK and KLF2 in brain tissues of MCAO group mice significantly decreased compared with the sham group. However, the expression levels of AMPK and KLF2 in brain tissues of mice treated with MCAO+EPO were significantly higher than those in the MCAO group. Thus, EPO can activate AMPK and upregulate the expression of the transcription factor KLF2. The protein expression of HIF-1α in the brain tissue of mice in the MCAO group significantly increased compared with the sham group. However, the expression of HIF-1α in mice brain tissues in the MCAO+EPO treatment group was significantly lower than in that of the MCAO group, indicating that EPO was involved in regulating HIF-1α expression. The eNOS results showed that, compared with Sham group, the protein expression of eNOS in brain tissue of MCAO group mice significantly decreased. In the MCAO+EPO treatment group, the protein expression of eNOS was significantly higher in the brain tissue of the mice than in that of the MCAO group, indicating that EPO was involved in the synthesis of NO and promoted the angiogenesis.||||EPO promotes VEGE and its receptor (KDR) expression and participates in the regulation of HIF-1α and eNOS protein expression through the activation of AMPK-KLF2 signaling pathways to promote new vascular development after cerebral ischemia.

Mammary tissue vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) levels were determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The tissue VEGF levels were lower in group IV compared with DMBA group. Decreased M-CSF levels were observed in all therapeutic groups rather than the DMBA group, but the most effective decrease was found in group IV. Compared with the DMBA group, MMP-9 levels were statistically significantly decreased in group II and group IV. However, TIMP-1 levels were higher in the whole therapeutic groups rather than the DMBA group and the most effective increase was observed in group IV. Results of the present study suggest that combined therapy of RAL with FLX might lead to a better outcome targeting breast tumor.

Circulating tumor cells in pulmonary vein and peripheral arterial provide a metric for PD-L1 diagnosis and prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer.||||||||Lung cancer is the leading cause of death caused by malignant tumors. PD-L1(programmed cell death protein-1) has shown tremendous achievement in treating NSCLC. We sought to find the relationship between CTCs in the pulmonary vein and postoperative PFS, besides we detected PD-L1 in CTCs.||||We enrolled 112 NSCLC patients. CTC tests were performed at four time points (preoperative, pulmonary vein, intraoperative and postoperative) on every NSCLC patient who received surgery. The RNA of PD-L1 was tested by FISH. The levels of the PD-L1 mRNA and protein in tissue samples were detected.||||The CTCs in the PV were the highest (P< 0.001), and CTCs in the PPA were the lowest (P< 0.001). The PFS in the group with PV CTCs≥ 16/5 ml was shorter than that in the group with PV CTCs< 16/5 ml (11.1 months vs 21.2 months, respectively; P< 0.001). The PFS in the group with PPA CTCs≥ 3/5 ml was shorter than that in the group with CTCs< 3/5 ml (14.8 months vs 20.7 months, respectively; P< 0.001). The CTCs in stage I were lower than those in stage II-IV (P = 0.025). No linear relationship was found between the CTCs and tumor size (P> 0.05) or LN metastasis (P> 0.05). In total, fifty-two (50.5%) patients had positive PD-L1 expression in CTC. In PD-L1-positive CTC patients, the value of PD-L1 tissue expression was higher than that in PD-L1-negative CTC patients (P = 0.0153).||||CTCs in the pulmonary vein can be an effective prognosis indicator of NSCLC patients.

Intensive weight gain therapy in patients with anorexia nervosa results in improved serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) 5a and 5b isoform protein levels.||||||||Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) exists as isoforms 5a and 5b. TRAP 5a is a biomarker of chronic inflammation and influences adipose tissue and 5b associates with bone metabolism/pathologies. The aim was to investigate the association of serum TRAP 5a/5b isoforms with fat and bone markers and anthropometric parameters in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) during weight gain therapy.||||Twenty-five Swedish female AN patients, age 16-24 years, were treated for 12 weeks with a high-energy diet with six meals daily. Serum TRAP 5a/5b, markers of fat/glucose metabolism, markers of bone resorption and formation were measured. Parameters of bone and body composition were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and peripheral quantitative computed tomography.||||, p < 0.0001. TRAP 5a and 5a/5b ratio increased but TRAP 5b decreased during the study. TRAP Δ5a and Δ5b correlated with Δinsulin and Δadiponectin, respectively. TRAP 5b correlated with trabecular density at start but not at week 12. At 12 weeks, TRAP 5b correlated with CTX, and Δ decrease in TRAP 5b correlated to Δ increase in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase.||||This clinical interventional study resulted in increased BMI in patients with AN. The decreased TRAP 5b protein levels confirm a role for TRAP 5b as a marker of bone resorption, whereas increased TRAP 5a seemed to derive from systemic changes in bone as well as metabolic changes. The combined detection of TRAP 5a and TRAP 5b in serum could be an indicator of improved bone metabolism.||||Level III, prospective interventional cohort study.

Silencing SEC5 inhibits trophoblast invasion via integrin/Ca2+ signaling.||||||||The invasion of maternal decidua by extravillous trophoblast (EVT) is essential for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy, and abnormal trophoblast invasion could lead to placenta-associated pathologies including early pregnancy loss and preeclampsia. SEC5, a component of the exocyst complex, plays important roles in cell survival and migration, but its role in early pregnancy has not been reported. Thus, the present study was performed to explore the functions of SEC5 in trophoblast cells. The results showed that SEC5 expression in human placental villi at first trimester was significantly higher than it was at the third trimester, and it was abundently localized in the cytotrophoblast (CTB) and the trophoblastic column. SEC5 knockdown was accompanied by reduced migration and invasion in HTR-8/SVneo cells. In addition, the expression and plasma membrane distribution of integrin β1 was also decreased. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated knockdown of SEC5 inhibited the outgrowth of first trimester placental explants. SEC5 and InsP3R were colocalized in the cytoplasm of HTR-8/SVneo cells, and the cell-permeant calcium chelator BAPTA-AM could significantly inhibit HTR-8/SVneo cell invasion. The Ca2+ imaging results showed that the 10% fetal bovine serum-stimulated cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]c) was not only reduced by downregulated SEC5 but also was blocked by the InsP3R inhibitor. Furthermore, either the [Ca2+]c was buffered by BAPTA-AM or the knockdown of SEC5 disrupted HTR-8/SVneo cell F-actin stress fibers and caused cytoskeleton derangement. Taken together, our results suggest that SEC5 might be involved in regulating trophoblast cell migration and invasion through the integrin/Ca2+ signal pathway to induce cytoskeletal rearrangement.

SPARCL1 impedes trophoblast migration and invasion by down-regulating ERK phosphorylation and AP-1 production and altering EMT-related molecule expression.||||||||Embryo implantation depends on trophoblast cells migration and invasion. Abnormal function of trophoblast cells could result in many pregnancy complications. Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine like-1 (SPARCL1) has been reported to inhibit cell migration and tumor invasion. This study aimed to explore the role of SPARCL1 in trophoblast functions.||||Villous specimens were obtained from 31 women with spontaneous abortion and 31 women with normal early pregnancy to determine the expression of SPARCL1. HTR8/SVneo cells and JAR cells were transfected with pIRES2-EGFP-SPARCL1 vectors and control vectors. The proliferation assay and scratch-wound assay were performed. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting were performed to assess epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related molecules including MMP2, MMP3, N-cadherin, E-cadherin and vimentin. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation activity and AP-1 expression in HTR8/SVneo cells following multi-scratching were detected using above assays.||||The mRNA and protein levels of SPARCL1 were significantly higher in the abortion group than in the normal pregnancy group. After transfection, there was no difference of cell viability between the SPARCL1-overexpression group and control vector group. However, the migration distance and area were reduced and the abundances of EMT related molecules were changed by SPARCL1 overexpression when compared with controls. Lower ERK phosphorylation activity and decreased Fos and Jun expressions were noted at high level of SPARCL1.||||Restrained migration and invasion were noted in trophoblast cells with SPARCL1 overexpression, which might affect embryo implantation and placenta development. It could be involved in the pathogenesis of spontaneous abortion.

Loss of the serine protease HTRA1 impairs smooth muscle cells maturation.||||||||Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dysfunction is a hallmark of small vessel disease, a common cause of stroke and dementia. Two of the most frequently mutated genes in familial small vessel disease are HTRA1 and NOTCH3. The protease HTRA1 cleaves the NOTCH3 ligand JAG1 implying a mechanistic link between HTRA1 and Notch signaling. Here we report that HTRA1 is essential for VSMC differentiation into the contractile phenotype. Mechanistically, loss of HTRA1 increased JAG1 protein levels and NOTCH3 signaling activity in VSMC. In addition, the loss of HTRA1 enhanced TGFβ-SMAD2/3 signaling activity. Activation of either NOTCH3 or TGFβ signaling resulted in increased transcription of the HES and HEY transcriptional repressors and promoted the contractile VSMC phenotype. However, their combined over-activation led to an additive accumulation of HES and HEY proteins, which repressed the expression of contractile VSMC marker genes. As a result, VSMC adopted an immature phenotype with impaired arterial vasoconstriction in Htra1-deficient mice. These data demonstrate an essential role of HTRA1 in vascular maturation and homeostasis by controlling Notch and TGFβ signaling.

Arih2 gene influences immune response and tissue development in chicken.||||||||Ariadne homolog 2 (ARIH2), as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is one of the important factors involved in regulating biological functions, such as inflammation and skeletal muscle degeneration. In the present study, the full-length coding sequence of Arih2 gene was cloned from Hy-Line Brown chicken. The tissue transcriptional profiles of Arih2 gene at different developmental stages were detected using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and the Arih2 functional characteristics in immune response were analyzed. The results showed that the full-length coding sequence of Arih2 gene was 1473 bp, encoding 490 amino acids, and conservative between different species. The Arih2 gene was transcribed in various tissues at different developmental stages, and its transcriptional activities varied significantly between multiple tissues. With the development of chicken, Arih2 gene was basically up-regulated in heart, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle and glandular stomach, but fluctuated significantly in large intestine. In immune response, the transcriptional activities of Arih2 gene exhibited significant changes in the bursa, thymus and blood (P<0.05). The results showed that Arih2 might be a multifunctional gene involved in tissue development and immune response in chicken, and have a potential possible application as diagnostic marker for identifying immune response.

Caveolin-1 in skin aging - From innocent bystander to major contributor.||||||||Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) appears to be both a pathophysiological contributor and a target in different inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin conditions as well as in skin aging. Skin fibroblasts demonstrate an up-regulation of Cav-1 expression both in chronological and UV-induced aging, and such an up-regulation was observed both in vitro and in vivo. Typical alterations in aging skin involve a reduction of the dermis thickness, a significant expansion of the dermal white adipose tissue as well as modifications of the content and distribution of hyaluronan, impairment of autophagic flux, a reduction of collagen expression and an increase in tissue inflammation. All of these phenomena can be connected with changes in Cav-1 expression in the aging skin. Modified expression of Cav-1 can also significantly influence the mechanical properties of individual skin layers, thus changing the total mechanical stability of the layered composite skin/WAT, leading to typical structural modifications of the skin surface in the aging skin. Selective reduction of Cav-1 expression has the potential to exert anti-aging effects on the skin.

Preadipocyte factor 1 regulates adipose tissue browning via TNF-α-converting enzyme-mediated cleavage.||||||||Increasing adaptive thermogenesis in adipose tissue may be a potential therapeutic target for overcoming obesity and obesity-related disorders. Preadipocyte factor 1 (Pref-1), a preadipocyte secreted protein, plays an inhibitory role in adipogenic differentiation. However, the role of Pref-1 in adipose tissue browning remains unknown. We investigated whether Pref-1 regulates thermogenic program and beige fat biogenesis.||||Pref-1 expression levels were examined in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes in thermogenic conditions induced by cold exposure or a beta-adrenergic stimulus (CL316,243). Overexpression and knockdown studies were performed both in vivo and in vitro to clarify the role of Pref-1 in iWAT browning.||||Cold exposure or CL316,243 induced a thermogenic program in adipose tissue of C57BL/6N mice and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Notably, Pref-1 levels were down-regulated in iWAT and adipocytes under these conditions. Overexpressing Pref-1 showed reduced thermogenic gene expressions in response to CL316,243 treatment, whereas depletion of Pref-1 augmented thermogenic program in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Correspondingly, treating C57BL/6N mice with Pref-1 resulted in reduced expression of thermogenic and beige fat markers, a reduced rate of oxygen consumption, blunting of UCP1 expression and beige fat formation in iWAT in response to cold exposure or CL316,243 injection compared to the untreated mice. The opposite phenotype was observed in mice with inducible fat-specific knock-out of Pref-1. Mechanistically, these effects were regulated by modulation of TNF-α-converting enzyme activity and Pref-1 cleavage.||||Our findings establish a novel role of Pref-1 that regulates adaptive thermogenesis. This offers a unique target for improving energy homeostasis and treating obesity.

NURR1 activation in skeletal muscle controls systemic energy homeostasis.||||||||Skeletal muscle plays a central role in the control of metabolism and exercise tolerance. Analysis of muscle enhancers activated after exercise in mice revealed the orphan nuclear receptor NURR1/NR4A2 as a prominent component of exercise-responsive enhancers. We show that exercise enhances the expression of NURR1, and transgenic overexpression of NURR1 in skeletal muscle enhances physical performance in mice. NURR1 expression in skeletal muscle is also sufficient to prevent hyperglycemia and hepatic steatosis, by enhancing muscle glucose uptake and storage as glycogen. Furthermore, treatment of obese mice with putative NURR1 agonists increases energy expenditure, improves glucose tolerance, and confers a lean phenotype, mimicking the effects of exercise. These findings identify a key role for NURR1 in governance of skeletal muscle glucose metabolism, and reveal a transcriptional link between exercise and metabolism. Our findings also identify NURR1 agonists as possible exercise mimetics with the potential to ameliorate obesity and other metabolic abnormalities.

We found that functional loss of a DNA methylation machinery component, ubiquitin-like protein containing PHD and RING finger domains 1 (uhrf1), leads to reduced numbers of ectoderm-derived enteric neurons and severe disruption of mesoderm-derived intestinal smooth muscle. Genetic chimeras revealed that Uhrf1 functions both cell-autonomously in enteric neuron precursors and cell-non-autonomously in surrounding intestinal cells, consistent with what is known about signaling interactions between these cell types that promote one another's development. Uhrf1 recruits the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 to unmethylated DNA during replication. Dnmt1 is also expressed in enteric neurons and smooth muscle progenitors. dnmt1 mutants have fewer enteric neurons and disrupted intestinal smooth muscle compared to wildtypes. Because dnmt1;uhrf1 double mutants have a similar phenotype to dnmt1 and uhrf1 single mutants, Dnmt1 and Uhrf1 must function together during enteric neuron and intestinal muscle development. This work shows that genes controlling epigenetic modifications are important to coordinate intestinal tract development, provides the first demonstration that these genes influence development of the ENS, and advances uhrf1 and dnmt1 as potential new Hirschsprung disease candidates.

Extrusion pump ABCC1 was first linked with nonsyndromic hearing loss in humans by stepwise genetic analysis.||||||||To determine the genetic etiology of deafness in a family (HN-SD01) with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL).||||Stepwise genetic analysis was performed on family HN-SD01, including hotspot variant screening, exome sequencing, virtual hearing loss gene panel, and genome-wide linkage analysis. Targeted region sequencing was used to screen ABCC1 in additional cases. Cochlear expression of Abcc1 was evaluated by messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. Computational prediction, immunofluorescence, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and flow cytometry were conducted to uncover functional consequences of candidate variants.||||Stepwise genetic analysis identified a heterozygous missense variant, ABCC1:c.1769A>G (p.Asn590Ser), cosegregating with phenotype in HN-SD01. Screening of ABCC1 in an additional 217 cases identified candidate pathogenic variants c.692G>A (p.Gly231Asp) in a sporadic case and c.887A>T (p.Glu296Val) in a familial proband. Abcc1 expressed in stria vascularis and auditory nerve of mouse cochlea. Immunofluorescence showed p.Asn590Ser distributed in cytomembrane and cytoplasm, while wild type was shown only in cytomembrane. Besides, it generated unstable mRNA and decreased efflux capacity of ABCC1.||||Stepwise genetic analysis is efficient to analyze the genetic etiology of NSHL. Variants in ABCC1 are linked with NSHL and suggest an important role of extruding pumps in maintaining cochlea function.

The anti-cancer effects of phenformin in thyroid cancer cell lines and in normal thyrocytes.||||||||Phenformin is a biguanide drug which, besides the original anti-diabetic effect, also exerts anti-cancer effects. The aim of this study was to further characterize these latter in terms of both cell-viability and modulation of the secretion of the pro-tumorigenic chemokine CXCL8. Normal human thyrocytes in primary cultures (NHT) and thyroid cancer cell lines, TPC-1 and 8505C (RET/PTC and BRAFV600E mutated, respectively) were treated with increasing concentrations of phenformin at different times. Cell-viability was assessed by WST-1 and further characterized by AnnexinV/PI staining and cell proliferation colony-assay. CXCL8 levels were measured in cell supernatants. Phenformin reduced cell-viability in TPC-1 and 8505C and their ability to form colonies. In NHT cells, phenformin affected cell-viability only at the maximal dose but interestingly it inhibited CXCL8 secretion at all the concentrations not affecting cell-viability. Phenformin had no effect on CXCL8 secretion in thyroid cancer cell lines. Thus, phenformin exerts anti-cancer effects on both cancer cells (cell death induction) and surrounding normal cells (inhibition of CXCL8 secretion). These results highlight that the anti-cancer effects of phenformin are multifaceted and effective on both solid and soluble components of the tumor-microenvironment.

Interleukin-12 and -23 blockade mitigates elastase-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm.||||||||Macrophages play an important role in the inflammatory process that contributes to the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Studies of human and mouse AAA tissue reveal expanded populations of macrophages producing an abundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-12p40 and high level of metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9) at the late stages of disease. Herein, we show that blockade of IL-12p40 in the early phase of aneurysm development suppresses macrophage expansion, inflammatory cytokine and MMP-9 production and mitigates AAA development. Since IL-12 and IL-23 are related cytokines that share the common p40 subunit, we also evaluate the effect of direct IL-23 blockade on the development of AAA. Specific IL-23p19 blockade prevents AAA progression with the same efficiency as IL-12p40 antagonism, suggesting that the efficacy of anti-IL-12p40 treatment may reflect IL-23 blockade. IL-12p40 and IL-23p19 are also abundantly expressed in human AAA tissue. Our findings have potential translational value since IL-12p40 and IL-23p19 antagonists already exist as FDA-approved therapeutics for various chronic inflammatory conditions.

TNIP1-mediated TNF-α/NF-κB signalling cascade sustains glioma cell proliferation.||||||||As a malignant tumour of the central nervous system, glioma exhibits high incidence and poor prognosis. Although TNIP1 and the TNF-α/NF-κB axis play key roles in immune diseases and inflammatory responses, their relationship and role in glioma remain unknown. Here, we revealed high levels of TNIP1 and TNF-α/NF-κB in glioma tissue. Glioma cell proliferation was activated with TNF-α treatment and showed extreme sensitivity to the TNF receptor antagonist. Furthermore, loss of TNIP1 disbanded the A20 complex responsible for IκB degradation and NF-κB nucleus translocation, and consequently erased TNFα-induced glioma cell proliferation. Thus, our investigation uncovered a vital function of the TNIP1-mediated TNF-α/NF-κB axis in glioma cell proliferation and provides novel insight into glioma pathology and diagnosis.

Epiregulin is released from intervertebral disks and induces spontaneous activity in pain pathways.||||||||Lumbar radicular pain after disk herniation is associated with local release of many inflammatory molecules from nucleus pulposus (NP) cells leaking out of the intervertebral disk. Here, we have used a rat model to investigate the role of epiregulin (EREG), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, in this process.||||A protein immunoassay was chosen to confirm the release of EREG from the NP tissue. Single unit recordings were used to demonstrate the effect of recombinant EREG applied onto the dorsal nerve roots in vivo. Intracellular responses induced by recombinant EREG were studied in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells by phosphoprotein assay. Changes in EGF receptor expression induced by NP in the DRG were examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.||||The protein immunoassay showed that EREG was released from the NP tissue. Moreover, application of EREG onto the spinal dorsal nerve roots induced a decrease in the evoked responses, but an increase in spontaneous activity in the dorsal horn neurons. Interestingly, the EREG activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in the DRG, a pathway previously linked to cellular growth, proliferation, and tissue regeneration. An NP-induced upregulation of the EGF receptor HER3 in the DRG was also revealed.||||Taken together, the present observations indicate that EREG may induce changes in the DRG and spontaneous activity in the pain pathways. We suggest that EREG signaling may be involved in the pathophysiological process leading to sensory deficits and neuropathic pain in patients after disk herniation.

Systematic FTIR Spectroscopy Study of the Secondary Structure Changes in Human Serum Albumin under Various Denaturation Conditions.||||||||Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant protein in blood plasma. HSA is involved in the transport of hormones, fatty acids, and some other compounds, maintenance of blood pH, osmotic pressure, and many other functions. Although this protein is well studied, data about its conformational changes upon different denaturation factors are fragmentary and sometimes contradictory. This is especially true for FTIR spectroscopy data interpretation. Here, the effect of various denaturing agents on the structural state of HSA by using FTIR spectroscopy in the aqueous solutions was systematically studied. Our data suggest that the second derivative deconvolution method provides the most consistent interpretation of the obtained IR spectra. The secondary structure changes of HSA were studied depending on the concentration of the denaturing agent during acid, alkaline, and thermal denaturation. In general, the denaturation of HSA in different conditions is accompanied by a decrease in α-helical conformation and an increase in random coil conformation and the intermolecular β-strands. Meantime, some variation in the conformational changes depending on the type of the denaturation agent were also observed. The increase of β-structural conformation suggests that HSA may form amyloid-like aggregates upon the denaturation.

However, resistance frequently arises.||||We generated cell lines resistant to dual BRAF/MEK inhibition and utilized a pharmacologic synthetic lethal approach to identify a novel, adaptive resistance mechanism mediated through the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) pathway.||||In response to drug treatment, transcriptional upregulation of FGF1 results in autocrine activation of FGFR, which potentiates extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) activation. FGFR inhibition overcomes resistance to dual BRAF/MEK inhibitors in both cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models.

Despite using approximately 10× the peak concentration associated with clinical dosing, only moderate bacterial killing was observed. All the minocycline killing profiles in serum were inferior to those observed in CA-MHB. In contrast, the reduction in bactericidal activity seen with levofloxacin was less dramatic.||||Antimicrobial activity of minocycline was dramatically reduced in the presence of serum, which corroborated with our atypical serum protein binding findings. If validated, these results implied dose escalation might not the best approach to improve the clinical efficacy of minocycline for bacteremia. Future investigations will focus on the specificity and mechanism(s) of minocycline protein binding.

Thrombospondins differentially regulate proteins involved in arterial remodeling.||||||||Thrombospondins (TSPs) are matricellular glycoproteins expressed in response to vascular injury. TSP-1 and TSP-2 are promotors of arterial remodeling while TSP-5 is believed to be protective. The current study assessed the differential effect of TSPs on protein expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We hypothesized that TSP-1, TSP-2 and TSP-5 would regulate VSMC proteins involved in arterial remodeling. Human VSMCs were exposed to TSP-1, -2, -5 or serum free media (24 hours). Cell lysates were used to assess the targetsTSP-1, TSP-2, TSP-5 and CD44), while the culture media was used to detect TGF-?1, PDGF-BB, ANGPTL-4 and IL-8. Statistical analysis was performed by t-test and p< 0.05 was considered significant. All TSPs increased their own expression. TSP-1 and TSP-2 increased production of ANGPTL-4 and PDGF-BB. TSP-1 increased exclusively TGF-BETA1 and CD44 production. TSP-2 increased TSP-1 expression. All TSPs decreased IL-8. The findings suggest that TSP-1 and TSP-2 may promote vascular remodeling, in part, by increasing ANGPTL-4, PDGF-BB and their own expression. TSP-5 did not upregulate the inflammatory mediators TSP-1, PDGF-BB or TGF-BETA1, but upregulated its own expression, which could be a protective mechanism against the response to vascular injury.

Functions of estrogen and estrogen receptor signaling on skeletal muscle.||||||||Activity of estrogen, a sex steroid hormone, is not only limited to the reproductive organs but also involves other organs and tissues, including skeletal muscle. In postmenopausal women, estrogen decline causes endocrine and metabolic dysfunction, leading to a predisposition to osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, and decreased muscle mass and strength. The decline in skeletal muscle mass often associates with sarcopenia, a popular condition observed in fragile elder people. In addition, varying estrogen levels associated with the menstrual phases may modulate exercise performance in women. Estrogen is thus considered to play a crucial role in skeletal muscle homeostasis and exercise capacity, although its precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this article, we review the role of estrogen in the skeletal muscle, outlining the proposed molecular mechanisms. We especially focus on the current understanding of estrogen actions on mitochondria metabolism in skeletal muscle.

Encapsulation in lipid-core nanocapsules improves topical treatment with the potent antileishmanial compound CH8.||||||||Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a neglected parasitic disease conventionally treated by multiple injections with systemically toxic drugs. Aiming at a more acceptable therapy, we developed lipid-core nanocapsules (LNCs) entrapping the potent antileishmanial chalcone (CH8) for topical application. Rhodamine-labeled LNC (Rho-LNC-CH8) was produced for imaging studies. LNC-CH8 and Rho-LNC-CH8 had narrow size distributions (polydispersity index <0.10), with similar mean sizes (~180 nm) by dynamic light scattering. In vitro, Rho-LNC-CH8 was rapidly internalized by extracellular Leishmania amazonensis parasites macrophages in less than 15 min. LNC-CH8 activated macrophage oxidative mechanisms more efficiently than CH8, and was more selectively toxic against the intracellular parasites. In vivo, topically applied Rho-LNC-CH8 efficiently permeated mouse skin. In L. amazonensis-infected mice, LNC-CH8 reduced the parasite load by 86% after three weeks of daily topical treatment, while free CH8 was ineffective. In conclusion, LNC-CH8 has strong potential as a novel topical formulation for CL treatment.

The role of connexin43 in neuropathic pain induced by spinal cord injury.||||||||Neuropathic pain is caused by the damage or dysfunction of the nervous system. In many neuropathic pain models, there is an increase in the number of gap junction (GJ) channels, especially the upregulation of the expression of connexin43 (Cx43), leading to the secretion of various types of cytokines and involvement in the formation of neuropathic pain. GJs are widely distributed in mammalian organs and tissues, and Cx43 is the most abundant connexin (Cx) in mammals. Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell type in the central nervous system (CNS), which mainly express Cx43. More importantly, GJs play an important role in regulating cell metabolism, signaling, and function. Many existing literatures showed that Cx43 plays an important role in the nervous system, especially in the CNS under normal and pathological conditions. However, many internal mechanisms have not yet been thoroughly explored. In this review, we summarized the current understanding of the role and association of Cx and pannexin channels in neuropathic pain, especially after spinal cord injury, as well as some of our own insights and thoughts which suggest that Cx43 may become an emerging therapeutic target for future neuropathic pain, bringing new hope to patients.

Targeting γ-secretase triggers the selective enrichment of oligomeric APP-CTFs in brain extracellular vesicles from Alzheimer cell and mouse models.||||||||We recently demonstrated an endolysosomal accumulation of the β-secretase-derived APP C-terminal fragment (CTF) C99 in brains of Alzheimer disease (AD) mouse models. Moreover, we showed that the treatment with the γ-secretase inhibitor (D6) led to further increased endolysosomal APP-CTF levels, but also revealed extracellular APP-CTF-associated immunostaining.

The D6-induced APP-CTF oligomerization and subcellular mislocalization was indeed due to γ-secretase blockade, since it similarly occurred in presenilin-deficient fibroblasts. Further, our data proposed that besides favoring APP-CTF oligomerization by preventing C99 proteolysis, γ-secretase inhibiton also led to a defective SorLA-mediated retrograde transport of HMW APP-CTFs from endosomal compartments to the TGN.||||This is the first study to demonstrate the presence of oligomeric APP-CTFs in AD mouse models, the levels of which are selectively enriched in endolysosomal compartments including exosomes and amplified by γ-secretase inhibition.

The Molecular Mechanism of EPO Regulates the Angiogenesis after Cerebral Ischemia through AMPK-KLF2 Signaling Pathway.||||||||In this study, the molecular mechanism by which EPO regulates the angiogenesis after cerebral ischemia through AMPK-KLF2 signaling pathway was investigated.||||Sixty healthy, male, C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups of 20 mice: a sham group, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group, and a MCAO+EPO treatment group. The MCAO model was established using a modified ZeaLonga method. Mice in the EPO treatment group were injected with EPO immediately after reperfusion (5000 IU/kg), and EPO was injected the following day. The number of mouse deaths and neurologic function scores were recorded during the experiment. On day 7 after cerebral ischemia, brain tissue proteins were extracted. The following proteins expressions were detected by western blot assay: EPO, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGE), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (KDR), adenosine activated protein kinase (AMPK), and alpha HIF-1α alpha (HIF-1α), KLF2 and nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).||||Compared with the MCAO group, the survival rate of mice in the EPO group was significantly improved and neurological function was significantly improved (P < 0.01). Western blot results showed that the content of EPO in brain tissue in MCAO group significantly increased compared with sham group. The content of EPO in the brain tissue of mice in the MCAO+EPO treatment group was significantly higher than in that of the MCAO group, which indicates that EPO increased the content of EPO in mouse brain tissue. Compared with the sham group, the protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGE) and its receptor (KDR) in brain tissue of the MCAO group significantly decreased. However, the protein expression of VEGE and its receptor KDR in brain tissue of rats treated with MCAO+EPO was significantly higher than in that of the MCAO group. Thus, in this study, EPO was associated with vascular endothelial differentiation after cerebral ischemia in mice. The results of AMPK and KLF2 showed that the expression levels of AMPK and KLF2 in brain tissues of MCAO group mice significantly decreased compared with the sham group. However, the expression levels of AMPK and KLF2 in brain tissues of mice treated with MCAO+EPO were significantly higher than those in the MCAO group. Thus, EPO can activate AMPK and upregulate the expression of the transcription factor KLF2. The protein expression of HIF-1α in the brain tissue of mice in the MCAO group significantly increased compared with the sham group. However, the expression of HIF-1α in mice brain tissues in the MCAO+EPO treatment group was significantly lower than in that of the MCAO group, indicating that EPO was involved in regulating HIF-1α expression. The eNOS results showed that, compared with Sham group, the protein expression of eNOS in brain tissue of MCAO group mice significantly decreased. In the MCAO+EPO treatment group, the protein expression of eNOS was significantly higher in the brain tissue of the mice than in that of the MCAO group, indicating that EPO was involved in the synthesis of NO and promoted the angiogenesis.||||EPO promotes VEGE and its receptor (KDR) expression and participates in the regulation of HIF-1α and eNOS protein expression through the activation of AMPK-KLF2 signaling pathways to promote new vascular development after cerebral ischemia.

Is there any potential anticancer effect of raloxifene and fluoxetine on DMBA-induced rat breast cancer?||||||||Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the world and the incidence is increasing alarmingly. It was aimed to determine the effect of raloxifene (RAL) and fluoxetine (FLX) on selected parameters in 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary carcinoma. Thirty-two female Wistar albino rats were assorted into four groups: DMBA (group I), DMBA+RAL (group II), DMBA+FLX (group III), and DMBA+RAL+FLX (group IV). Mammary tissue vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) levels were determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The tissue VEGF levels were lower in group IV compared with DMBA group. Decreased M-CSF levels were observed in all therapeutic groups rather than the DMBA group, but the most effective decrease was found in group IV. Compared with the DMBA group, MMP-9 levels were statistically significantly decreased in group II and group IV. However, TIMP-1 levels were higher in the whole therapeutic groups rather than the DMBA group and the most effective increase was observed in group IV. Results of the present study suggest that combined therapy of RAL with FLX might lead to a better outcome targeting breast tumor.

We sought to find the relationship between CTCs in the pulmonary vein and postoperative PFS, besides we detected PD-L1 in CTCs.||||We enrolled 112 NSCLC patients. CTC tests were performed at four time points (preoperative, pulmonary vein, intraoperative and postoperative) on every NSCLC patient who received surgery. The RNA of PD-L1 was tested by FISH. The levels of the PD-L1 mRNA and protein in tissue samples were detected.||||The CTCs in the PV were the highest (P< 0.001), and CTCs in the PPA were the lowest (P< 0.001). The PFS in the group with PV CTCs≥ 16/5 ml was shorter than that in the group with PV CTCs< 16/5 ml (11.1 months vs 21.2 months, respectively; P< 0.001). The PFS in the group with PPA CTCs≥ 3/5 ml was shorter than that in the group with CTCs< 3/5 ml (14.8 months vs 20.7 months, respectively; P< 0.001). The CTCs in stage I were lower than those in stage II-IV (P = 0.025). No linear relationship was found between the CTCs and tumor size (P> 0.05) or LN metastasis (P> 0.05). In total, fifty-two (50.5%) patients had positive PD-L1 expression in CTC. In PD-L1-positive CTC patients, the value of PD-L1 tissue expression was higher than that in PD-L1-negative CTC patients (P = 0.0153).||||CTCs in the pulmonary vein can be an effective prognosis indicator of NSCLC patients.

Parameters of bone and body composition were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and peripheral quantitative computed tomography.||||, p < 0.0001. TRAP 5a and 5a/5b ratio increased but TRAP 5b decreased during the study. TRAP Δ5a and Δ5b correlated with Δinsulin and Δadiponectin, respectively.

At 12 weeks, TRAP 5b correlated with CTX, and Δ decrease in TRAP 5b correlated to Δ increase in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase.||||This clinical interventional study resulted in increased BMI in patients with AN. The decreased TRAP 5b protein levels confirm a role for TRAP 5b as a marker of bone resorption, whereas increased TRAP 5a seemed to derive from systemic changes in bone as well as metabolic changes.

Silencing SEC5 inhibits trophoblast invasion via integrin/Ca2+ signaling.||||||||The invasion of maternal decidua by extravillous trophoblast (EVT) is essential for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy, and abnormal trophoblast invasion could lead to placenta-associated pathologies including early pregnancy loss and preeclampsia. SEC5, a component of the exocyst complex, plays important roles in cell survival and migration, but its role in early pregnancy has not been reported. Thus, the present study was performed to explore the functions of SEC5 in trophoblast cells. The results showed that SEC5 expression in human placental villi at first trimester was significantly higher than it was at the third trimester, and it was abundently localized in the cytotrophoblast (CTB) and the trophoblastic column. SEC5 knockdown was accompanied by reduced migration and invasion in HTR-8/SVneo cells. In addition, the expression and plasma membrane distribution of integrin β1 was also decreased. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated knockdown of SEC5 inhibited the outgrowth of first trimester placental explants. SEC5 and InsP3R were colocalized in the cytoplasm of HTR-8/SVneo cells, and the cell-permeant calcium chelator BAPTA-AM could significantly inhibit HTR-8/SVneo cell invasion. The Ca2+ imaging results showed that the 10% fetal bovine serum-stimulated cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]c) was not only reduced by downregulated SEC5 but also was blocked by the InsP3R inhibitor. Furthermore, either the [Ca2+]c was buffered by BAPTA-AM or the knockdown of SEC5 disrupted HTR-8/SVneo cell F-actin stress fibers and caused cytoskeleton derangement. Taken together, our results suggest that SEC5 might be involved in regulating trophoblast cell migration and invasion through the integrin/Ca2+ signal pathway to induce cytoskeletal rearrangement.

SPARCL1 impedes trophoblast migration and invasion by down-regulating ERK phosphorylation and AP-1 production and altering EMT-related molecule expression.||||||||Embryo implantation depends on trophoblast cells migration and invasion. Abnormal function of trophoblast cells could result in many pregnancy complications. Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine like-1 (SPARCL1) has been reported to inhibit cell migration and tumor invasion. This study aimed to explore the role of SPARCL1 in trophoblast functions.||||Villous specimens were obtained from 31 women with spontaneous abortion and 31 women with normal early pregnancy to determine the expression of SPARCL1. HTR8/SVneo cells and JAR cells were transfected with pIRES2-EGFP-SPARCL1 vectors and control vectors. The proliferation assay and scratch-wound assay were performed. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting were performed to assess epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related molecules including MMP2, MMP3, N-cadherin, E-cadherin and vimentin. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation activity and AP-1 expression in HTR8/SVneo cells following multi-scratching were detected using above assays.||||The mRNA and protein levels of SPARCL1 were significantly higher in the abortion group than in the normal pregnancy group. After transfection, there was no difference of cell viability between the SPARCL1-overexpression group and control vector group. However, the migration distance and area were reduced and the abundances of EMT related molecules were changed by SPARCL1 overexpression when compared with controls. Lower ERK phosphorylation activity and decreased Fos and Jun expressions were noted at high level of SPARCL1.||||Restrained migration and invasion were noted in trophoblast cells with SPARCL1 overexpression, which might affect embryo implantation and placenta development. It could be involved in the pathogenesis of spontaneous abortion.

Loss of the serine protease HTRA1 impairs smooth muscle cells maturation.||||||||Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dysfunction is a hallmark of small vessel disease, a common cause of stroke and dementia. Two of the most frequently mutated genes in familial small vessel disease are HTRA1 and NOTCH3. The protease HTRA1 cleaves the NOTCH3 ligand JAG1 implying a mechanistic link between HTRA1 and Notch signaling. Here we report that HTRA1 is essential for VSMC differentiation into the contractile phenotype. Mechanistically, loss of HTRA1 increased JAG1 protein levels and NOTCH3 signaling activity in VSMC. In addition, the loss of HTRA1 enhanced TGFβ-SMAD2/3 signaling activity. Activation of either NOTCH3 or TGFβ signaling resulted in increased transcription of the HES and HEY transcriptional repressors and promoted the contractile VSMC phenotype. However, their combined over-activation led to an additive accumulation of HES and HEY proteins, which repressed the expression of contractile VSMC marker genes. As a result, VSMC adopted an immature phenotype with impaired arterial vasoconstriction in Htra1-deficient mice. These data demonstrate an essential role of HTRA1 in vascular maturation and homeostasis by controlling Notch and TGFβ signaling.

Arih2 gene influences immune response and tissue development in chicken.||||||||Ariadne homolog 2 (ARIH2), as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is one of the important factors involved in regulating biological functions, such as inflammation and skeletal muscle degeneration. In the present study, the full-length coding sequence of Arih2 gene was cloned from Hy-Line Brown chicken. The tissue transcriptional profiles of Arih2 gene at different developmental stages were detected using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and the Arih2 functional characteristics in immune response were analyzed. The results showed that the full-length coding sequence of Arih2 gene was 1473 bp, encoding 490 amino acids, and conservative between different species. The Arih2 gene was transcribed in various tissues at different developmental stages, and its transcriptional activities varied significantly between multiple tissues. With the development of chicken, Arih2 gene was basically up-regulated in heart, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle and glandular stomach, but fluctuated significantly in large intestine. In immune response, the transcriptional activities of Arih2 gene exhibited significant changes in the bursa, thymus and blood (P<0.05). The results showed that Arih2 might be a multifunctional gene involved in tissue development and immune response in chicken, and have a potential possible application as diagnostic marker for identifying immune response.

Caveolin-1 in skin aging - From innocent bystander to major contributor.||||||||Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) appears to be both a pathophysiological contributor and a target in different inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin conditions as well as in skin aging. Skin fibroblasts demonstrate an up-regulation of Cav-1 expression both in chronological and UV-induced aging, and such an up-regulation was observed both in vitro and in vivo. Typical alterations in aging skin involve a reduction of the dermis thickness, a significant expansion of the dermal white adipose tissue as well as modifications of the content and distribution of hyaluronan, impairment of autophagic flux, a reduction of collagen expression and an increase in tissue inflammation. All of these phenomena can be connected with changes in Cav-1 expression in the aging skin. Modified expression of Cav-1 can also significantly influence the mechanical properties of individual skin layers, thus changing the total mechanical stability of the layered composite skin/WAT, leading to typical structural modifications of the skin surface in the aging skin. Selective reduction of Cav-1 expression has the potential to exert anti-aging effects on the skin.

Preadipocyte factor 1 regulates adipose tissue browning via TNF-α-converting enzyme-mediated cleavage.||||||||Increasing adaptive thermogenesis in adipose tissue may be a potential therapeutic target for overcoming obesity and obesity-related disorders. Preadipocyte factor 1 (Pref-1), a preadipocyte secreted protein, plays an inhibitory role in adipogenic differentiation. However, the role of Pref-1 in adipose tissue browning remains unknown. We investigated whether Pref-1 regulates thermogenic program and beige fat biogenesis.||||Pref-1 expression levels were examined in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes in thermogenic conditions induced by cold exposure or a beta-adrenergic stimulus (CL316,243). Overexpression and knockdown studies were performed both in vivo and in vitro to clarify the role of Pref-1 in iWAT browning.||||Cold exposure or CL316,243 induced a thermogenic program in adipose tissue of C57BL/6N mice and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Notably, Pref-1 levels were down-regulated in iWAT and adipocytes under these conditions. Overexpressing Pref-1 showed reduced thermogenic gene expressions in response to CL316,243 treatment, whereas depletion of Pref-1 augmented thermogenic program in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Correspondingly, treating C57BL/6N mice with Pref-1 resulted in reduced expression of thermogenic and beige fat markers, a reduced rate of oxygen consumption, blunting of UCP1 expression and beige fat formation in iWAT in response to cold exposure or CL316,243 injection compared to the untreated mice. The opposite phenotype was observed in mice with inducible fat-specific knock-out of Pref-1. Mechanistically, these effects were regulated by modulation of TNF-α-converting enzyme activity and Pref-1 cleavage.||||Our findings establish a novel role of Pref-1 that regulates adaptive thermogenesis. This offers a unique target for improving energy homeostasis and treating obesity.

NURR1 activation in skeletal muscle controls systemic energy homeostasis.||||||||Skeletal muscle plays a central role in the control of metabolism and exercise tolerance. Analysis of muscle enhancers activated after exercise in mice revealed the orphan nuclear receptor NURR1/NR4A2 as a prominent component of exercise-responsive enhancers. We show that exercise enhances the expression of NURR1, and transgenic overexpression of NURR1 in skeletal muscle enhances physical performance in mice. NURR1 expression in skeletal muscle is also sufficient to prevent hyperglycemia and hepatic steatosis, by enhancing muscle glucose uptake and storage as glycogen. Furthermore, treatment of obese mice with putative NURR1 agonists increases energy expenditure, improves glucose tolerance, and confers a lean phenotype, mimicking the effects of exercise. These findings identify a key role for NURR1 in governance of skeletal muscle glucose metabolism, and reveal a transcriptional link between exercise and metabolism. Our findings also identify NURR1 agonists as possible exercise mimetics with the potential to ameliorate obesity and other metabolic abnormalities.

Its role in proliferation induced by fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) was also studied.||||Glypican 1 (GPC1) was the major expressed GPC in human keratinocytes. Its expression was up to two orders of magnitude higher than other GPCs and was significantly decreased with the age of the donors.

Epigenetic factors Dnmt1 and Uhrf1 coordinate intestinal development.||||||||Intestinal tract development is a coordinated process involving signaling among the progenitors and developing cells from all three germ layers. Development of endoderm-derived intestinal epithelium has been shown to depend on epigenetic modifications, but whether that is also the case for intestinal tract cell types from other germ layers remains unclear. We found that functional loss of a DNA methylation machinery component, ubiquitin-like protein containing PHD and RING finger domains 1 (uhrf1), leads to reduced numbers of ectoderm-derived enteric neurons and severe disruption of mesoderm-derived intestinal smooth muscle. Genetic chimeras revealed that Uhrf1 functions both cell-autonomously in enteric neuron precursors and cell-non-autonomously in surrounding intestinal cells, consistent with what is known about signaling interactions between these cell types that promote one another's development. Uhrf1 recruits the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 to unmethylated DNA during replication. Dnmt1 is also expressed in enteric neurons and smooth muscle progenitors. dnmt1 mutants have fewer enteric neurons and disrupted intestinal smooth muscle compared to wildtypes. Because dnmt1;uhrf1 double mutants have a similar phenotype to dnmt1 and uhrf1 single mutants, Dnmt1 and Uhrf1 must function together during enteric neuron and intestinal muscle development. This work shows that genes controlling epigenetic modifications are important to coordinate intestinal tract development, provides the first demonstration that these genes influence development of the ENS, and advances uhrf1 and dnmt1 as potential new Hirschsprung disease candidates.

The anti-cancer effects of phenformin in thyroid cancer cell lines and in normal thyrocytes.||||||||Phenformin is a biguanide drug which, besides the original anti-diabetic effect, also exerts anti-cancer effects. The aim of this study was to further characterize these latter in terms of both cell-viability and modulation of the secretion of the pro-tumorigenic chemokine CXCL8. Normal human thyrocytes in primary cultures (NHT) and thyroid cancer cell lines, TPC-1 and 8505C (RET/PTC and BRAFV600E mutated, respectively) were treated with increasing concentrations of phenformin at different times. Cell-viability was assessed by WST-1 and further characterized by AnnexinV/PI staining and cell proliferation colony-assay. CXCL8 levels were measured in cell supernatants. Phenformin reduced cell-viability in TPC-1 and 8505C and their ability to form colonies. In NHT cells, phenformin affected cell-viability only at the maximal dose but interestingly it inhibited CXCL8 secretion at all the concentrations not affecting cell-viability. Phenformin had no effect on CXCL8 secretion in thyroid cancer cell lines. Thus, phenformin exerts anti-cancer effects on both cancer cells (cell death induction) and surrounding normal cells (inhibition of CXCL8 secretion). These results highlight that the anti-cancer effects of phenformin are multifaceted and effective on both solid and soluble components of the tumor-microenvironment.

Interleukin-12 and -23 blockade mitigates elastase-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm.||||||||Macrophages play an important role in the inflammatory process that contributes to the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Studies of human and mouse AAA tissue reveal expanded populations of macrophages producing an abundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-12p40 and high level of metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9) at the late stages of disease. Herein, we show that blockade of IL-12p40 in the early phase of aneurysm development suppresses macrophage expansion, inflammatory cytokine and MMP-9 production and mitigates AAA development. Since IL-12 and IL-23 are related cytokines that share the common p40 subunit, we also evaluate the effect of direct IL-23 blockade on the development of AAA. Specific IL-23p19 blockade prevents AAA progression with the same efficiency as IL-12p40 antagonism, suggesting that the efficacy of anti-IL-12p40 treatment may reflect IL-23 blockade. IL-12p40 and IL-23p19 are also abundantly expressed in human AAA tissue. Our findings have potential translational value since IL-12p40 and IL-23p19 antagonists already exist as FDA-approved therapeutics for various chronic inflammatory conditions.

Epiregulin is released from intervertebral disks and induces spontaneous activity in pain pathways.||||||||Lumbar radicular pain after disk herniation is associated with local release of many inflammatory molecules from nucleus pulposus (NP) cells leaking out of the intervertebral disk. Here, we have used a rat model to investigate the role of epiregulin (EREG), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, in this process.||||A protein immunoassay was chosen to confirm the release of EREG from the NP tissue. Single unit recordings were used to demonstrate the effect of recombinant EREG applied onto the dorsal nerve roots in vivo. Intracellular responses induced by recombinant EREG were studied in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells by phosphoprotein assay. Changes in EGF receptor expression induced by NP in the DRG were examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.||||The protein immunoassay showed that EREG was released from the NP tissue. Moreover, application of EREG onto the spinal dorsal nerve roots induced a decrease in the evoked responses, but an increase in spontaneous activity in the dorsal horn neurons. Interestingly, the EREG activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in the DRG, a pathway previously linked to cellular growth, proliferation, and tissue regeneration. An NP-induced upregulation of the EGF receptor HER3 in the DRG was also revealed.||||Taken together, the present observations indicate that EREG may induce changes in the DRG and spontaneous activity in the pain pathways. We suggest that EREG signaling may be involved in the pathophysiological process leading to sensory deficits and neuropathic pain in patients after disk herniation.

GLUT12 and adipose tissue: Expression, regulation and its relation with obesity in mice.||||||||The facilitative glucose transporter GLUT12 was isolated from the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 by its homology with GLUT4. GLUT12 is expressed in insulin-sensitive tissues such as adipose tissue. The aim of this work was to investigate GLUT12 expression and hormonal regulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in adipose tissue of lean and diet-induced obese mice.||||Uptake studies were performed using radio-labelled sugars; α-methyl-d-glucose (αMG) was used as specific substrate of GLUT12. Expression and localization of GLUT12 in adipocytes were investigated by western blot and immunohistochemical methods.||||GLUT12 is expressed in the peri-nuclear region of mouse adipocytes. Insulin, by AKT activation, and TNF-α, by AMPK activation, increase αMG uptake by inducing GLUT12 translocation to the membrane. In contrast, leptin and adiponectin decrease GLUT12 activity through its internalization. Under hypoxia conditions GLUT12 expression is upregulated. The response of GLUT12 to TNF-α, leptin, adiponectin and hypoxia is the opposite to that of GLUT4. In diet-induced obese mice and obese subjects, GLUT12 protein is decreased. Intraperitoneal injection of insulin increases AKT phosphorylation and GLUT12 expression, but this effect is lost in obese animals.||||We hypothesize that GLUT12 would contribute to modulate sugar absorption in physiological and pathophysiological situations such as obesity.

Association between serum biomarkers and postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery.||||||||In cardiac surgery, patients face an increased risk of developing postoperative delirium (POD) that is associated with poor outcomes. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) have shown some promising results as potential tools for POD risk stratification, diagnosis, monitoring, and prognosis.||||Prospective single-centre study enrolled 44 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and/or valve procedures using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The patients were assessed and monitored preoperatively, during surgery, and in the early postoperative period. The blood levels of NSE and GFAP were measured before and after surgery. The early POD was assessed by CAM-ICU criteria and patients were assigned to the POD group (with POD) or to the NPOD group (without POD) retrospectively.|||| = 0.033).||||Our study demonstrated that NSE and GFAP are associated with early POD. An increase in NSE level during the perioperative period may be associated with subclinical neuronal damage. Serum GFAP levels show the damage of glial cells. Further studies are needed to find the factors influencing the individual limits of optimal MAP during surgery.

Systematic FTIR Spectroscopy Study of the Secondary Structure Changes in Human Serum Albumin under Various Denaturation Conditions.||||||||Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant protein in blood plasma. HSA is involved in the transport of hormones, fatty acids, and some other compounds, maintenance of blood pH, osmotic pressure, and many other functions. Although this protein is well studied, data about its conformational changes upon different denaturation factors are fragmentary and sometimes contradictory. This is especially true for FTIR spectroscopy data interpretation. Here, the effect of various denaturing agents on the structural state of HSA by using FTIR spectroscopy in the aqueous solutions was systematically studied. Our data suggest that the second derivative deconvolution method provides the most consistent interpretation of the obtained IR spectra. The secondary structure changes of HSA were studied depending on the concentration of the denaturing agent during acid, alkaline, and thermal denaturation. In general, the denaturation of HSA in different conditions is accompanied by a decrease in α-helical conformation and an increase in random coil conformation and the intermolecular β-strands. Meantime, some variation in the conformational changes depending on the type of the denaturation agent were also observed. The increase of β-structural conformation suggests that HSA may form amyloid-like aggregates upon the denaturation.
