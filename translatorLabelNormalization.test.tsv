Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), an uncommon malignancy in Western Countries and Radiotherapy, remains an effective treatment.	Deep radiation-induced ulcer following nasopharyngeal carcinoma: surgical management.tNasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), an uncommon malignancy in Western Countries and Radiotherapy, remains an effective treatment. Its side effects are classified as either immediate or late; postradiation necrosis is as an important late side effect with a strong impact on the prognosis in patients with NPC. We report the case of 65-year-old Caucasian man presenting with a deep necrotic ulcer of the nasopharynx and osteoradionecrosis of the skull base that appeared 3 months after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Conservative treatment was applied with surgical management of the ulcer. Clinical and radiological outcomes are presented. Radiotherapy remains a good treatment option with varying degrees of side effects, in particular, postradiation necrosis and ulcer. Multiple options of treatment have been described. However, the surgical management could be indicated in cases of deep ulcer with life-threatening prognosis.
